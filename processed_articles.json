If you work with time series data, you'll find this tool incredibly useful for various temporal adjustments.\nWhat my project does\nAdjusters are a key tool for modifying temporal objects. They exist to externalize the process of adjustment, permitting different approaches, as per the strategy design pattern.

In essence, a Temporal Adjuster is a function that encapsulates a specific date/time manipulation rule. It operates on a temporal object (representing a date, time, or datetime) to produce a new temporal object adjusted according to the rule. Examples might be an adjuster that sets the date avoiding weekends, or one that sets the date to the last day of the month."},

Similar to AutoML libraries, it has a budget parameter which ranges between (0, 1). Increasing the budget parameter increases predictive power of the algorithm and gives better results on unseen data. Start with a small budget and increase it once you are confident with your features. If you don't see any improvement with further increasing , it means that you are already extracting the most predictive power out of your data."},

{"Title": "Introducing Temporal Adjusters: Simplify Time Series Adjustments in Python!", "Author": "MDTv_Teka", "Content": "Hey guys! I'm excited to introduce Temporal Adjusters, a new Python package designed to make time series adjustments easier and more efficient. If you work with time series data, you'll find this tool incredibly useful for various temporal adjustments.\nWhat my project does\nAdjusters are a key tool for modifying temporal objects. They exist to externalize the process of adjustment, permitting different approaches, as per the strategy design pattern. Temporal Adjuster provides tools that help pinpoint very specific moments in time, without having to manually count days, weeks, or months. In essence, a Temporal Adjuster is a function that encapsulates a specific date/time manipulation rule. It operates on a temporal object (representing a date, time, or datetime) to produce a new temporal object adjusted according to the rule. Examples might be an adjuster that sets the date avoiding weekends, or one that sets the date to the last day of the month."},

Typer could've been a great tool if it was only built on top of argparse or optparse just like click (it is great but lacks good-quality documentation as said by a commenter on Reddit or Hacker News maybe).\nSee, Typer is itself written as a wrapper over click which is based on optparse which is calling functions over functions whatsoever! I know someone will come up with a joke called \"\". In general terms, it's wrapper + additional over a customizable wrapper over optparse. Which degrades the speed of execution time. I respect the project, that it simplifies the way of creating CLIs but it has a drawback, speed. I'm sceptical as to why they chose to click (for its internal dependency) over optparse or argparse for Typer development. If someone says, I don't give a this/that something your opinion. Undestand.

Increasing the budget parameter increases predictive power of the algorithm and gives better results on unseen data.

They exist to externalize the process of adjustment, permitting different approaches, as per the strategy design pattern. Temporal Adjuster provides tools that help pinpoint very specific moments in time, without having to manually count days, weeks, or months. In essence, a Temporal Adjuster is a function that encapsulates a specific date/time manipulation rule. It operates on a temporal object (representing a date, time, or datetime) to produce a new temporal object adjusted according to the rule. Examples might be an adjuster that sets the date avoiding weekends, or one that sets the date to the last day of the month."},

Typer could've been a great tool if it was only built on top of argparse or optparse just like click (it is great but lacks good-quality documentation as said by a commenter on Reddit or Hacker News maybe).\nSee, Typer is itself written as a wrapper over click which is based on optparse which is calling functions over functions whatsoever! I know someone will come up with a joke called \"\". In general terms, it's wrapper + additional over a customizable wrapper over optparse. Which degrades the speed of execution time. I respect the project, that it simplifies the way of creating CLIs but it has a drawback, speed. I'm sceptical as to why they chose to click (for its internal dependency) over optparse or argparse for Typer development. If someone says, I don't give a this/that something your opinion. Undestand.

{"Title": "Introducing Temporal Adjusters: Simplify Time Series Adjustments in Python!", "Author": "MDTv_Teka", "Content": "Hey guys! I'm excited to introduce Temporal Adjusters, a new Python package designed to make time series adjustments easier and more efficient. If you work with time series data, you'll find this tool incredibly useful for various temporal adjustments.\nWhat my project does\nAdjusters are a key tool for modifying temporal objects. They exist to externalize the process of adjustment, permitting different approaches, as per the strategy design pattern. Temporal Adjuster provides tools that help pinpoint very specific moments in time, without having to manually count days, weeks, or months. In essence, a Temporal Adjuster is a function that encapsulates a specific date/time manipulation rule. It operates on a temporal object (representing a date, time, or datetime) to produce a new temporal object adjusted according to the rule. Examples might be an adjuster that sets the date avoiding weekends, or one that sets the date to the last day of the month."},

Typer could've been a great tool if it was only built on top of argparse or optparse just like click (it is great but lacks good-quality documentation as said by a commenter on Reddit or Hacker News maybe).\nSee, Typer is itself written as a wrapper over click which is based on optparse which is calling functions over functions whatsoever! I know someone will come up with a joke called \"\". In general terms, it's wrapper + additional over a customizable wrapper over optparse. Which degrades the speed of execution time. I respect the project, that it simplifies the way of creating CLIs but it has a drawback, speed.

Typer could've been a great tool if it was only built on top of argparse or optparse just like click (it is great but lacks good-quality documentation as said by a commenter on Reddit or Hacker News maybe).\nSee, Typer is itself written as a wrapper over click which is based on optparse which is calling functions over functions whatsoever! I know someone will come up with a joke called \"\". In general terms, it's wrapper + additional over a customizable wrapper over optparse. Which degrades the speed of execution time. I respect the project, that it simplifies the way of creating CLIs but it has a drawback, speed.

Similar to AutoML libraries, it has a budget parameter which ranges between (0, 1). Increasing the budget parameter increases predictive power of the algorithm and gives better results on unseen data. Start with a small budget and increase it once you are confident with your features. If you don't see any improvement with further increasing , it means that you are already extracting the most predictive power out of your data."},

They exist to externalize the process of adjustment, permitting different approaches, as per the strategy design pattern. Temporal Adjuster provides tools that help pinpoint very specific moments in time, without having to manually count days, weeks, or months. In essence, a Temporal Adjuster is a function that encapsulates a specific date/time manipulation rule. It operates on a temporal object (representing a date, time, or datetime) to produce a new temporal object adjusted according to the rule. Examples might be an adjuster that sets the date avoiding weekends, or one that sets the date to the last day of the month."},

Typer could've been a great tool if it was only built on top of argparse or optparse just like click (it is great but lacks good-quality documentation as said by a commenter on Reddit or Hacker News maybe).\nSee, Typer is itself written as a wrapper over click which is based on optparse which is calling functions over functions whatsoever! I know someone will come up with a joke called \"\". In general terms, it's wrapper + additional over a customizable wrapper over optparse. Which degrades the speed of execution time. I respect the project, that it simplifies the way of creating CLIs but it has a drawback, speed. I'm sceptical as to why they chose to click (for its internal dependency) over optparse or argparse for Typer development. If someone says, I don't give a this/that something your opinion. Undestand.

It includes a test suite of 116 tasks across 20 real-world apps to evaluate agent performance. Think of each task like a unit test, with a setup, evaluation, and tear down procedure. Every task is written in Python. The most powerful agents should be able to pass all of them. Target Audience: Anyone looking to experiment with LLM for controlling Android UIs. You can download any app you’d like and test out the default agent, M3A, on it. Just give it a task like “Show my most recent purchases on Amazon.” You can also build your own agent."},

I noticed you can also manage python installations with uv using `uv toolchain` command (i.e. be like pyenv) and run tools (like a smaller version of pipx) with `uv run`. I'm genuinely excited about this, Python packaging is going to become such a smooth experience 😎 Commands are in preview so expect missing stuff."},

Over time, the codebase would become tightly coupled together, making even simple changes/refactors painful. By setting up module boundaries and enforcing them early on, you can avoid all of this!"},

I'm the CEO of the company that built an SDK that makes it easy to build custom code interpreters for AI apps. We're a company called E2B [0]. We're building and open-source [1] secure environments for running untrusted AI-generated code and AI agents. We call these environments sandboxes and they are built on top of micro VM called Firecracker [2]. We specifically decided to use Firecrackers instead of containers because of their security and ability to do snapshots. You can think of us as giving small cloud computers to LLMs. We recently created a dedicated SDK for building custom code interpreters in Python or JS/TS. We saw this need after a lot of our users have been adding code execution capabilities to their AI apps with our core SDK [3].

I'm the CEO of the company that built an SDK that makes it easy to build custom code interpreters for AI apps. We're a company called E2B [0]. We're building and open-source [1] secure environments for running untrusted AI-generated code and AI agents. We call these environments sandboxes and they are built on top of micro VM called Firecracker [2]. We specifically decided to use Firecrackers instead of containers because of their security and ability to do snapshots. You can think of us as giving small cloud computers to LLMs. We recently created a dedicated SDK for building custom code interpreters in Python or JS/TS. We saw this need after a lot of our users have been adding code execution capabilities to their AI apps with our core SDK [3]. These use cases were often centered around AI data analysis so code interpreter-like behavior made sense"},

For anyone who has used cython, could you give any details about your experience with introducing it gradually, how it changed the deployment and execution processes, how well it played with code that is calling lots of 3rd party frameworks. Also curious to hear about any headaches or issues it introduced. I'm less interested in the performance benefits, more interested in static type checks. I do use mypy already but I'm left quite lacking with it compared to real compilation checks. I'm curious more generally about the possibility of having a code base that mixes static and dynamic typing, and if I could stay in Python while doing that instead of going to Rust that would really simplify things."},

This project might have thrived with sufficient contributions and could have changed the way apps are built. However, the project is now archived on GitHub. The last commit was 5 years ago (LICENSE), and the last development commit was 9 years ago. This repository needs someone to revive it, but I don't have enough experience to take on that task. Even though I don't have enough information, we should start with Rust + Python to build a compiler (aka. template replacer) (this doesn't compile Python but replaces all JSX with a dictionary) and cleaner syntax.

Often, an LLM's internal knowledge base is adequate for answering users questions. However, in those cases, the model may generate outdated, incorrect, or too generic responses when specificity is expected. These challenges can be partially addressed by supplementing the LLM with an external knowledge base and employing the retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) technique. However, if user queries are complex, it may be necessary to break the task into several sub-parts. In such cases, relying solely on the RAG technique may not be sufficient, and the use of agents may be required."},

Integration with Django (Packed has an example too), Flask, FastAPI, Robyn etc."},

I am a sucker for optimization. So when I heard about 1BRC I got intrigued and in the last few days started experimenting with python implementations. I achieved my goal and implemented the fastest implementation running on CPython, without any external libraries. My motivation for CPython was so that I can apply any of the learning's in my day to day work, as I don't see us moving to PyPy any time sooner."},

Often, an LLM's internal knowledge base is adequate for answering users questions. However, in those cases, the model may generate outdated, incorrect, or too generic responses when specificity is expected. These challenges can be partially addressed by supplementing the LLM with an external knowledge base and employing the retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) technique. However, if user queries are complex, it may be necessary to break the task into several sub-parts. In such cases, relying solely on the RAG technique may not be sufficient, and the use of agents may be required."},

Has this kind of thing been discussed before, and is it Pythonic it could allow a lot of Python code to be shorter. Python has sys.set_trace that sort of allows some form of programmable semantics but its mostly for debugging. Programmable assignment(variables) are like setters/getters/properties, but instead of being run on o.x = 5, you could run them on \"all local assignments\" isnside a context manager or in a decorated function. On every assignment you could do stuff like log the values, update dependencies, notify objects, do a database transaction, do persistance, calculate other values, without having to explicitly do so for every assignment statement."},

Often, an LLM's internal knowledge base is adequate for answering users questions. However, in those cases, the model may generate outdated, incorrect, or too generic responses when specificity is expected. These challenges can be partially addressed by supplementing the LLM with an external knowledge base and employing the retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) technique. However, if user queries are complex, it may be necessary to break the task into several sub-parts. In such cases, relying solely on the RAG technique may not be sufficient, and the use of agents may be required."},

Often, an LLM's internal knowledge base is adequate for answering users questions. However, in those cases, the model may generate outdated, incorrect, or too generic responses when specificity is expected. These challenges can be partially addressed by supplementing the LLM with an external knowledge base and employing the retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) technique. However, if user queries are complex, it may be necessary to break the task into several sub-parts. In such cases, relying solely on the RAG technique may not be sufficient, and the use of agents may be required."},

Over the years I've tried many different established python GUI frameworks, but none of them really satisfied me. So I teamed up with a few like minded developers and spent the last few months to create our own framework. Rio is the result of this effort. What My Project Does Rio is a brand new GUI framework that lets you create modern web apps in just a few lines of Python. Our goal is to simplify web and app development, so you can focus on the things you care about, instead of wasting countless hours on frustrating user interface details. We do this by following the core principles of Python that we all know and love. Python is supposed to be simple and compact - and so is Rio. There is no need to learn any additional languages such as HTML, CSS or JavaScript, because all of the UI, Logic, Components and even layouting is done entirely in Python. There’s not even a distinction between front-end and back-end. Rio handles all of the communication transparently for you."},

Python has sys.set_trace that sort of allows some form of programmable semantics but its mostly for debugging. Programmable assignment(variables) are like setters/getters/properties, but instead of being run on o.x = 5, you could run them on \"all local assignments\" isnside a context manager or in a decorated function. On every assignment you could do stuff like log the values, update dependencies, notify objects, do a database transaction, do persistance, calculate other values, without having to explicitly do so for every assignment statement."},
{"Title": "Rethinking String Encoding: a 37.5% space efficient string encoding than UTF-8 in Apache Fury", "Author": "Shawn-Yang25", "Content": "In rpc/serialization systems, we often need to send namespace/path/filename/fieldName/packageName/moduleName/className/enumValue string between processes.\nThose strings are mostly ascii strings. In order to transfer between processes, we encode such strings using utf-8 encodings. Such encoding will take one byte for every char, which is not space efficient actually.\nIf we take a deeper look, we will found that most chars are lowercase chars, ., $ and _, which can be expressed in a much smaller range 0~32. But one byte can represent range 0~255, the significant bits are wasted, and this cost is not ignorable. In a dynamic serialization framework, such meta will take considerable cost compared to actual data.\nSo we proposed a new string encoding which we called meta string encoding in Fury. It will encode most chars using 5 bits instead of 8 bits in utf-8 encoding, which can bring 37.5% space cost savings compared to utf-8 encoding.\nFor string can't be represented by 5 bits, we also proposed encoding using 6 bits which can bring 25% space cost savings"},

Given a job description as input, the system retrieves the most relevant candidate profiles to perform follow-up tasks such as analysis, summarization, and decision-making, which can assist the screening process better. The revolving idea is that the similarity-based retrieval process can effectively narrow the initial large pool of applicants down to the most relevant resumes. However, this simple similarity ranking should not be used to evaluate a candidate's actual ability. Therefore, the top resumes are used to augment the GPT-4 Chatbot so it can be conditioned on these profiles and perform further downstream tasks."},

I've tried to use CMake but can't seem to get it to work without a lot of custom scripting (for example the AUTOUIC etc functions need c++ projects), can't see any info on running uic in QtCreator (which would be ideal but python support is really just an after thought). I could write some Makefiles but this is a little ad-hoc and also confuses the IDE's (and at the end of the day I want a simple process for my students to use and I already teach cmake for C++ dev)."},

Amongst many features, NiFi allows for Command & Control via a native UI, enabling live edits to data routing and transformation. NiFi also enforces an API-first approach, and produces a swagger definition during code compilation, which allowed creation of a Python client to enable automated Data Flow testing and a Design & Deploy approach by running it through tool shaped by mustache templates.

I recently finished a small side project for my graduating thesis, which is about experimenting with RAG-based frameworks in improving resume screening. What my project does: The project for the thesis is a GPT-4 Chatbot with RAG Fusion retrieval. Given a job description as input, the system retrieves the most relevant candidate profiles to perform follow-up tasks such as analysis, summarization, and decision-making, which can assist the screening process better. The revolving idea is that the similarity-based retrieval process can effectively narrow the initial large pool of applicants down to the most relevant resumes. However, this simple similarity ranking should not be used to evaluate a candidate's actual ability. Therefore, the top resumes are used to augment the GPT-4 Chatbot so it can be conditioned on these profiles and perform further downstream tasks."},

Over the years I've tried many different established python GUI frameworks, but none of them really satisfied me. So I teamed up with a few like minded developers and spent the last few months to create our own framework. Rio is the result of this effort. What My Project Does Rio is a brand new GUI framework that lets you create modern web apps in just a few lines of Python. Our goal is to simplify web and app development, so you can focus on the things you care about, instead of wasting countless hours on frustrating user interface details. We do this by following the core principles of Python that we all know and love. Python is supposed to be simple and compact - and so is Rio. There is no need to learn any additional languages such as HTML, CSS or JavaScript, because all of the UI, Logic, Components and even layouting is done entirely in Python. There’s not even a distinction between front-end and back-end. Rio handles all of the communication transparently for you."},

In order to transfer between processes, we encode such strings using utf-8 encodings. Such encoding will take one byte for every char, which is not space efficient actually.\nIf we take a deeper look, we will found that most chars are lowercase chars, ., $ and _, which can be expressed in a much smaller range 0~32. But one byte can represent range 0~255, the significant bits are wasted, and this cost is not ignorable. In a dynamic serialization framework, such meta will take considerable cost compared to actual data.\nSo we proposed a new string encoding which we called meta string encoding in Fury. It will encode most chars using 5 bits instead of 8 bits in utf-8 encoding, which can bring 37.5% space cost savings compared to utf-8 encoding.\nFor string can't be represented by 5 bits, we also proposed encoding using 6 bits which can bring 25% space cost savings"},

It then goes through the list to remove any duplicates and also tries to remove any unwanted versions (only done by examining the name of the track, since Spotify does not attribute a version type to its tracks). Once that's done a playlist is then created on your Spotify account with the name of the Artist and all the tracks are posted there in chronological (essentially per album) order."},

{"Title": "Opinions sought: Modernising the Apache NiFi Python client", "Author": "Samausi", "Content": "Hello folks, I am the author of NiPyAPI, the defacto Python client for the Apache NiFi project. For those unfamiliar, Apache NiFi is an open-source ETL tool designed around the flow-based programming paradigm. It excels at continuously moving and managing arbitrary data flows between disparate systems with low latency at large scale, and is often contrasted with Airflow. Amongst many features, NiFi allows for Command & Control via a native UI, enabling live edits to data routing and transformation. NiFi also enforces an API-first approach, and produces a swagger definition during code compilation, which allowed creation of a Python client to enable automated Data Flow testing and a Design & Deploy approach by running it through tool shaped by mustache templates. This produces a verbose low-level client, which I then leverage in higher-level operational functions and demo scripts in the library."},

There are occasions (such as when working with a server) where MatPlotLib is not an option and the terminal is the only available tool.

That’s why homoiconic languages like Lisp are so powerful. But what if we can make a homoiconic python code, where the code and the data are one and the same and can be modified in the same way? This guide does a good job in trying to explain how you would create a python version of the “Lisp in Lisp” code which would give you access to all those homoiconic features that Lisp brags of like the macro systems, the expressiveness and flexibility, the metaprogramming etc. while still using python.

{"Title": "Building an LLM chat application using RAG Agent", "Author": "iryna_kondr", "Content": "Motivation\nChatbots are among the most popular applications of large language models (LLMs). Often, an LLM's internal knowledge base is adequate for answering users questions. However, in those cases, the model may generate outdated, incorrect, or too generic responses when specificity is expected. These challenges can be partially addressed by supplementing the LLM with an external knowledge base and employing the retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) technique. However, if user queries are complex, it may be necessary to break the task into several sub-parts. In such cases, relying solely on the RAG technique may not be sufficient, and the use of agents may be required."},

The revolving idea is that the similarity-based retrieval process can effectively narrow the initial large pool of applicants down to the most relevant resumes.

Currently it supports SQLModel and SQLAlchemy ORMs. Recently I wanted to add pagination in one of my Python projects and in the API response, I had to return a string next page token. Now I could not find a straight-forward way of doing this in Python. All of the tutorials or blog posts I saw, there in the response the server always returned a page_number, page_size, and total_elements and then the onus was on the calling service to adjust this accordingly.  Comparison - The current packages and methods requires some changes in the app layer as well. I tried using a few but those did not satisfy the use case and were also a bit harder to implement. I could not find a easy to use option. The present ones returned integers instead of a string token"},

Given a job description as input, the system retrieves the most relevant candidate profiles to perform follow-up tasks such as analysis, summarization, and decision-making, which can assist the screening process better. The revolving idea is that the similarity-based retrieval process can effectively narrow the initial large pool of applicants down to the most relevant resumes. However, this simple similarity ranking should not be used to evaluate a candidate's actual ability. Therefore, the top resumes are used to augment the GPT-4 Chatbot so it can be conditioned on these profiles and perform further downstream tasks."},

In order to transfer between processes, we encode such strings using utf-8 encodings. Such encoding will take one byte for every char, which is not space efficient actually.\nIf we take a deeper look, we will found that most chars are lowercase chars, ., $ and _, which can be expressed in a much smaller range 0~32. But one byte can represent range 0~255, the significant bits are wasted, and this cost is not ignorable. In a dynamic serialization framework, such meta will take considerable cost compared to actual data.\nSo we proposed a new string encoding which we called meta string encoding in Fury. It will encode most chars using 5 bits instead of 8 bits in utf-8 encoding, which can bring 37.5% space cost savings compared to utf-8 encoding.\nFor string can't be represented by 5 bits, we also proposed encoding using 6 bits which can bring 25% space cost savings"},

Often, an LLM's internal knowledge base is adequate for answering users questions. However, in those cases, the model may generate outdated, incorrect, or too generic responses when specificity is expected. These challenges can be partially addressed by supplementing the LLM with an external knowledge base and employing the retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) technique. However, if user queries are complex, it may be necessary to break the task into several sub-parts. In such cases, relying solely on the RAG technique may not be sufficient, and the use of agents may be required."},

{"Title": "I made a React-like web framework for Python 👋", "Author": "Rawing7", "Content": "I'm Paul, one of the creators of Rio. Over the years I've tried many different established python GUI frameworks, but none of them really satisfied me. So I teamed up with a few like minded developers and spent the last few months to create our own framework. Rio is the result of this effort. What My Project Does Rio is a brand new GUI framework that lets you create modern web apps in just a few lines of Python. Our goal is to simplify web and app development, so you can focus on the things you care about, instead of wasting countless hours on frustrating user interface details. We do this by following the core principles of Python that we all know and love. Python is supposed to be simple and compact - and so is Rio. There is no need to learn any additional languages such as HTML, CSS or JavaScript, because all of the UI, Logic, Components and even layouting is done entirely in Python. There’s not even a distinction between front-end and back-end. Rio handles all of the communication transparently for you."},
{"Title": "Opinions sought: Modernising the Apache NiFi Python client", "Author": "Samausi", "Content": "Hello folks, I am the author of NiPyAPI, the defacto Python client for the Apache NiFi project. For those unfamiliar, Apache NiFi is an open-source ETL tool designed around the flow-based programming paradigm. It excels at continuously moving and managing arbitrary data flows between disparate systems with low latency at large scale, and is often contrasted with Airflow. Amongst many features, NiFi allows for Command & Control via a native UI, enabling live edits to data routing and transformation. NiFi also enforces an API-first approach, and produces a swagger definition during code compilation, which allowed creation of a Python client to enable automated Data Flow testing and a Design & Deploy approach by running it through tool shaped by mustache templates. This produces a verbose low-level client, which I then leverage in higher-level operational functions and demo scripts in the library."},

This is third-party code which often means open-source software, also known as running code from strangers on the internet. The prized goal for attackers is arbitrary code execution. It’s the stuff high CVE scores are made of and often the topic of how vulnerabilities can turn into exploits. It’s the foothold needed to run cryptominers, steal secrets, or encrypt data for ransom. It’s no wonder why threat actors want it, but how do they get it? Sutton’s Law makes it obvious why they go after open-source software: because executing arbitrary code is easy there."},

But, in my opinion, it is actually faster to use this tool (itrm) to zoom in on interesting parts of data and analyze patterns than using other tools like MatPlotLib. In fact, with large data sets (~1 million points), this tool actually renders faster than MatPlotLib. Please check it out and let know what you think."},

Given a job description as input, the system retrieves the most relevant candidate profiles to perform follow-up tasks such as analysis, summarization, and decision-making, which can assist the screening process better. The revolving idea is that the similarity-based retrieval process can effectively narrow the initial large pool of applicants down to the most relevant resumes. However, this simple similarity ranking should not be used to evaluate a candidate's actual ability. Therefore, the top resumes are used to augment the GPT-4 Chatbot so it can be conditioned on these profiles and perform further downstream tasks."},

Gigabytes of space are left on disks as processes vie for memory. Memcached (and sometimes Redis) is used as a cache among these processes. Wouldn’t it be nice to leverage empty disk space for caching? Django is Python’s most popular web framework and has several caching backends. Unfortunately, the file-based cache in Django is essentially broken. The culling method is random and large caches repeatedly scan a cache directory which slows linearly with growth. Can you allow it to take sixty milliseconds to store a key in a cache with a thousand items?"},

{"Title": "How Malicious Python Code Gains Execution", "Author": "louis11", "Content": "The primary vector for malicious code running in software developer environments (e.g., local system, CI/CD runners, production servers, etc.) is software dependencies. This is third-party code which often means open-source software, also known as running code from strangers on the internet. The prized goal for attackers is arbitrary code execution. It’s the stuff high CVE scores are made of and often the topic of how vulnerabilities can turn into exploits. It’s the foothold needed to run cryptominers, steal secrets, or encrypt data for ransom. It’s no wonder why threat actors want it, but how do they get it? Sutton’s Law makes it obvious why they go after open-source software: because executing arbitrary code is easy there."},

Target audience My personal use-case is for my research, where I run long simulations (~72 hours) on a computing cluster. These simulations generate log files, so I can send myself the log file after the simulation, letting me: - Know that the simulation is done - Check that the simulation ran as intended without having to SSH into the cluster.

For those unfamiliar, Apache NiFi is an open-source ETL tool designed around the flow-based programming paradigm. It excels at continuously moving and managing arbitrary data flows between disparate systems with low latency at large scale, and is often contrasted with Airflow. Amongst many features, NiFi allows for Command & Control via a native UI, enabling live edits to data routing and transformation. NiFi also enforces an API-first approach, and produces a swagger definition during code compilation, which allowed creation of a Python client to enable automated Data Flow testing and a Design & Deploy approach by running it through tool shaped by mustache templates. This produces a verbose low-level client, which I then leverage in higher-level operational functions and demo scripts in the library."},

Given a job description as input, the system retrieves the most relevant candidate profiles to perform follow-up tasks such as analysis, summarization, and decision-making, which can assist the screening process better. The revolving idea is that the similarity-based retrieval process can effectively narrow the initial large pool of applicants down to the most relevant resumes. However, this simple similarity ranking should not be used to evaluate a candidate's actual ability. Therefore, the top resumes are used to augment the GPT-4 Chatbot so it can be conditioned on these profiles and perform further downstream tasks."},

It’s the stuff high CVE scores are made of and often the topic of how vulnerabilities can turn into exploits. It’s the foothold needed to run cryptominers, steal secrets, or encrypt data for ransom. It’s no wonder why threat actors want it, but how do they get it? Sutton’s Law makes it obvious why they go after open-source software: because executing arbitrary code is easy there."},

{"Title": "Interactive plots in the terminal", "Author": "Spiffidimus", "Content": "I made a library to create interactive plots in the terminal (pip install itrm). It uses braille characters (by default) to display the data with sub-character resolution. There are several keybindings for moving a vertical cursor left and right, for zooming in or out on data, and for changing which curve to focus on. There are occasions (such as when working with a server) where MatPlotLib is not an option and the terminal is the only available tool. But, in my opinion, it is actually faster to use this tool (itrm) to zoom in on interesting parts of data and analyze patterns than using other tools like MatPlotLib. In fact, with large data sets (~1 million points), this tool actually renders faster than MatPlotLib. Please check it out and let know what you think."},

I have made it \"secured\" by implementing an API key in order call those endpoints. I was wondering, how common it is for people to use services that can be self-hosted as their authentication/authorization. If it is common and reliable, what are the best options to go for? I've read that building your own authentication/authorization service with email verification, password reset, and social auth can be a pain. Also, did some googling and found this General - Fief. Has anyone ever tried using this? If so, how was the experience?"},

Now since the server wasn't running on my computer (and since Aternos has a timeout policy to save server resources) it became annoying for my buddies to hop on the server if I was busy. They'd have to ask me to manually start the server from the webpage. So I had a free Saturday a couple of months ago and decided to remedy this problem. My source code is hosted on a GIGO Dev environment if y'all wanna check it out:"},
{"Title": "ArchiveFile: Unified interface for tar, zip, sevenzip, and rar files", "Author": "PredatorOwl", "Content": "What My Project Does archivefile is a wrapper around tarfile, zipfile, py7zr, and rarfile. The above libraries are excellent when you are dealing with a single archive format but things quickly get annoying when you have a bunch of mixed archives such as .zip, .7z, .cbr, .tar.gz, etc because each library has a slightly different syntax and quirks which you need to deal with. archivefile wraps the common methods from the above libraries to provide a unified interface that takes care of said differences under the hood. However, it's not as powerful as the libraries it wraps due to lack of support for features that are unique to a specific archive format and library."},

You can find IBind on GitHub: https://github.com/Voyz/ibind What My Project Does: It is a REST and WebSocket API for the Interactive Brokers' Web API. I'm particularly proud of a few things in this release:\nThe REST and WebSocket API clients are based on an abstract base class RestClient and WsClient accordingly. These could be implemented to use some other Web APIs in a relatively straightforward way. I have in fact used a version of that for a cryptocurrency WebSocket API, and it is nice to see it adapt to a different environment."},
