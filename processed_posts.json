A linter, like Ruff, is a tool that analyzes your code and looks for errors, stylistic issues, and suspicious constructs. Linting allows you to address issues and improve your code quality before you commit your code and share it with others.\n  \n\n    Ruff is a modern linter that‚Äôs extremely fast and has a simple interface, making it straightforward to use. It also aims to be a drop-in replacement for many other linting and formatting tools, such as Flake8, isort, and Black. It‚Äôs quickly becoming one of the most popular Python linters.\n  \nInstalling Ruff\n\n    Now that you know why linting your code is important and how Ruff is a powerful tool for the job, it‚Äôs time to install it. Thankfully, Ruff works out of the box, so no complicated installation instructions or configurations are needed to start using it.\n  \n\n    Assuming your project is already set up with a virtual environment, you can install Ruff in the following ways:\n  \n```bash\n$ python -m pip install ruff\n```\n\nYou can check that Ruff installed correctly by using the ruff version command:\n\n```bash\n$ ruff version\nruff 0.4.7\n```\nLinting Your Python Code\n\n    While linting helps keep your code consistent and error-free, it doesn‚Äôt guarantee that your code will be bug-free. Finding the bugs in your code is best handled with a debugger and adequate testing, which won‚Äôt be covered in this tutorial. Coming up in the next sections, you‚Äôll learn how to use Ruff to check for errors and speed up your workflow.\n  \nChecking for Errors\n```bash\n$ ruff check\none_ring.py:1:8: F401 [*] `os` imported but unused\none_ring.py:10:12: F821 Undefined name `name`\nFound 2 errors.\n[*] 1 fixable with the `--fix` option.\n```\n\n    Success! Ruff found two errors. Not only does it show the file and line numbers of the errors, but it also gives you error codes and messages. In addition, it lets you know that one of the two errors is fixable. Great!\n  \n\n    You can tell Ruff to fix errors by applying the --fix flag. Here‚Äôs what happens when you follow its suggestion:\n  \n```bash\n$ ruff check --fix\none_ring.py:9:12: F821 Undefined name `name`\nFound 2 errors (1 fixed, 1 remaining).\n```\n\n    You can find the rest of this Free tutorial \nhere"},

The other day I remembered the game mentioned in the title and we had lots of fun playing it (there's 3 different games in this series). I decided I'd transfer the save file to my main PC so I can play when he's not visiting and I quickly learned it's an extremely annoying process to transfer save files across different PCs. Long story short, you need to find a proper registry key (which isn't always located at same spot for some reason) and you need to locate a system.dat file also located in a folder that isn't always in the same place. This process gets tedious pretty quick, so I decided to use the power of Python to make my life easier.\n  \n\n    What the project does:\n  \n\n    It's essentially a CLI save handler for the game mentioned in the title. It has 5 slots where you can backup your current save or load the backup to the computer. It can also fix minor registry issues if needed.\n  \n\n    Target audience:\n  \n\n    Given that I'm about 20 years too late... I'd say mostly people with very slow PCs or people who like to inhale nostalgia.\n  \n\n    I learned a lot about using winreg and msvcrt and getch, so while I will likely get bored of the game in the coming weeks, I'm happy I learned something new in the meantime, plus maybe someone finds it useful!\n  \n\n    Source code: \nmarkomavrinac/yugioh_poc_save_handler: Yu-Gi-Oh!
