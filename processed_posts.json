For example, let’s say I have a data frame where one of the columns is named “colors” and each record contains a list of colors. One record might be [black,blue,yellow] another record might have [blue,yellow,black]. The visual had two parts where the top was a column chart to show the frequency of the list combinations and below the column chart was more of a table that showed each “color” as one column and then across the row for each color and under the columns from the chart above was an indicator of sorts that would be greyed out of the color for that row was not in the corresponding columns list and highlighted another color of it was. Anyways this is probably a long shot but either the package or the name of this visual would be super helpful. Thanks python community!"},

One record might be [black,blue,yellow] another record might have [blue,yellow,black]. The visual had two parts where the top was a column chart to show the frequency of the list combinations and below the column chart was more of a table that showed each “color” as one column and then across the row for each color and under the columns from the chart above was an indicator of sorts that would be greyed out of the color for that row was not in the corresponding columns list and highlighted another color of it was.

{"Title": "Ruff: A Modern Python Linter for Error-Free and Maintainable Code", "Author": "u/ajpinedam", "Content": "Linting is essential to writing clean and readable code to share with others. A linter, like Ruff, is a tool that analyzes your code and looks for errors, stylistic issues, and suspicious constructs. Linting allows you to address issues and improve your code quality before you commit your code and share it with others.\n  \n\n    Ruff is a modern linter that’s extremely fast and has a simple interface, making it straightforward to use. It also aims to be a drop-in replacement for many other linting and formatting tools, such as Flake8, isort, and Black. It’s quickly becoming one of the most popular Python linters.\n  \nInstalling Ruff\n\n    Now that you know why linting your code is important and how Ruff is a powerful tool for the job, it’s time to install it. Thankfully, Ruff works out of the box, so no complicated installation instructions or configurations are needed to start using it.\n  \n\n    Assuming your project is already set up with a virtual environment, you can install Ruff in the following ways:\n  \n```bash\n$ python -m pip install ruff\n```\n\nYou can check that Ruff installed correctly by using the ruff version command:\n\n```bash\n$ ruff version\nruff 0.4.7\n```\nLinting Your Python Code\n\n    While linting helps keep your code consistent and error-free, it doesn’t guarantee that your code will be bug-free. Finding the bugs in your code is best handled with a debugger and adequate testing, which won’t be covered in this tutorial. Coming up in the next sections, you’ll learn how to use Ruff to check for errors and speed up your workflow.\n  \nChecking for Errors\n```bash\n$ ruff check\none_ring.py:1:8: F401 [*] `os` imported but unused\none_ring.py:10:12: F821 Undefined name `name`\nFound 2 errors.\n[*] 1 fixable with the `--fix` option.\n```\n\n    Success! Ruff found two errors. Not only does it show the file and line numbers of the errors, but it also gives you error codes and messages. In addition, it lets you know that one of the two errors is fixable. Great!\n  \n\n    You can tell Ruff to fix errors by applying the --fix flag. Here’s what happens when you follow its suggestion:\n  \n```bash\n$ ruff check --fix\none_ring.py:9:12: F821 Undefined name `name`\nFound 2 errors (1 fixed, 1 remaining).\n```\n\n    You can find the rest of this Free tutorial \nhere"},

The other day I remembered the game mentioned in the title and we had lots of fun playing it (there's 3 different games in this series). I decided I'd transfer the save file to my main PC so I can play when he's not visiting and I quickly learned it's an extremely annoying process to transfer save files across different PCs. Long story short, you need to find a proper registry key (which isn't always located at same spot for some reason) and you need to locate a system.dat file also located in a folder that isn't always in the same place. This process gets tedious pretty quick, so I decided to use the power of Python to make my life easier.\n  \n\n    What the project does:\n  \n\n    It's essentially a CLI save handler for the game mentioned in the title. It has 5 slots where you can backup your current save or load the backup to the computer. It can also fix minor registry issues if needed.\n  \n\n    Target audience:\n  \n\n    Given that I'm about 20 years too late...

You could use a defaultdict of lists, but then you have these disadvantages:\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n    you can end up with empty lists within the dict if you aren't careful\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n    you lose the order of individual items within the dict:\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nitems = [(1, '1'), (2, '2'), (2, '22'), (1, '11')]\nnormal_dict = defaultdict(list)\nfor key, value in items:\n    normal_dict [key].append(value)\nom_dict = OrderedMultiDict(items)\nprint(list(normal_dict .items)) # prints [(1, ['1', '11']), (2, ['2', '22'])] \nprint(list(om\\_dict.items))     # prints [(1, '1'), (2, '2'), (2, '22'), (1, '11')]\n\n\n\n\n\n    iterating over all key/value pairs can be cumbersome as you need nested loops\n  \n\n\n\n\nComparison to \nomdict\n.\n\n\nOederedDict\n provides a (in my opinion) nicer interface with less surprising behavior or pitfalls. My implementation is also faster. e.g iterating over all items is ~5x faster.\n  \nMore info\n\n    This started as a toy project, that later became useful to me, so I decided to cleanup the code, add tests, and publish it.\n  \nfrom better_orderedmultidict import OrderedMultiDict\nomd: OrderedMultiDict[int, int] = OrderedMultiDict([(1,1), (2,2), (1,11), (2,22)])\n\nfor key in reversed(omd.unique_keys()):\n    print(f\"{key}: {omd.getall(key)}\")\n# prints:\n# 2: [2, 22]\n# 1: [1, 11]\n\nprint(omd.popfirstitem())  # prints: (1, 1)\nprint(omd.poplast(2))  # prints: 22\n\nfor key in reversed(omd.unique_keys()):\n    print(f\"{key}: {omd.getall(key)}\")\n# prints:\n# 2: [2]\n# 1: [11]\nInstallation\n\n    You can install Better-OrderedMultiDict using pip:\n  \npip install better-orderedmultidict\nContributing\n\n    If you have any suggestions or improvements for Better-OrderedMultiDict, feel free to submit a pull request or open an issue on the \nGitHub repository\n.

Thankfully, Ruff works out of the box, so no complicated installation instructions or configurations are needed to start using it.\n  \n\n    Assuming your project is already set up with a virtual environment, you can install Ruff in the following ways:\n  \n```bash\n$ python -m pip install ruff\n```\n\nYou can check that Ruff installed correctly by using the ruff version command:\n\n```bash\n$ ruff version\nruff 0.4.7\n```\nLinting Your Python Code\n\n    While linting helps keep your code consistent and error-free, it doesn’t guarantee that your code will be bug-free. Finding the bugs in your code is best handled with a debugger and adequate testing, which won’t be covered in this tutorial. Coming up in the next sections, you’ll learn how to use Ruff to check for errors and speed up your workflow.\n  \nChecking for Errors\n```bash\n$ ruff check\none_ring.py:1:8: F401 [*] `os` imported but unused\none_ring.py:10:12: F821 Undefined name `name`\nFound 2 errors.\n[*] 1 fixable with the `--fix` option.\n```\n\n    Success! Ruff found two errors. Not only does it show the file and line numbers of the errors, but it also gives you error codes and messages. In addition, it lets you know that one of the two errors is fixable. Great!\n  \n\n    You can tell Ruff to fix errors by applying the --fix flag. Here’s what happens when you follow its suggestion:\n  \n```bash\n$ ruff check --fix\none_ring.py:9:12: F821 Undefined name `name`\nFound 2 errors (1 fixed, 1 remaining).\n```\n\n    You can find the rest of this Free tutorial \nhere"},

The other day I remembered the game mentioned in the title and we had lots of fun playing it (there's 3 different games in this series). I decided I'd transfer the save file to my main PC so I can play when he's not visiting and I quickly learned it's an extremely annoying process to transfer save files across different PCs. Long story short, you need to find a proper registry key (which isn't always located at same spot for some reason) and you need to locate a system.dat file also located in a folder that isn't always in the same place. This process gets tedious pretty quick, so I decided to use the power of Python to make my life easier.\n  \n\n    What the project does:\n  \n\n    It's essentially a CLI save handler for the game mentioned in the title. It has 5 slots where you can backup your current save or load the backup to the computer. It can also fix minor registry issues if needed.\n  \n\n    Target audience:\n  \n\n    Given that I'm about 20 years too late... I'd say mostly people with very slow PCs or people who like to inhale nostalgia.\n  \n\n    I learned a lot about using winreg and msvcrt and getch, so while I will likely get bored of the game in the coming weeks, I'm happy I learned something new in the meantime, plus maybe someone finds it useful!\n  \n\n    Source code: \nmarkomavrinac/yugioh_poc_save_handler: Yu-Gi-Oh!

{"Title": "Introducing Temporal Adjusters: Simplify Time Series Adjustments in Python!", "Author": "u/MDTv_Teka", "Content": "Hey guys!\n  \n\n    I'm excited to introduce Temporal Adjusters, a new Python package designed to make time series adjustments easier and more efficient. If you work with time series data, you'll find this tool incredibly useful for various temporal adjustments.\n  \nWhat my project does\n\n    Adjusters are a key tool for modifying temporal objects. They exist to externalize the process of adjustment, permitting different approaches, as per the strategy design pattern. Temporal Adjuster provides tools that help pinpoint very specific moments in time, without having to manually count days, weeks, or months. In essence, a Temporal Adjuster is a function that encapsulates a specific date/time manipulation rule. It operates on a temporal object (representing a date, time, or datetime) to produce a new temporal object adjusted according to the rule. Examples might be an adjuster that sets the date avoiding weekends, or one that sets the date to the last day of the month.\n  \nInstallation\n\n    You can install Temporal Adjuster using pip:\n  \npip install temporal-adjuster\nUsage\n\n    This package provides a set of predefined temporal adjusters that can be used to adjust a temporal object in various ways. For example:\n  \n>>> from datetime import date, datetime\n\n>>> from temporal_adjuster import TemporalAdjuster\n>>> from temporal_adjuster.common.enums import Weekday\n\n>>> TemporalAdjuster.first_day_of_next_week(date(2021, 1, 1))\ndatetime.date(2021, 1, 4)\n\n>>> TemporalAdjuster.last_day_of_last_month(datetime(2021, 1, 1))\ndatetime.datetime(2020, 12, 31)\n\n>>> TemporalAdjuster.first_of_year(Weekday.SATURDAY, date(2021, 1, 1))\ndatetime.date(2021, 1, 2)\n\n>>> TemporalAdjuster.nth_of_month(Weekday.SUNDAY, datetime(2021, 5, 1), 2)\ndatetime.datetime(2021, 5, 9)\n\n>>> TemporalAdjuster.next(Weekday.MONDAY, datetime(2021, 2, 11), 2)\ndatetime.datetime(2021, 2, 15)\nContributing\n\n    If you have any suggestions or improvements for pynimbar, feel free to submit a pull request or open an issue on the \nGitHub repository\n as per the CONTRIBUTING document. We appreciate any feedback or contributions!\n  \nTarget audience\n\n    This can be used in production.

{"Title": "Perpetual - a self-generalizing, hyperparameter-free gradient boosting machine", "Author": "u/mutlu_simsek", "Content": "https://github.com/perpetual-ml/perpetual\n\n\nWhat My Project Does\n\n    PerpetualBooster is a gradient boosting machine (GBM) algorithm which doesn't have hyperparameters to be tuned so that you can use it without needing hyperparameter optimization packages unlike other GBM algorithms. Similar to AutoML libraries, it has a \nbudget\n parameter which ranges between \n(0, 1)\n. Increasing the \nbudget\n parameter increases predictive power of the algorithm and gives better results on unseen data. Start with a small budget and increase it once you are confident with your features. If you don't see any improvement with further increasing \nbudget\n, it means that you are already extracting the most predictive power out of your data.\n  \nTarget Audience\n\n    The project is meant for production.

Think freight train operations in unmapped depots bringing key merchandise from China to Europe. This was not something we could use Flink or Elastic for.\n  \n\n    Then we added more connectors for streaming ETL (Kafka, Postgres CDC…), data indexing (yay vectors!), and LLM wrappers for RAG. Today Pathway provides a data indexing layer for live data updates, stateless and stateful data transformations over streams, and retrieval of structured and unstructured data.\n  \n\n    Pathway ships with a Python API and a Rust runtime based on Differential Dataflow to perform incremental computation. All the pipeline is kept in memory and can be easily deployed with Docker and Kubernetes (pipelines-as-code).\n  \n\n    We built Pathway to support enterprises like F1 teams and processors of highly sensitive information to build mission-critical data pipelines. We do this by putting security and performance first. For example, you can build and deploy self-hosted RAG pipelines with local LLM models and Pathway’s in-memory vector index, so no data ever leaves your infrastructure. Pathway connectors and transformations work with live data by default, so you can avoid expensive reprocessing and rely on fresh data.\n  \n\n    You can install Pathway with pip and Docker, and get started with templates and notebooks:\n  \n\n\nhttps://pathway.com/developers/showcases\n\n\n\n    We also host demo RAG pipelines implemented 100% in Pathway, feel free to interact with their API endpoints:\n  \n\n\nhttps://pathway.com/solutions/rag-pipelines#try-it-out\n\n\n\n    We'd love to hear what you think of Pathway!"},

{"Title": "Sold my Python open source project to a San Francisco AI company. Now I work for them. AMA.", "Author": "u/romerio86", "Content": "About a year ago, I posted on this sub. I was terrified. I was launching a new framework. Another framework? Yes, I was crazy enough to think we needed yet another framework. Thankfully, the response was great. Many were excited to try it. Others were understandably skeptical, and respectfully asking good questions.\n  \n\n    This time, I'm posting for completely different reasons. I want to share a story. A story of which this sub, and hundreds of you, are part.\n  \n\n    It all started 2 years ago, when I was laid off from my analytics consulting job. I had a well-paying, comfortable job in the UK. Then I moved from the UK to Poland, where I live now, and continued working remotely. I was living the dream; earning a London salary while living in a place with a lower cost of living. Until it ended with a layoff.\n  \n\n    I thought, this is it. My career is dead. I didn't speak Polish properly, limiting my options. And finding another fully remote job working for the UK sounded overly optimistic at the time. Being in my mid 30s and with a family to support, I didn't want to start over again.\n  \n\n    I knew Python and data analytics quite well, and also had frontend skills I had gained throughout the years. So I thought... I need to show what I can do. I didn't have a portfolio at all; my GitHub was empty. After trying Streamlit, I thought the concept was great, but the execution wasn't. So I wrote an article on Medium, discussing how a better, faster alternative was possible. I also created a POC and shared it on GitHub.\n  \n\n    Thankfully, due to contacts at my previous job, I was able to find another remote job, working for the UK w. With even better pay. So naturally, I forgot about my portfolio-building efforts. But after a few months, an investor (VC) from Germany reached out to me. He had seen the Medium article and asked me whether I'd like to do this full time.\n  \n\n    I hesitated, but eventually decided to explore this further. I didn't need any investment though; my idea was quite simple. And to be honest, not too different from other frameworks, just faster. I had to think bigger. One day, at London Stansted Airport, while waiting to board a plane home, I decided to go for it and came up with the idea of no-code in the front, Python in the back. In other words, building the frontend using a visual editor, while allowing for full freedom in the backend using Python, and abstracting all the connectivity between.\n  \n\n    The VC liked the idea, but wasn't fully convinced about my ability to execute. He decided not to invest. But since I liked the idea and thought it could go somewhere, I decided to try building it myself, at night, after work. For 9 months, that was my reality. Nights, weekends. If my baby son would wake up, early mornings too.\n  \n\n    In May 2023, I managed to get the framework to a state I was happy with, and launched it. The response was very good. I eventually got to 1000 stars on GitHub, a milestone for any open source project. To a great extent, thanks to the support of communities such as \nr/python\n and \nr/opensource\n. Also, thanks to sites like Medium and Product Hunt.\n  \n\n    A few months later, in November 2023, the CTO of a multibillion AI company reached out to me. They wanted to acquire my framework, hire me, and build a team for me to continue developing it. I was ecstatic. He told me he'd go on a Thanksgiving break for a few days and that he'd reach out to me after. He never got back to me. Accepting that this wasn't going to happen was tough.\n  \n\n    Two weeks later, the CTO of another AI company called me, together with the CEO. They also wanted to acquire me and make me a part of their team. A smaller company, much more interesting and already quite established, with clients such as Accenture and Salesforce. But with grit and determination to win in the space of enterprise generative AI. This time, it did work out and my framework was finally acquired. Now I work for them and I lead a team focused on maintaining this open source project. \n  \n\n    Happy to answer any questions.

{"Title": "Introducing Temporal Adjusters: Simplify Time Series Adjustments in Python!", "Author": "u/MDTv_Teka", "Content": "Hey guys!\n  \n\n    I'm excited to introduce Temporal Adjusters, a new Python package designed to make time series adjustments easier and more efficient. If you work with time series data, you'll find this tool incredibly useful for various temporal adjustments.\n  \nWhat my project does\n\n    Adjusters are a key tool for modifying temporal objects. They exist to externalize the process of adjustment, permitting different approaches, as per the strategy design pattern. Temporal Adjuster provides tools that help pinpoint very specific moments in time, without having to manually count days, weeks, or months. In essence, a Temporal Adjuster is a function that encapsulates a specific date/time manipulation rule. It operates on a temporal object (representing a date, time, or datetime) to produce a new temporal object adjusted according to the rule. Examples might be an adjuster that sets the date avoiding weekends, or one that sets the date to the last day of the month.\n  \nInstallation\n\n    You can install Temporal Adjuster using pip:\n  \npip install temporal-adjuster\nUsage\n\n    This package provides a set of predefined temporal adjusters that can be used to adjust a temporal object in various ways. For example:\n  \n>>> from datetime import date, datetime\n\n>>> from temporal_adjuster import TemporalAdjuster\n>>> from temporal_adjuster.common.enums import Weekday\n\n>>> TemporalAdjuster.first_day_of_next_week(date(2021, 1, 1))\ndatetime.date(2021, 1, 4)\n\n>>> TemporalAdjuster.last_day_of_last_month(datetime(2021, 1, 1))\ndatetime.datetime(2020, 12, 31)\n\n>>> TemporalAdjuster.first_of_year(Weekday.SATURDAY, date(2021, 1, 1))\ndatetime.date(2021, 1, 2)\n\n>>> TemporalAdjuster.nth_of_month(Weekday.SUNDAY, datetime(2021, 5, 1), 2)\ndatetime.datetime(2021, 5, 9)\n\n>>> TemporalAdjuster.next(Weekday.MONDAY, datetime(2021, 2, 11), 2)\ndatetime.datetime(2021, 2, 15)\nContributing\n\n    If you have any suggestions or improvements for pynimbar, feel free to submit a pull request or open an issue on the \nGitHub repository\n as per the CONTRIBUTING document. We appreciate any feedback or contributions!\n  \nTarget audience\n\n    This can be used in production. It has only one depedency, dateutils, which if you're manipulating temporal objects you probably already have. All the code is 100% unit-tested, as well as build tested for all supported Python versions.\n  \nComparison\n\n    This is based on Java's native TemporalAdjuster interfaces, but I found no similar library/functionality for Python."},

{"Title": "Perpetual - a self-generalizing, hyperparameter-free gradient boosting machine", "Author": "u/mutlu_simsek", "Content": "https://github.com/perpetual-ml/perpetual\n\n\nWhat My Project Does\n\n    PerpetualBooster is a gradient boosting machine (GBM) algorithm which doesn't have hyperparameters to be tuned so that you can use it without needing hyperparameter optimization packages unlike other GBM algorithms. Similar to AutoML libraries, it has a \nbudget\n parameter which ranges between \n(0, 1)\n. Increasing the \nbudget\n parameter increases predictive power of the algorithm and gives better results on unseen data. Start with a small budget and increase it once you are confident with your features. If you don't see any improvement with further increasing \nbudget\n, it means that you are already extracting the most predictive power out of your data.\n  \nTarget Audience\n\n    The project is meant for production. You can replace hyperparameter packages plus other gradient boosting algorithms with PerpetualBooster.\n  \nComparison\n\n    Other gradient boosting algorithms (XGBoost, LightGBM, Catboost) and most of the machine learning algorithms need hyperparameter optimization for the best performance on unseen data.

Think freight train operations in unmapped depots bringing key merchandise from China to Europe. This was not something we could use Flink or Elastic for.\n  \n\n    Then we added more connectors for streaming ETL (Kafka, Postgres CDC…), data indexing (yay vectors!), and LLM wrappers for RAG. Today Pathway provides a data indexing layer for live data updates, stateless and stateful data transformations over streams, and retrieval of structured and unstructured data.\n  \n\n    Pathway ships with a Python API and a Rust runtime based on Differential Dataflow to perform incremental computation. All the pipeline is kept in memory and can be easily deployed with Docker and Kubernetes (pipelines-as-code).\n  \n\n    We built Pathway to support enterprises like F1 teams and processors of highly sensitive information to build mission-critical data pipelines. We do this by putting security and performance first. For example, you can build and deploy self-hosted RAG pipelines with local LLM models and Pathway’s in-memory vector index, so no data ever leaves your infrastructure. Pathway connectors and transformations work with live data by default, so you can avoid expensive reprocessing and rely on fresh data.\n  \n\n    You can install Pathway with pip and Docker, and get started with templates and notebooks:\n  \n\n\nhttps://pathway.com/developers/showcases\n\n\n\n    We also host demo RAG pipelines implemented 100% in Pathway, feel free to interact with their API endpoints:\n  \n\n\nhttps://pathway.com/solutions/rag-pipelines#try-it-out\n\n\n\n    We'd love to hear what you think of Pathway!"},

{"Title": "Sold my Python open source project to a San Francisco AI company. Now I work for them. AMA.", "Author": "u/romerio86", "Content": "About a year ago, I posted on this sub. I was terrified. I was launching a new framework. Another framework? Yes, I was crazy enough to think we needed yet another framework. Thankfully, the response was great. Many were excited to try it. Others were understandably skeptical, and respectfully asking good questions.\n  \n\n    This time, I'm posting for completely different reasons. I want to share a story. A story of which this sub, and hundreds of you, are part.\n  \n\n    It all started 2 years ago, when I was laid off from my analytics consulting job. I had a well-paying, comfortable job in the UK. Then I moved from the UK to Poland, where I live now, and continued working remotely. I was living the dream; earning a London salary while living in a place with a lower cost of living. Until it ended with a layoff.\n  \n\n    I thought, this is it. My career is dead. I didn't speak Polish properly, limiting my options. And finding another fully remote job working for the UK sounded overly optimistic at the time. Being in my mid 30s and with a family to support, I didn't want to start over again.\n  \n\n    I knew Python and data analytics quite well, and also had frontend skills I had gained throughout the years. So I thought... I need to show what I can do. I didn't have a portfolio at all; my GitHub was empty. After trying Streamlit, I thought the concept was great, but the execution wasn't. So I wrote an article on Medium, discussing how a better, faster alternative was possible. I also created a POC and shared it on GitHub.\n  \n\n    Thankfully, due to contacts at my previous job, I was able to find another remote job, working for the UK w. With even better pay. So naturally, I forgot about my portfolio-building efforts. But after a few months, an investor (VC) from Germany reached out to me. He had seen the Medium article and asked me whether I'd like to do this full time.\n  \n\n    I hesitated, but eventually decided to explore this further. I didn't need any investment though; my idea was quite simple. And to be honest, not too different from other frameworks, just faster. I had to think bigger. One day, at London Stansted Airport, while waiting to board a plane home, I decided to go for it and came up with the idea of no-code in the front, Python in the back. In other words, building the frontend using a visual editor, while allowing for full freedom in the backend using Python, and abstracting all the connectivity between.\n  \n\n    The VC liked the idea, but wasn't fully convinced about my ability to execute. He decided not to invest. But since I liked the idea and thought it could go somewhere, I decided to try building it myself, at night, after work. For 9 months, that was my reality. Nights, weekends. If my baby son would wake up, early mornings too.\n  \n\n    In May 2023, I managed to get the framework to a state I was happy with, and launched it. The response was very good. I eventually got to 1000 stars on GitHub, a milestone for any open source project. To a great extent, thanks to the support of communities such as \nr/python\n and \nr/opensource\n. Also, thanks to sites like Medium and Product Hunt.\n  \n\n    A few months later, in November 2023, the CTO of a multibillion AI company reached out to me. They wanted to acquire my framework, hire me, and build a team for me to continue developing it. I was ecstatic. He told me he'd go on a Thanksgiving break for a few days and that he'd reach out to me after. He never got back to me. Accepting that this wasn't going to happen was tough.\n  \n\n    Two weeks later, the CTO of another AI company called me, together with the CEO. They also wanted to acquire me and make me a part of their team. A smaller company, much more interesting and already quite established, with clients such as Accenture and Salesforce. But with grit and determination to win in the space of enterprise generative AI. This time, it did work out and my framework was finally acquired. Now I work for them and I lead a team focused on maintaining this open source project. \n  \n\n    Happy to answer any questions.

Source is available here: \nhttps://github.com/rmblau/textchat/\n\n\n\n    I would love any and all feedback on code quality and how it can be improved as well as people to test out the client. On first launch it will open a settings screen where you can input your user information once you hit the save button. Right now there's a bug that I'm working on resolving where that you'll have to quit the application once you enter your information and relaunch it to get it to connect. Feel free to file issues and contribute; I hope you all will find this fun and interesting!\n  \nWhat My Project Does\n\n    Only confirmed working on Linux right now.. Right now it does not support SASL, SSL, or znc. It's in alpha and can be installed from pypi. Once installed it can be ran from the cmd line with `textchat`\n  \nTarget Audience\n\n    This is aimed at people who love irc as much as I do.\n  \nComparison\n\n    There didn't seem to be any application like this so I decided to make it."},

If one of these tests fails, I need to spend ~20 seconds to find the right file, open it in neovim, and find the right test function. 20 seconds might not sound like much, but trying not to fat-finger paths in the terminal for this amount of time makes my blood boil.\n  \n\n    I wanted Pytest to do this for me, thought there would be a plugin for it. Google brought up no results, so I asked ChatGPT. It said there's a \npytest-edit\n plugin that adds an \n--edit\n option to Pytest.\n  \n\n    There isn't. So I created just that. Enjoy. \nhttps://github.com/MrMino/pytest-edit\n\n\n\n    Now, my issue is that I don't know if it works on Windows/Mac with VS Code / PyCharm, etc. - so if anyone would like to spend some time on betatesting a small pytest plugin - issue reports & PRs very much welcome.\n  \nWhat My Project Does\n\n    It adds an \n--edit\n option to Pytest, that opens failing test code in the user's editor of choice.\n  \nTarget Audience\n\n    Pytest users.\n  \nComparison\n\n    AFAIK nothing like this on the market, but I hope I'm wrong.\nThink \n%edit\n magic from IPython but for failed pytest executions."},
