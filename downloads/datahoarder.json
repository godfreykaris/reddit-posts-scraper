You could get a 2 drive or 4 drive enclosure, depending on how much physical space you have for your offsite backup. So mitigate cost of redundancy, I've had great success with buying the samsung evo geek squad drives from bestbuy, they always have low mileage and are super reliable.\nAlternatively you could look into getting the corsair survivor USB drives, they go all the way up to 1tb now. I keep one of those in my car and update it every month or so, the durability of it is very appealing (not sure where you are storing your offsite backup)\njust my 2 cents",

Now and then I remove stuff from the messy hoard and fix it up and put it in the nice hoard. \nThings like movies and TV is easy, using the tools I mentioned. There is nothing at all of that in the messy hoard. Most of the messy hoard consists of audiobooks and ebooks. I run a hardlinker on it, to combine duplicates. Hadori. \nFor backups I use rsync with the link dest feature. It means that every backup (almost) only store new and modified files, and hardlinks to files that were already backed up in the previous backup. A simple form of file level deduplication. \nI store the nice hoard in a mergerfs and snapraid pool. Snapraid means that I can detect and fix errors or mistaken deletes or changes. \nThe most important media, personal stuff like photos, scanned photo albums, source code, documents and various projects are also backed up remotely in compressed archives with checksums.\nThe nice hoard grows faster based on size. The messy hoard grows faster based on number of media files. Fortunately the media files in the messy hoard are relatively small. Now and then I do extractions and delete duplicates. For example all books and audiobooks by some specific author. But the messy hoard grows faster than I can reduce it. That is why I am a data hoarder rather than a data curator.",

You could also try something like RAID 50 or 60, where you have a two RAID 5/6 arrays in a striped array to help with throughput, but not all raid systems support that.\nYou'll also need to consider which filesystem you are going to use. I'd be hesitant to use something write-heavy like btrfs since it does copy-on-write.\nThat's just my opinion though, I run 4x18TB in RAID 5 with btrfs, someone with more experience in different RAID setups may know more.",

To get a solution that will be something worthwhile and meets your requirements, you will likely need to change how you are storing data.\nI know you are anti-RAID right now, but consider unraid as an option (NO, IT ISN'T RAID). Say you have 5 drives + 1 parity drive in unraid, and you want to write some new data; only the drive and the parity being written too will need to be spun up; all the others will remain spun down. As soon as the drives have no activity the length of time entered in disk settings, they will also spin down. For reading it is even less, ONLY the required drive will spin up, the rest remain off. This would solve your drive power concerns. You WILL have to move from NTFS, not sure why you are caught up on that, but it isn't supported. As well, your system will have less overhead saving you even more in power cost vs a windows instance.\nIf you want no parity drive, then fine, you can run without one, but IMO, that is just asking for more trouble. Why not invest in the single digit watts required to run an additional drive for some parity protection? Do your Backblaze and multiple saves all you want, it still gives you additional protection for almost nothing in electricity.",

This pad is hot any time the box is plugged in.\nThe SV is setup to connect the pin to ground with a few seconds delay after plugin, which ends up with the box booting about 10 seconds after.\nIn theory, with a 40 pin breakout connector and some more work, you could get full status information back from the ribbon cable. Fan status, disk IO status, power saving, and button presses could all be tapped though I'm not sure what voltage everything is operating at.

You could also try something like RAID 50 or 60, where you have a two RAID 5/6 arrays in a striped array to help with throughput, but not all raid systems support that.\nYou'll also need to consider which filesystem you are going to use.

For one you cannot really play a lot of games without transferring them onto your PC first and doing so can take a while over 1Gbit networking, even longer over Wifi.\n\"Doing a backup once in a while\" is a surefire way to pay for a backup without having one. You might do it once a month, but after a while you will forget to do it, then you are a business trip, vacation, then your get gets sick, you have to do some crunch time at work and boom your backup is half a year old, does not include the pictures of your recent vacation and the important documents you filed recently. For this reason, most backups should be rather frequent and automated.",

There is even a Wikipedia article about it.\nAnother issue is all the work and money you have to put into this. You have to get a drive, all those discs, then burn all those discs, then manage them, and then recheck them regular. It still can make sense as a cold backup for your most important stuff, but should most definitely not be the only way you store your less accessed stuff and is kinda a pain at a larger scale.",

The drives are pooled using mergerfs. I also have snapraid pool for static/archived files. No RAID at all. (I have an old Synology NAS with RAID for remote cold storage.) Using mergerfs it is easy to expand the storage, simply add another drive, of any size, to the pool. I have no unused drive bays left, so I expand by replacing failing drives with bigger drives. Currently I have a mix of 16TB and 18TB Seagate Exos drives. I currently don't want any more drives, only bigger...\nI use rsync, with the link dest feature, for timestamped versioned snapshot style backups. This is a very simple form of backups with file level deduplication. Each backup only (almost) store new and modified files since last backup. Files already in the previous backup are simply hardlinked. This means I have storage for many, many backups. And each backup is fast. \nEach backup looks just like the source filesystem, at the time of the backup. So recovery is very easy. Just copy the files. No special file format. No compression. No encryption. Just hardlinks between backups, of files that are the same in each backup.\nYou could use one drive for storage and the other for backups.\nI have my DAS directly connected to my PC. Ubuntu MATE. So performance with 10Gbps USB is much better than 1Gbps ethernet. The DAS are also shared over the network. I use Emby and can stream 4K remux video over my WiFi-6 network.",

For the newer/more advanced file systems like btrfs or zfs I think there aren't even tools to do that (or at least not too common, it's \"restore from backups\" clearly). Oh, and in case it isn't a very known thing - hard drives actually have their own OS and the largest part of it comes from the platters itself. This is why when you have mechanical damage you can't still see SMART or anything, the hard drive itself doesn't come up, one bad sector can probably nuke the whole drive anyway.\nAs far as generic reliability and \"encryption bad\" fear people have I'd think we should just get over it. Phones/tablets are encrypted by default (and since a veeeery long time, before 2015 or so, Android since Android 5 and iOS since earlier) and Windows (even Windows 10) would enable bitlocker on the OS disk since quite a few years (assuming some requirements are met, but they are for really mostly everything sold in the last 5 years or more).",

To get a solution that will be something worthwhile and meets your requirements, you will likely need to change how you are storing data.\nI know you are anti-RAID right now, but consider unraid as an option (NO, IT ISN'T RAID). Say you have 5 drives + 1 parity drive in unraid, and you want to write some new data; only the drive and the parity being written too will need to be spun up; all the others will remain spun down. As soon as the drives have no activity the length of time entered in disk settings, they will also spin down. For reading it is even less, ONLY the required drive will spin up, the rest remain off. This would solve your drive power concerns. You WILL have to move from NTFS, not sure why you are caught up on that, but it isn't supported. As well, your system will have less overhead saving you even more in power cost vs a windows instance.\nIf you want no parity drive, then fine, you can run without one, but IMO, that is just asking for more trouble. Why not invest in the single digit watts required to run an additional drive for some parity protection? Do your Backblaze and multiple saves all you want, it still gives you additional protection for almost nothing in electricity.",

Our IT department is extremely capable but also have their own budget and workload to deal with and we have been told that a local \" in office\" solution would be the only way to get what we need right now. Our current network drives are allotted per department ( and we are piggy backed off another department) and are backed up locally twice a day and then backed up off site to 3 other sites every day. And yes I can and already am the person to manage things but that doesn't set the department up for future success.

Without one, most capture devices delete corrupted frames in a really bad way where they just get deleted instead of showing snow or the previous one. This makes the video slowly fall out of sync with the audio and it's almost impossible to fix. Using a TBC is like playing the tape on a CRT and pointing a camera at it to get a new clean signal. The best options are a full-frame one connected with S-Video, or the free software one built into vhs-decode which also supports Hi8. Once you have a raw capture file that was cleaned up by a TBC, you can de-interlace it with QTGMC to make it 50/60 fps like it would be on a CRT. I wrote a long comment about how to do it with the highest quality.\nglitches that show half of other frame\nThis is an interlacing issue. Some people think of interlacing as 25 or 29.97 fps but it was actually shown as 50 or 59.94 fps on CRT's because (at least for camcorder tapes) the fields were taken at different times instead of being halves of the same frame, and they were not shown together at the same time on CRT's.",

Using gloves, if you can take the tape off, run it between your fingers, and it not stick to your fingers or have cracks, you should be safe to try it in in a drive.",

I've been burned before... and rather then save $20 on an enclosure with a chip tested on larger drives (12-14-16-18-20-22tb if that's what you mean)...\nI'd spend the $20.\nAt least if it wasn't just a 5th backup of something I didn't care about and was shucking around town kinda thing...\nunless I'm misunderstanding something here...",

Short-term storage is considered to be months, whereas long-term storage is the full life of the tape, 30 years.\nThese tapes should be fine if they didn't exceed the environmental parameters for shipping. I would check the high and low temperatures for the day as well as humidities, and make sure it absolutely did not rain. Consider that the color of the tape might mean that that the tape temperature got higher than the ambient temperature.\nI agree with running a cleaning tape though, outdoors is dusty and dirty and you don't know exactly the condition of the internals. If you want to be safe, the only way to know for sure is to open them\nEdit: Missed that they were inside. They should be fine, the temperature shouldn't have gone that much above ambient even if ambient was 33° C, but again I would suggest opening them and inspecting to be safe - just be very careful that you don't let the spring come loose or you'll be forced to send the exploded remains of the tape to data recovery services.",

It is already on Windows so you won't have to install anything. You can make a .bat file with the command you want and run it whenever you want to backup, or use task scheduler to do it automatically. There's a few YouTube videos that have good examples.\nHere is the code I used to mirror my M: drive onto my R: drive and create a text log. The mirror command will only copy new items that are missing on the destination, but be careful because if you switch the source and destination you could wipe all your data.

If you need to maintain hardlinks I would check out ln.exe: https://schinagl.priv.at/nt/ln/ln.html.

I use a 55 inch OLED and I sit pretty close to the TV.\nI disable upscaling in the DVD/Blu-ray player, as I find the upscaling the TV does is better. This goes for every combination of TV and player I have tested. Outputting in the original 480i/576i interlaced format from the player helps a lot, so the TV does deinterlacing and upscaling at the same time. Not all players have this option unfortunately.\nPlaying from a computer is a little different, then you cant output an interlaced signal.\nIf you get awful results when ripping a DVD, make sure you’re not re-encoding it. If you keep it in the raw original MPEG-2 format you don’t lose anything. Any extra compression will degrade the quality. The worst is if the transcoder gets the deinterlacing wrong, it will produce really awful artifacts in the picture.",

Without one, most capture devices delete corrupted frames in a really bad way where they just get deleted instead of showing snow or the previous one. This makes the video slowly fall out of sync with the audio and it's almost impossible to fix. Using a TBC is like playing the tape on a CRT and pointing a camera at it to get a new clean signal. The best options are a full-frame one connected with S-Video, or the free software one built into vhs-decode which also supports Hi8. Once you have a raw capture file that was cleaned up by a TBC, you can de-interlace it with QTGMC to make it 50/60 fps like it would be on a CRT. I wrote a long comment about how to do it with the highest quality.\nglitches that show half of other frame\nThis is an interlacing issue. Some people think of interlacing as 25 or 29.97 fps but it was actually shown as 50 or 59.94 fps on CRT's because (at least for camcorder tapes) the fields were taken at different times instead of being halves of the same frame, and they were not shown together at the same time on CRT's.",

Typical controllers support 1k or more drives.\nI wouldn't go option 2 with truenas if you want to drop in servers not disk shelves you need a scale wide solution truenas is not that. Add disk shelves to this is a good option.\nDS4246 they are not great but they are cheap if you want 24 LFF bays why not get a server with 24 LFF bays, cheaper than buying 2 boxes. You can always add disk shelves later. Would call these guys the starter phase in a large setup not the finial.\nYou need to pick a raid type. ZFS is popular around here it's big downside it it's not flexible, you need to add things in a unit of drives. I don't think you need much performance but starting with say 10 disks in a Z2. Outside the CCTV storage something more flexible like snapraid/unraid.\nCitrix xen, that's an oldie but a goody. If you want to do something hyper converged at home proxmox could be a better fit. If you're looking for something more user friendly here is a gui unraid can do that job. The whole plex stack is dockerized at this point.\nPower usage does this matter to you? I've running 3/4PB on a i3 for plex etc because the power consumption of a couple xeons was awful. Because I'm in a supermicro chassis I could use standard motherboards vs the dell proprietary. Plex really likes intel igpu's for transcoding otherwise you're dropping in a big nvidia card again more power used. Since your doing plex and NVR consider what environments your thinking and how you can get GPU's into them.\nI would look at a supermicro 36 bay case that's like 100-200 bucks more than the netapp shelf. But it fits a standard motherboard while holding 50% more drives in roughly the same space. Thats 480TB or so usable with 6 bays left over for hot swap assuming 3x 10 22tb drive Z2.",

Make sure what you get has a PCI card slot so you can add a video card or maybe your just planning on having a separate Plex box. I will say this if you have a second Plex box all your media gets streamed on your network twice. Once to the Plex box and then to it's destination, not a problem if you segregate your network but if this is all on one switch / router it's double the traffic. Something to keep in mind if your going to have a lot of simultaneous streams.",

If they're MJPEG, using a normal lossless codec would make them bigger so you would need to use one that can losslessly re-compress JPEG files. JPEG XL can re-compress JPEG files to about 85% but it's incredibly slow (like 1 minute or more per frame) and you'd have to find a way to get the frames from the video without decoding them, compress them, and store them in a single file. If they're anything else, I don't think there's a lossless way to compress them and make them smaller. If you can't re-compress them then my advice is to buy another drive. 4 TB isn't much.\nFor my tapes, I capture as direct head RF and compress it with FLAC and \"--lax -11Vepl32\" which gets it to around 67 GiB/hour. You didn't say how long your tapes are but if they're 2 hours each then that's about the same size which isn't bad. I prefer my method because it stores noticeably higher quality than a conventional composite capture for about the same amount of data.",

There is a lens involved after all.\nAnything affecting the long edge is likely a mechanical issue. This could be a faulty stepper motor, worn gears/teeth, bad rails, or a bad belt. Anything interfering with it gliding smoothly and predictably under the print.\nFor most users a 1-2% error should be fine as long as it remains consistent. Lens issues for the most part they should be consistent but mechanical issues can be unpredictable and random.\nYour typical shitty machines like printers won't be consistent in either dimension.\nIt's very common for them to have issues affecting the long edge due to mechanical issues which can be very bad causing issues viewing their images even at a glance. For CCD machines their optical designs will vary and some will be better than others but none will be 100% perfect. For CIS machines most have gaps between the sensor modules that cause issues in scans and a lot of them are 5% or more out of spec regarding the DPI which is pretty crazy considering they don't use a lens like CCD ones do.\nIf you're using a decent CCD scanner and finding things are chaotic, you're probably using it wrong.\nThe V600 should be decent and good enough to not have to scan things multiple times rotated for stacking or anything, so I'm not sure why you're stacking images. Is it just for testing?\nIf you want more predictable scans be sure to always use the center of the glass. This will use the center of the lens instead of the edges, and most importantly it will ensure you're using the same part of the lens. If you scanning something in a corner then you scan it in the middle I would not be surprised if they don't stack perfectly. If you're a degree off in placement and rotating to align two separate scans from different areas on the glass I'd expect that to work out even worse. These may be things that the more expensive V850 does better at but I don't know. I would probably bet against it and consider 1-2% to be acceptable and part of the design. The more expensive A3 Expression machines might even be worse due to having a larger bed and the whole autofocus system. On all CCD based machines without mechanical flaws affecting the long axis I would expect the center part of the glass to yield consistent results with the lowest distortion.\nIn my experience I have not had any significant issues with my V600. I have noticed this behavior but have not found it to really be a problem. In my case the ratio appears accurate to <1% or so at least in the center and I have not had serious issues with the mechanical side. If I leave something on the glass and run multiple scans, the images stack well. In comparison, with shitty machines like printers the issues caused by mechanical flaws were visually bad, not just measurable. If I move things around the glass on the V600 between scans and then try to stack, that is a problem but I don't ever need to do that. It is a little disappointing that we can't have perfection but even with its flaws it seems close enough for me for the price.",

One HDD is fine but when you run a bunch of them it gets pretty noisy.\nYes, a NAS should work well for you but keep in mind that it might not work all that well for games. For one you cannot really play a lot of games without transferring them onto your PC first and doing so can take a while over 1Gbit networking, even longer over Wifi.\n\"Doing a backup once in a while\" is a surefire way to pay for a backup without having one. You might do it once a month, but after a while you will forget to do it, then you are a business trip, vacation, then your get gets sick, you have to do some crunch time at work and boom your backup is half a year old, does not include the pictures of your recent vacation and the important documents you filed recently. For this reason, most backups should be rather frequent and automated.\nQNAP does have the better hardware and is cheaper but I still think Synology is worth the premium. Their track record in terms of security and long term update support is pretty stellar and the software is pretty nice.\nIf your device can direct play your stuff you are fine pretty much no matter what NAS you use. Just make sure you get something that has docker support. You might consider getting an N100 Mini PC for ~$130 as a dedicated Plex server. It really sucks that Synology moved to Ryzen as their lack of iGPUs make them ill suited for Plex servers.",

I don't know if its the same for the R6 but make sure to screw in the HDD sleds to the case from both sides.\nAs for the Seagate drives, the x24 is newer than the x22 which is newer than the x20 and so on. None of them are notably louder or quieter.",

Held all media, user files, single Docker container. That NAS is powered off just under a week now.\nSynology RS1619xs+ with expansion unit. 12 x 14TB. This is my NAS for VMware virtual machines. About 100 of them, most not powered on. This machine also has backups of user files and some media, about 11TB in backups total.\nSynology RS2418RP+. 8 x 18TB. This NAS replaced the DS3615xs and has all user files and media on it. Runs backups and contains Veeam backup repositories. Also some VM replicas.\nSynology DS1010+ with expansion unit. 10 x 6TB. My oldest NAS. 14 years. In a powered-off state, it is powered on occasionally and contains a copy of about half the media, err... Linux ISOs...\nHomebuilt TrueNAS SCALE machine. 5 x 18TB. In a powered-off state, it is also powered on occasionally and also contains a copy of about half the Linux ISOs I own. Every time this machine is updated there are new issues. Not hardware related. Ahem.\nRobocopy batch files keep those last two NASes in sync when powered on.\nSynology DS220+. 2 x 12TB. This is the only Synology NAS that I own that supports WORM/immutable storage with which I am experimenting. No production data on this NAS. Yet.\nNew: UGREEN all-flash DXP480T Plus. 2 x 2TB. Nice device and attractively priced on Kickstarter. No particular use. In a powered-off state for now.\nSo, in summary, the two big rack NASes are both housing data, whether it be user data, media, or virtual machines. One backs up the other as much as practical.\nTwo powered-off NASes have copies of all media not otherwise on the two RackStations. Linux ISOs.\nThe NASes that are usually powered off are plugged into smart outlets so they draw no power when not in use.\nMaybe this will give you some ideas?",

I don't remember off the top of my head which cases have what, but they have everything from ITX to ATX (unsure about EATX compatibility) with hotswap.\nAlthough honestly I question the value of hotswap in a home environment. I got the fractal meshify 2 a week ago, no complaints so far. Its basically the same as the Define 7 but with a mesh front panel. I was worried about HDD noise but apparently the vibration dampening thingies on the HDD sleds work surprisingly well, and my old case was just kinda shit",

To download them the legitimate way. i basically scraped the tracks links (i ended up with with over 350K total) and then compiled those into a spreadsheet, i had to add a prefix and suffix to add the html needed to complete the button action. then exported the formatted links as a bookmark file. by opening one of these links, a click on the blue \"pull\" button registers, the page redirects to some backend, and now that track is added to your profile, you can open hundreds at a time this way, as long as the page loads and the redirect is completed, you can quickly add projects. The desktop client app then starts downloading anything registered as \"pulled\" in small chunks, kinda like bittorrent does. its insanely slow and often stops syncing for unknown reasons... the site was just too slow (at least on my connection) to get anywhere meaningful this way. I can provide my files i created and instructions on how to perform this if needed.",

Especially if you're trying to cram that board into a Jonsbo case, stick with the lower TDP chips. You'll have an easier time keeping it cool.\nJellyfin support is pretty decent, assuming you follow the docs and have an up-to-date kernel that supports the card (read as: 6.2 or newer).\nA380 runs well, and handles transcoding streams with the fan barely kicking up. That being said, if you've already got a bit of a stash, and are trying to transcode it to AV1 for storage reasons, it can really only handle about 3-4 4k H265-to-AV1 streams at once (as me how I know ;w;). Assuming you use the Jellyfin client though, you should be able to direct-stream the file 98% of the time, and the A380 will only get used for down-res or lowering bitrate.\nComing from a 2070Super, I'm a LOT happier with the A380, and my power bill is a chunk lower too.\n.....

The only time the over-provisioning area would get smaller is when an in-use memory block fails (in addition, if a block in the over-provisioning area fails reclassify it as a used block that failed). If anyone has any documentation on WTF happens in the over-provisioning area (so I don't have to speculate), hook me up but I suspect it's considered trade secret.",

If they're MJPEG, using a normal lossless codec would make them bigger so you would need to use one that can losslessly re-compress JPEG files. JPEG XL can re-compress JPEG files to about 85% but it's incredibly slow (like 1 minute or more per frame) and you'd have to find a way to get the frames from the video without decoding them, compress them, and store them in a single file. If they're anything else, I don't think there's a lossless way to compress them and make them smaller. If you can't re-compress them then my advice is to buy another drive. 4 TB isn't much.\nFor my tapes, I capture as direct head RF and compress it with FLAC and \"--lax -11Vepl32\" which gets it to around 67 GiB/hour. You didn't say how long your tapes are but if they're 2 hours each then that's about the same size which isn't bad.

There is a lens involved after all.\nAnything affecting the long edge is likely a mechanical issue. This could be a faulty stepper motor, worn gears/teeth, bad rails, or a bad belt. Anything interfering with it gliding smoothly and predictably under the print.\nFor most users a 1-2% error should be fine as long as it remains consistent. Lens issues for the most part they should be consistent but mechanical issues can be unpredictable and random.\nYour typical shitty machines like printers won't be consistent in either dimension.\nIt's very common for them to have issues affecting the long edge due to mechanical issues which can be very bad causing issues viewing their images even at a glance. For CCD machines their optical designs will vary and some will be better than others but none will be 100% perfect. For CIS machines most have gaps between the sensor modules that cause issues in scans and a lot of them are 5% or more out of spec regarding the DPI which is pretty crazy considering they don't use a lens like CCD ones do.\nIf you're using a decent CCD scanner and finding things are chaotic, you're probably using it wrong.\nThe V600 should be decent and good enough to not have to scan things multiple times rotated for stacking or anything, so I'm not sure why you're stacking images. Is it just for testing?\nIf you want more predictable scans be sure to always use the center of the glass. This will use the center of the lens instead of the edges, and most importantly it will ensure you're using the same part of the lens. If you scanning something in a corner then you scan it in the middle I would not be surprised if they don't stack perfectly. If you're a degree off in placement and rotating to align two separate scans from different areas on the glass I'd expect that to work out even worse. These may be things that the more expensive V850 does better at but I don't know. I would probably bet against it and consider 1-2% to be acceptable and part of the design. The more expensive A3 Expression machines might even be worse due to having a larger bed and the whole autofocus system. On all CCD based machines without mechanical flaws affecting the long axis I would expect the center part of the glass to yield consistent results with the lowest distortion.\nIn my experience I have not had any significant issues with my V600. I have noticed this behavior but have not found it to really be a problem. In my case the ratio appears accurate to <1% or so at least in the center and I have not had serious issues with the mechanical side. If I leave something on the glass and run multiple scans, the images stack well. In comparison, with shitty machines like printers the issues caused by mechanical flaws were visually bad, not just measurable. If I move things around the glass on the V600 between scans and then try to stack, that is a problem but I don't ever need to do that. It is a little disappointing that we can't have perfection but even with its flaws it seems close enough for me for the price.",

You can get 2 4TB HDDs for less than a single 4TB SSD and it will be much less likely that both of them fail at once compared to a single SSD.\nYou are very unlikely to find actual data on how reliable those drives are. Someone would have to buy like 10-20,000 of each and run them in a controlled environment for like a decade to get decent data. Ideally 10x that to cover different environments. So all you will find is anecdotal evidence.\nSome drives have some design flaws that will kill a lot of drives prematurely like some of the drives Sandisk makes. And Samsung had a bunch of firmware issues over the years. However, keep in mind that those drives are build to meant a certain price point and Q&A can only do so much so some infant mortality is to be expected, on top of external factors. So while it is less likely for a brand new drive to fail than for a very old one, any drive can still fail at any time. This is why you have backups.\nDo not hunt for the \"golden drive\". Especially for backup drives stuff like performance, thermal issues and the like are often far less relevant than for your main drive. \"Whatever is on sale right now\" is usually good enough.",

The difference was quite noticeable.\nAlso, as you said, changing the placement of the photograph on the scanner glass changes the scan a bit, like faces are thinner in a spot, but fatter in another one.\nI'd like to post some examples, but I'd prefer not to do so for privacy reasons.\nAt first I thought it was a print flatness problem. But then I did some scan tests leaving the lid open, and the results were the same.\nI took one of the scanned prints and placed it on the computer screen, with the scan under it: they all tend to be a bit longer (in height), or, maybe, a bit thinner (in width). This is because i usually scan every picture from top to bottom, without rotating them (except when they're too large and I need to rotate them by 90°, although that almost never happens).\nSo, I thought: are all the scans I've made during these months warped/distorted/etc.?\nI just hope it's not a faulty unit. But considering that I tried another two V600s in separate occasions, and that they produced similar results, I think this distortion thing is something that belongs to pretty much all CCD-based scanners.\nAlso, leaving the print in the same spot and scanning it many times produces the same result. So, I don't think it's a mechanical (stepper motor/gears/belt) flaw.\nMy goal was to have a scan as faithful as possible to the physical print. So, I've been very cautious with dust, dirt, etc. But then I discovered this kind of distortion...\nBut after all, as you said at the end of your comment, for the price (and for most users) it's good enough. Maybe perfection is impossible to achieve, and, well, unless I go and buy some extremely expensive unit or completely change scanning gear (without having the techical abilities to do so, I'm talking about DLSR scanning), I should probably be happy with the results.",

There is a lens involved after all.\nAnything affecting the long edge is likely a mechanical issue. This could be a faulty stepper motor, worn gears/teeth, bad rails, or a bad belt. Anything interfering with it gliding smoothly and predictably under the print.\nFor most users a 1-2% error should be fine as long as it remains consistent. Lens issues for the most part they should be consistent but mechanical issues can be unpredictable and random.\nYour typical shitty machines like printers won't be consistent in either dimension.\nIt's very common for them to have issues affecting the long edge due to mechanical issues which can be very bad causing issues viewing their images even at a glance. For CCD machines their optical designs will vary and some will be better than others but none will be 100% perfect. For CIS machines most have gaps between the sensor modules that cause issues in scans and a lot of them are 5% or more out of spec regarding the DPI which is pretty crazy considering they don't use a lens like CCD ones do.\nIf you're using a decent CCD scanner and finding things are chaotic, you're probably using it wrong.\nThe V600 should be decent and good enough to not have to scan things multiple times rotated for stacking or anything, so I'm not sure why you're stacking images. Is it just for testing?\nIf you want more predictable scans be sure to always use the center of the glass. This will use the center of the lens instead of the edges, and most importantly it will ensure you're using the same part of the lens. If you scanning something in a corner then you scan it in the middle I would not be surprised if they don't stack perfectly. If you're a degree off in placement and rotating to align two separate scans from different areas on the glass I'd expect that to work out even worse. These may be things that the more expensive V850 does better at but I don't know. I would probably bet against it and consider 1-2% to be acceptable and part of the design. The more expensive A3 Expression machines might even be worse due to having a larger bed and the whole autofocus system. On all CCD based machines without mechanical flaws affecting the long axis I would expect the center part of the glass to yield consistent results with the lowest distortion.\nIn my experience I have not had any significant issues with my V600. I have noticed this behavior but have not found it to really be a problem. In my case the ratio appears accurate to <1% or so at least in the center and I have not had serious issues with the mechanical side. If I leave something on the glass and run multiple scans, the images stack well. In comparison, with shitty machines like printers the issues caused by mechanical flaws were visually bad, not just measurable. If I move things around the glass on the V600 between scans and then try to stack, that is a problem but I don't ever need to do that. It is a little disappointing that we can't have perfection but even with its flaws it seems close enough for me for the price.",

                    "content": "Well, can I say I was hoping for a reply from you?\nI've been reading a lot this subreddit, and you've always appeared very knowledgeable.\nThat said:\nmy previous scanner was a Canon CanoScan LiDE 400, but other than being a bit slow, it had the infamous \"missing pixel lines\" problem (see here: https://www.reddit.com/r/DataHoarder/comments/1bnuof1/scanner_causing_these_misalignment_areas/), which you referenced in your comment.\nSo, after reading many threads and posts, I went for the V600.\nWhich is great, absolutely.\nHowever, I see that this lens distortion problem is brought up very seldom on the internet, maybe meaning that it's hardly noticeable, unless you're extremely nit-picking (like I seem to be...)?\nActually, I'm not making multiple scans of the same print with different placements: I noticed this by chance, after rotating a print and scanning it again. The difference was quite noticeable.\nAlso, as you said, changing the placement of the photograph on the scanner glass changes the scan a bit, like faces are thinner in a spot, but fatter in another one.\nI'd like to post some examples, but I'd prefer not to do so for privacy reasons.\nAt first I thought it was a print flatness problem. But then I did some scan tests leaving the lid open, and the results were the same.\nI took one of the scanned prints and placed it on the computer screen, with the scan under it: they all tend to be a bit longer (in height), or, maybe, a bit thinner (in width). This is because i usually scan every picture from top to bottom, without rotating them (except when they're too large and I need to rotate them by 90°, although that almost never happens).\nSo, I thought: are all the scans I've made during these months warped/distorted/etc.?\nI just hope it's not a faulty unit. But considering that I tried another two V600s in separate occasions, and that they produced similar results, I think this distortion thing is something that belongs to pretty much all CCD-based scanners.\nAlso, leaving the print in the same spot and scanning it many times produces the same result. So, I don't think it's a mechanical (stepper motor/gears/belt) flaw.\nMy goal was to have a scan as faithful as possible to the physical print. So, I've been very cautious with dust, dirt, etc. But then I discovered this kind of distortion...\nBut after all, as you said at the end of your comment, for the price (and for most users) it's good enough. Maybe perfection is impossible to achieve, and, well, unless I go and buy some extremely expensive unit or completely change scanning gear (without having the techical abilities to do so, I'm talking about DLSR scanning), I should probably be happy with the results.",

For one example, it requires the beginning and end of the file to be fully intact and uncorrupted to even play at all, whereas mkv can pick up playing from anywhere within a datastream, and includes much more robust seeking capabilities. Mkv can also embed just about any metadata, arbitrary file attachments, all subtitle formats, and all video and audio formats. And unlike MP4, it is not patented. MP4's dominance likely has more to do with the financial interests of companies in the MPEG group, rather than any technical merits. Mkv is becoming much more common these days and is generally what archivists will expect to see. You can also use webm, which is a subset of mkv containing only the features compatible with web browsers.",

It's really a simplified form of MKV (All WebMs are MKVs, but not vice versa) intended to resolve the compatibility nightmare that is digital media with so many different codecs in use. It's no good for recording to, so won't fit that use care, but it's a potential good choice for the finished format. It's the most open-source-friendly of all the formats. The greatest weakness is also the greatest strength: It's very constrained in what it'll accept codec-wise, being intentionally limited to only a small number of open-source codecs. Limiting as this is, it also means that anything which can play WebM (including web browsers) will play any WebM - no risk of the file not working because of a missing codec.",

You can get 2 4TB HDDs for less than a single 4TB SSD and it will be much less likely that both of them fail at once compared to a single SSD.\nYou are very unlikely to find actual data on how reliable those drives are. Someone would have to buy like 10-20,000 of each and run them in a controlled environment for like a decade to get decent data. Ideally 10x that to cover different environments. So all you will find is anecdotal evidence.\nSome drives have some design flaws that will kill a lot of drives prematurely like some of the drives Sandisk makes. And Samsung had a bunch of firmware issues over the years. However, keep in mind that those drives are build to meant a certain price point and Q&A can only do so much so some infant mortality is to be expected, on top of external factors. So while it is less likely for a brand new drive to fail than for a very old one, any drive can still fail at any time. This is why you have backups.\nDo not hunt for the \"golden drive\". Especially for backup drives stuff like performance, thermal issues and the like are often far less relevant than for your main drive. \"Whatever is on sale right now\" is usually good enough.",

Regarding cable management, are there things I should change regarding how I plug the drives? For example, should I connect them all to the caldigit hub?\nDon't know about Windows settings, but in terms of cable management I would think it best to actually have them plugged into separate USB ports on different buses directly to the computer. If you have everything going into one hub, then through one cable into a single USB port in your computer it might be one bottleneck in your current setup. You'd also want to make sure everything is USB 3.x compliant (including cables), so nothing is defaulting to USB 2.x standard which would be another major bottleneck.\n  Second of all, if I were to change laptops/PC, are there computer specs that would allow me to speed up the indexing/scanning process?\nFrom a brief glance it seems Czkawka performance is based on CPU and can parallelize, so something like a Ryzen 3950x with 16 cores would probably help with this particular task. A desktop motherboard will also likely have more and better USB ports and throughput. If you are considering upgrading and truly organizing your storage, you might consider a sort of server-style desktop setup which can potentially house and serve like 10-16 HDD to your household.\n  Third of all, if my main focus is the ability to quickly index/scan files, what kind of HDD/SSD specs should I look for? Highest reading/writing speeds and that's it?\nIn particular you want to look at random small file read speeds for the devices being indexed (RND4K speeds in CrystalDiskMark). HDD will always be pretty slow in this regard when it comes to reading tons of small files, SSD is much faster at this task especially since there is no drive head that needs to continually move around. If you can, it would be better to have small files on SSD and large files on HDD.\n  Finally, what software would you recommend, and why ? In the past, I used to use Alldup, but I wanted to have a look at Czkawka. However, I don't really know which is the best. I plan on doing the same task with Alldup to compare the processing speed of both software.\nI don't have much experience with any particular duplicate finding software in this aspect, but it would be great if you test them out and share your results! There might also be some better alternatives to using Windows as your main file management and explorer -- something that uses a more dedicated database and is written to be more performative. Depending on the types of files, there may be specific software that will have built-in tools to accomplish your specific desired outcome, like for example a photo manager like Digikam or a media manager like Jellyfin.",

            "content": "Two days for this amount of data, read sequentially sounds about right. You are not unique in having a huge collection of external HDDs. Most on this sub will suggest you get all of your data onto a NAS system (one huge disk), and have a 2nd NAS just for the backup of the first one (at a minimum). Long-term this is the most efficient option if you are going to continue hoarding and also makes deduping and everything else easier. However if you only want to occasionally or rarely access the data then read on...\nSounds like question you are trying to ask is, do I have an I/O bottleneck? The answer is most likely yes. And of course the fix to that is faster read speeds per device, or more parallel devices, or both.\nFor the former, use a synthetic HDD benchmark to experiment with how things are connected. Only sequential read at large block sizes matters (usually, unless there is a crapton of very small files).\nFor the latter, IDK (do your own research). Gemini says no, but you can work around it by running multiple instances.\nThe most efficient means is to connect as many drives as possible, then start a parallel scan on each drive. Even if it starts to bottleneck, you won't have to babysit the process. Or you can stop adding drives when you see it bottlenecking. You want to have a least a little bottleneck going to saturate the hardware and maximize throughput.\nThere aren't any Windows settings, just observe task manager etc and see there is there is no disk activity on your drives from another program, and if so identify it and shut it down.",

Unless you are using the TS3 Plus or an older dock, all USB ports on your CalDigit dock are likely running through a single USB BUS (this is a limitation of USB and Thunderbolt 4 spec), so if any individual drive is hitting the connection particularly hard, you could bottleneck other drives' speeds.\nWhether or not that matters for your particular use-case, I leave to you to decide. Let me know if there's anything else I can help with related to our products!",

Very easy user interface, requires an account login, and you’re good to go. You’ll definitely find stories of people’s accounts getting banned for using this but I’ve used it for months without issue. You definitely won’t be able to jump in and archive 500 profiles in one day. But if you take it slow you can definitely save a lot.",

The interesting thing is that the cartoons with actual writing and a good storyline, make her ask me all sorts of questions. The YouTube brain rot does nothing like that.\nFor my friends I have invited them to my Plex server to great succes. A lot of them can hardly access older movies or shows like someone that knows how to download them. The plex app makes it much easier for them to find it on your server. As a matter of fact, all 5 of my friends that I have shared my server with have stopped all of their subscription services.\nSometimes I make a new collection of cool movies, send them a link through WhatsApp of that collection that opens it up in their plex app and all of a sudden we are all talking about the viewing experience a couple of days later.\nIt's absolutely fantastic and they have really changed their viewing habits.",

Cannot understand my small obssession of sourcing new material, better copies of media than I already have and the fun I have curating my collection. Though she does like having access to more great movies and TV.\nWe do have two adult sons however that are serious computer nerds, one a software engineer whos spent years with companies like Disney and AWS and the other who's a month off of receeiving his PHD in electrical engineering. Why it's not called computer science at this level....I still don't get. :)\nAnyhow.....these guys get it. :) Especially the software engineer, who has a home lab a considerable collection as well, though he is going to be setting us up so he can pull content from my server to add to his.

No soldering is needed if you clip to the RF pins with a test lead like an alligator clip or a hook probe. VCR's were often designed to make it easy to view the raw signal with an oscilloscope. One of my 2 VCR's has a straight wire that you can clip to, and the other one has DuPont connectors for the video and audio RF so I use a female-to-male GPIO wire.\nwas there a USB video capture device that is compatible with Mac on OBS that can capture both interlaced frames\nI recommended against using OBS Studio because it only supports progressive video so you would have to get it to interpret 29.97i as 59.94p at half the vertical resolution (basically 240p60 which is how bob de-interlacing works). I don't know of a way to do that and even if it's possible, it's not going to be good. Since you want both fields, I assume that you want them to be handled properly so you should capture as interlaced and let QTGMC's advanced motion-compensated algorithm maintain the vertical resolution.\nI did not ask for the best way of capturing analog video\nI understand which is why I didn't recommend the other devices that I normally suggest for the highest quality. I suggested RF capture because they have 2 Mac-compatible USB devices for that and it gets both fields properly, unlike a lot of conventional devices that throw away one of the fields.\nYou kinda of answered it with the GV2-USB, but then you said “But it don’t know if it’s Mac-Compatible.”\nI saw 1 result that seemed to say that it was Mac-compatible but I couldn't find it again so it's probably not a good choice. I heard that there is a version of the ATI TV All-In-Wonder USB for Mac but a lot of the good conventional capture devices are designed for Windows and RF capture devices are the only ones that I know for sure can do full raw capture on Mac and preserve both fields.",

Using RF capture will let you get both fields, get S-Video from cheap VCR's that don't normally support it (using S-Video instead of composite is where most of the quality improvement is going to come from), and use the free software TBC that comes with vhs-decode.

No soldering is needed if you clip to the RF pins with a test lead like an alligator clip or a hook probe. VCR's were often designed to make it easy to view the raw signal with an oscilloscope. One of my 2 VCR's has a straight wire that you can clip to, and the other one has DuPont connectors for the video and audio RF so I use a female-to-male GPIO wire.\nwas there a USB video capture device that is compatible with Mac on OBS that can capture both interlaced frames\nI recommended against using OBS Studio because it only supports progressive video so you would have to get it to interpret 29.97i as 59.94p at half the vertical resolution (basically 240p60 which is how bob de-interlacing works). I don't know of a way to do that and even if it's possible, it's not going to be good. Since you want both fields, I assume that you want them to be handled properly so you should capture as interlaced and let QTGMC's advanced motion-compensated algorithm maintain the vertical resolution.\nI did not ask for the best way of capturing analog video\nI understand which is why I didn't recommend the other devices that I normally suggest for the highest quality. I suggested RF capture because they have 2 Mac-compatible USB devices for that and it gets both fields properly, unlike a lot of conventional devices that throw away one of the fields.\nYou kinda of answered it with the GV2-USB, but then you said “But it don’t know if it’s Mac-Compatible.”\nI saw 1 result that seemed to say that it was Mac-compatible but I couldn't find it again so it's probably not a good choice. I heard that there is a version of the ATI TV All-In-Wonder USB for Mac but a lot of the good conventional capture devices are designed for Windows and RF capture devices are the only ones that I know for sure can do full raw capture on Mac and preserve both fields.",

Just make sure you do sensible stuff and setup your NAS according to best practices.\nThe danger with most NAS comes from badly configured default settings, and not simply from connecting a NAS to a network alone, or leaving it powered on when not in use. Of course, if you don’t need to access your files via the local network, you could also use a DAS instead of a NAS.\nOr if you’re using this purely for backups, you could setup the NAS to power on and off on a schedule (this is relatively simple to setup with Synology’s software, I have mine configured to power on/off on a schedule and you can set up different times for each day, or weekdays vs weekends). Then you can coordinate this with your backup schedule, e.g. schedule your NAS to power on 10 mins before your backup is scheduled to start.\nPersonally I like using a NAS because spinning disks can get noisy, so I run it separately from my main computer.

The NP switches is used to clean up the log file and mean that you don't see percentages filling up the log, The NJH and NFL also makes the logs cleaner by not producing a header text and file list in he log file, just the files that were copied this run.\nIt's not perfect and I agree with the other user who said this might be an issue with your network connection, if you are copying off an old or cheap NAS device, likely the CPU isn't that powerful and using too many threads just causes lockups, start with 4 threads and work up/down from there to find the sweet spot in your setup.",

The only downside here is that there may be errors introduced into the text by the OCR software if the image is unclear, but it would still make for the easiest read, I think - you could always run a spell check over the whole thing when it's done just to be sure.\nI've restored some scans like this manually in photoshop, which basically involves adjusting the white and black points and then boosting the contrast so that all of that greyscale in the middle (what you see underneath the text) is eliminated. But it was a really slow process and I'm not sure how you'd automate it (using photoshop's batch function anyway) because the amount of grey can (and probably will) vary from page to page.",

Held all media, user files, single Docker container. That NAS is powered off just under a week now.\nSynology RS1619xs+ with expansion unit. 12 x 14TB. This is my NAS for VMware virtual machines. About 100 of them, most not powered on. This machine also has backups of user files and some media, about 11TB in backups total.\nSynology RS2418RP+. 8 x 18TB. This NAS replaced the DS3615xs and has all user files and media on it. Runs backups and contains Veeam backup repositories. Also some VM replicas.\nSynology DS1010+ with expansion unit. 10 x 6TB. My oldest NAS. 14 years. In a powered-off state, it is powered on occasionally and contains a copy of about half the media, err... Linux ISOs...\nHomebuilt TrueNAS SCALE machine. 5 x 18TB. In a powered-off state, it is also powered on occasionally and also contains a copy of about half the Linux ISOs I own. Every time this machine is updated there are new issues. Not hardware related. Ahem.\nRobocopy batch files keep those last two NASes in sync when powered on.\nSynology DS220+. 2 x 12TB. This is the only Synology NAS that I own that supports WORM/immutable storage with which I am experimenting. No production data on this NAS. Yet.\nNew: UGREEN all-flash DXP480T Plus. 2 x 2TB. Nice device and attractively priced on Kickstarter. No particular use. In a powered-off state for now.\nSo, in summary, the two big rack NASes are both housing data, whether it be user data, media, or virtual machines. One backs up the other as much as practical.\nTwo powered-off NASes have copies of all media not otherwise on the two RackStations. Linux ISOs.\nThe NASes that are usually powered off are plugged into smart outlets so they draw no power when not in use.\nMaybe this will give you some ideas?",

The desktop client app then starts downloading anything registered as \"pulled\" in small chunks, kinda like bittorrent does. its insanely slow and often stops syncing for unknown reasons... the site was just too slow (at least on my connection) to get anywhere meaningful this way.

You technically could set up multiple zpools on the leftover capacity of the disks, but that gets very complicated very quickly.\nPlus, even though I'd have the capability to go above 4 drives, it sounds like migrating there isn't any easier.\nI think you need some new disks regardless of what you go with.\nI'm curious what folks here would do. Anyone made a migration away from Synology they're really happy with? Should I just stick with Synology?\nI have had a Synology for half a year, and TrueNAS for 5 ish years. The main benefit for Synology IMO is how idiot proof it is. A buddy of mine set his up with next to zero tech knowledge (ie. He didn't know what an SSD is until recently), and as far as I can tell he didn't do anything majorly wrong like making a RAID 0, port forwarding, etc. However hes sorta stuck with 4 disks unless he buys one of their JBODs or get a higher end unit. Also if it dies out of warranty hes kinda SOL.\nVersus TrueNAS. It requires a bit of tech knowledge and RTFM-ing, but going by the mention of a proxmox server it should be easy enough for you. I know its a bit ironic given some of ZFS's limitations, but its actually surprisingly flexible in some areas. I had a dedicated NAS built from an old desktop, worked fine minus some PSU issues and me not RTFM-ing. Plopped the disks into a brand new server chassis with a different board, different controller etc, worked just fine. Then a few years later I moved the disks to my Windows PC, set up a VM using Hyper-V, passed the disks through. Had some issues because apparently Hyper-V doesn't like wifi, and the built in virtual switch is made for masochists. But other than that, works fine.\nYou can even run it off a raspberry pi if you really really really want to, by using emulation to go from ARM to x86. Wouldn't exactly recommend this, but it does technically work and picks up the zpool.\nFor OMV, it works well enough I suppose. Has most of the benefits of TrueNAS and is more flexible when it comes to software and RAID. Personally I've had a lot of issues with the configuration breaking every other time I changed something, and updating the config takes absolutely forever. This is kinda why I started experimenting with running TrueNAS on a raspberry pi.\nI'm assuming your proxmox server is x86 and not ARM. But if it is, I'd suggest you look into Cockpit instead of OMV.",

I like that the form factor stays roughly the same over time. I personally use the Seagate Expansion External Hard Drives with USB 3.0 . They are widely available, and cost effective on sale.\nAdditionally, I avoid the smaller and more portable travel sized external drives. I think they produce more heat, and the data transfer isn't as good as the larger office format.\nIf I need the portability, I'll have my immediate data needs on one ( or more ) 1 TB MicroSD card(s). I don't feel that external hard drives are robust enough for travel.\nI don't leave External Hard Drives permanently plugged into my computer; I'll only use them to transfer data in order to save them wear and tear. You'll notice that if you leave a Drive plugged in, it will randomly spin up and down.\nI tend to stick with the 16 TB or 14 TB size as the cost per TB is much much better. Wait for a sale -- Back to School, Xmas -- and get two.\nSSDs are not as reliable as the old fashion large spinning disk hard drives. SSDs are prized for their speed, and I think more appropriate as the main internal drive of your computer.\nI'm not sure if your ejection problem is really a problem or not. What I do know is that whenever I encounter any strange behavior, it's time to make a second copy while you still can. And start checking Amazon for a sale. However much you pay for a hard drive will pale in comparison to using a data recovery service.",

Potentially with btrfs for bitrot (on either one, i.e. Syno or regular Linux, although Syno have a little more secret sauce in between, but nothing too critical).\nbtrfs itself is the most flexible as far as adding and removing, plus mixing drives, but it has this warning about RAID5/6 since 2017 or so. Especially if you don't keep the metadata on RAID5/6 you should be perfectly fine IMHO, although there were over the time many reports of btrfs borking itself unrelated to RAID5/6 so probably I wouldn't use it for any serious/large array.\nIn fact mind-bogglingly ALL systems we have, except the very niche unraid and snapraid have the (I'd say usually undesired but I had flame wars with people supporting the opposite!) characteristic that you can lose more data than the drives you've lost. Unraid is fine, except that it has its own quirky OS and not only paid but DRMed/linked to hardware (and to a USB stick of all things!); it can also do btrfs so that's the only solution we have. Snapraid is the maximum of flexibility, plus it checksums everything no matter on what file systems you work, BUT it isn't real time.",

I made a pool of 3 mirrored pairs of 6TB drives. When that space ran out, I added another pair of 16TB drives. When that space ran out, I added another pair of 16TB drives. If I were to run out of drive bays, I could pull one of the 6TB drives out and replace it with another 16TB drive. Once the pool is done resilvering, you can pull the other 6TB drive to make it a pair of 16TB drives to expand the pool size.\nRAID10 like this has excellent read/write performance, can tolerate 1-2 (or more if youre lucky) drive failures, rebuilds are instant (no raid 5 write hole issue, or more strain on other drives when rebuilding). The only downside is that your available drive space is half of your RAW drive space - not as efficient as RAIDZ2 might be.",

They're not the big stack of rar files that get put on the FTPs, they just get repackaged with the extra files removed and put up on public trackers. Torrentgalaxy has a lot of these, or look at the overall top/most seeded torrents on 1337x and there's quite a number of scene releases that have leaked down and got repackaged by others. Even on private music trackers, the scene releases eventually get down to them, and they're well trusted for their quality, especially for flac collectors.",

I have a 3 year old daughter and she is not allowed to watch the YouTube brain rot except for Ms Rachel.\nI have setup a Plex server that has carefully manicured Playlist for my daughter. The interesting thing is that the cartoons with actual writing and a good storyline, make her ask me all sorts of questions. The YouTube brain rot does nothing like that.\nFor my friends I have invited them to my Plex server to great succes. A lot of them can hardly access older movies or shows like someone that knows how to download them. The plex app makes it much easier for them to find it on your server. As a matter of fact, all 5 of my friends that I have shared my server with have stopped all of their subscription services.\nSometimes I make a new collection of cool movies, send them a link through WhatsApp of that collection that opens it up in their plex app and all of a sudden we are all talking about the viewing experience a couple of days later.\nIt's absolutely fantastic and they have really changed their viewing habits.",

Regarding cable management, are there things I should change regarding how I plug the drives? For example, should I connect them all to the caldigit hub?\nDon't know about Windows settings, but in terms of cable management I would think it best to actually have them plugged into separate USB ports on different buses directly to the computer. If you have everything going into one hub, then through one cable into a single USB port in your computer it might be one bottleneck in your current setup. You'd also want to make sure everything is USB 3.x compliant (including cables), so nothing is defaulting to USB 2.x standard which would be another major bottleneck.\n  Second of all, if I were to change laptops/PC, are there computer specs that would allow me to speed up the indexing/scanning process?\nFrom a brief glance it seems Czkawka performance is based on CPU and can parallelize, so something like a Ryzen 3950x with 16 cores would probably help with this particular task. A desktop motherboard will also likely have more and better USB ports and throughput. If you are considering upgrading and truly organizing your storage, you might consider a sort of server-style desktop setup which can potentially house and serve like 10-16 HDD to your household.\n  Third of all, if my main focus is the ability to quickly index/scan files, what kind of HDD/SSD specs should I look for? Highest reading/writing speeds and that's it?\nIn particular you want to look at random small file read speeds for the devices being indexed (RND4K speeds in CrystalDiskMark). HDD will always be pretty slow in this regard when it comes to reading tons of small files, SSD is much faster at this task especially since there is no drive head that needs to continually move around. If you can, it would be better to have small files on SSD and large files on HDD.\n  Finally, what software would you recommend, and why ? In the past, I used to use Alldup, but I wanted to have a look at Czkawka. However, I don't really know which is the best. I plan on doing the same task with Alldup to compare the processing speed of both software.\nI don't have much experience with any particular duplicate finding software in this aspect, but it would be great if you test them out and share your results! There might also be some better alternatives to using Windows as your main file management and explorer -- something that uses a more dedicated database and is written to be more performative. Depending on the types of files, there may be specific software that will have built-in tools to accomplish your specific desired outcome, like for example a photo manager like Digikam or a media manager like Jellyfin.",

            "content": "Two days for this amount of data, read sequentially sounds about right. You are not unique in having a huge collection of external HDDs. Most on this sub will suggest you get all of your data onto a NAS system (one huge disk), and have a 2nd NAS just for the backup of the first one (at a minimum). Long-term this is the most efficient option if you are going to continue hoarding and also makes deduping and everything else easier. However if you only want to occasionally or rarely access the data then read on...\nSounds like question you are trying to ask is, do I have an I/O bottleneck? The answer is most likely yes. And of course the fix to that is faster read speeds per device, or more parallel devices, or both.\nFor the former, use a synthetic HDD benchmark to experiment with how things are connected. Only sequential read at large block sizes matters (usually, unless there is a crapton of very small files).\nFor the latter, IDK (do your own research). Gemini says no, but you can work around it by running multiple instances.\nThe most efficient means is to connect as many drives as possible, then start a parallel scan on each drive. Even if it starts to bottleneck, you won't have to babysit the process. Or you can stop adding drives when you see it bottlenecking. You want to have a least a little bottleneck going to saturate the hardware and maximize throughput.\nThere aren't any Windows settings, just observe task manager etc and see there is there is no disk activity on your drives from another program, and if so identify it and shut it down.",

Unless you are using the TS3 Plus or an older dock, all USB ports on your CalDigit dock are likely running through a single USB BUS (this is a limitation of USB and Thunderbolt 4 spec), so if any individual drive is hitting the connection particularly hard, you could bottleneck other drives' speeds.\nWhether or not that matters for your particular use-case, I leave to you to decide.

On unload the head's lift tabs interacts with the ramp, which is metal on plastic contact. Iirc disks also have special loading zones free of data since there can be head contact on load.\nStill unload is much easier on the drive than full spin down (~600k vs ~60k cycles). With bad access pattern and drive configuration you always trigger full spin ups and easily reach the 60k. Which is also not guaranteed, but only what it should ideally take. I don't know how many seeks a drive typically does in comparison, but I would guess hundreds of millions.",

Does that sound ok to you? The 600k number isn't even that accurate and only under perfect conditions. The moving parts should be rated to lost the longest, not the least. A HDD should manage itself in a way to last AT LEAST 30,40+ years, not fucking barely over 10 with perfect conditions.\nPlease change your thinking, its just plain wrong in this case, sorry.",

But that probably meant that the drives that failed (not the drives that are still working) have failed on an average after 4 years (also if you have one drive that failed after ~8 years, and another drive after ~1 month, then that's also an average of ~4years: does that mean any drive have failed directly after ~4 years? 😎) I do recommend to read up on the \"bathing tube\" curve. The amount of drives that failed are a usually a rather small part of the whole drive fleet of Blackblaze (one or 2 percent?). Also keep in mind that the workload and situation in a data centre can be quite different from any home use.\nAnyway… what keeps your data safe is backups. Nothing else! Any device (be it a HDD, or an SSD, whatever) can fail at any time.\nFrom my own experiences SSDs fail usually catastrophically (BOOM, gone), HDDs usually fail with more chance for rescue. Also considering that the TB/$ price is still in favour of HDDs I only trust my long term backups on HDDs. But that's just how I handle it.\nBTW: Cold storage is not drives that are inside your \"hot\" working PC. Cold storage is unpowered drives stuck away safely.",

You place your bets and see how the dice fall.\nI expect to replace my drives a few times during the next 10 years. I expect to lose data if I don't have multiple GOOD backups.\nMy strategy is to buy large drives with 5 years warranty from reputable brands. I try to avoid increasing the number of drives. Instead replacing the drives I have with larger drives, when they show signs of failing. \nI have good backups. I don't use RAID. My main backup tools are rsync and bash. I use the rsync link destination feature to create frequent versioned rsync snapshot style full backups with file level deduplication. Usually daily if there are changes. I also use snapraid for mostly static data. The number of backup copies is roughly proportional to the value I place on the data. At least one backup copy, unless it is very easy to replace. Usually two or three copies. Very rarely more than 5 copies.\nI don't buy refurbished. I still haven't bought QLC. My current PC only has room for two m.2 NVMe devices. No 2.5\" or 3.5\" SATA drives, so I converted most of my larger old SATA SSDs to externals, using cheap Orico USB C enclosures.\nMy latest HDD purchase was 2x18TB Seagate X18 Exos. 8 months ago.\nMy latest PCIe SSD purchase was 2x4TB Lexar NM790. 6 months ago.\nMy latest SATA SSD purchase was 4TB Crucial MX500. Two years ago.\nDuring the last 5 years, only drives well out of warranty have failed for me. I count that as luck.",

You technically could set up multiple zpools on the leftover capacity of the disks, but that gets very complicated very quickly.\nPlus, even though I'd have the capability to go above 4 drives, it sounds like migrating there isn't any easier.\nI think you need some new disks regardless of what you go with.\nI'm curious what folks here would do. Anyone made a migration away from Synology they're really happy with? Should I just stick with Synology?\nI have had a Synology for half a year, and TrueNAS for 5 ish years. The main benefit for Synology IMO is how idiot proof it is. A buddy of mine set his up with next to zero tech knowledge (ie. He didn't know what an SSD is until recently), and as far as I can tell he didn't do anything majorly wrong like making a RAID 0, port forwarding, etc. However hes sorta stuck with 4 disks unless he buys one of their JBODs or get a higher end unit. Also if it dies out of warranty hes kinda SOL.\nVersus TrueNAS. It requires a bit of tech knowledge and RTFM-ing, but going by the mention of a proxmox server it should be easy enough for you. I know its a bit ironic given some of ZFS's limitations, but its actually surprisingly flexible in some areas. I had a dedicated NAS built from an old desktop, worked fine minus some PSU issues and me not RTFM-ing. Plopped the disks into a brand new server chassis with a different board, different controller etc, worked just fine. Then a few years later I moved the disks to my Windows PC, set up a VM using Hyper-V, passed the disks through. Had some issues because apparently Hyper-V doesn't like wifi, and the built in virtual switch is made for masochists. But other than that, works fine.\nYou can even run it off a raspberry pi if you really really really want to, by using emulation to go from ARM to x86. Wouldn't exactly recommend this, but it does technically work and picks up the zpool.\nFor OMV, it works well enough I suppose. Has most of the benefits of TrueNAS and is more flexible when it comes to software and RAID. Personally I've had a lot of issues with the configuration breaking every other time I changed something, and updating the config takes absolutely forever. This is kinda why I started experimenting with running TrueNAS on a raspberry pi.\nI'm assuming your proxmox server is x86 and not ARM. But if it is, I'd suggest you look into Cockpit instead of OMV.",

This gave me a consistent corner. Then I could create a consistent page crop size.\nAlso, make sure what you are after isn't already here.",

I wanted to scan them all and put them online.\nThe task was monumental. I ended up paying my kids who were ~14/15 at the time to do it since they wanted money and it was totally worth it for me not to have to do the work. Some of them were done with an old Epson scanner LIDE 220 scanner and some were done with a professional copy stand.\nEven with them doing the scanning and capture work the rest of the work was a huge undertaking. Ideally, the scans all need to be edited so that they're all the same shape and size and some need to be rotated because after the 1435th scan you stop caring so much and just slap 'em in the scanner instead of making sure they're straight. Some will also need to be rescanned.\nDetails of the process can be seen here\nExamples of all the scans can be seen at these sites. Note that those sites load slowly because there are a metric fuck-ton of images and it overwhelms Wordpress: Catalogs, Price Lists, Ads, etc.",

Potentially with btrfs for bitrot (on either one, i.e. Syno or regular Linux, although Syno have a little more secret sauce in between, but nothing too critical).\nbtrfs itself is the most flexible as far as adding and removing, plus mixing drives, but it has this warning about RAID5/6 since 2017 or so. Especially if you don't keep the metadata on RAID5/6 you should be perfectly fine IMHO, although there were over the time many reports of btrfs borking itself unrelated to RAID5/6 so probably I wouldn't use it for any serious/large array.\nIn fact mind-bogglingly ALL systems we have, except the very niche unraid and snapraid have the (I'd say usually undesired but I had flame wars with people supporting the opposite!) characteristic that you can lose more data than the drives you've lost. Unraid is fine, except that it has its own quirky OS and not only paid but DRMed/linked to hardware (and to a USB stick of all things!); it can also do btrfs so that's the only solution we have. Snapraid is the maximum of flexibility, plus it checksums everything no matter on what file systems you work, BUT it isn't real time.",

I made a pool of 3 mirrored pairs of 6TB drives. When that space ran out, I added another pair of 16TB drives. When that space ran out, I added another pair of 16TB drives. If I were to run out of drive bays, I could pull one of the 6TB drives out and replace it with another 16TB drive. Once the pool is done resilvering, you can pull the other 6TB drive to make it a pair of 16TB drives to expand the pool size.\nRAID10 like this has excellent read/write performance, can tolerate 1-2 (or more if youre lucky) drive failures, rebuilds are instant (no raid 5 write hole issue, or more strain on other drives when rebuilding). The only downside is that your available drive space is half of your RAW drive space - not as efficient as RAIDZ2 might be.",

The other two are fully functional. Because of how finicky tape drives can be, and the fact that you need basically the same generation drive to read its tapes, I make sure I always have two drives capable of reading any given tape.\nThe magnets don't wear out (they're electromagnets). What tend to wear out are the other mechanical parts - the internals of a tape drive are roughly watch-making (many, many tiny parts all moving in sequence). I've found there's a weakness in the IBM 3580 leader pin grabber (the arm that pulls the leader pin out of the tape cartridge) - two of my drives have this piece broken. I'm looking to 3D-print some replacements. There are other failure modes though - I have an LTO-4 that loads a tape but then gives a generic failure message that it doesn't recognise the tape, and an LTO-3 that won't load tapes, period. I'm keeping those for spares. I also have an LTO-7 that displays an infuriating SCSI error that I can't seem to find any information on - the drive starts writing fine, but then crashes.\nI have a Tandberg LTO-3 and an LTO-5. The latter just flat out doesn't work (diagnostics return failure). The former works fine. However, I haven't used the former drive for long enough to know how it'll behave.\nSo I have:\n10x IBM 3580s - 5 are functional, 5 are faulty.\n2x Tandbergs - 1 is functional, 1 is faulty.\nGiving me a nice 50% problem rate with both manufacturers! Even so, I prefer the IBM drives as their diagnostic tool, ITDT, is very comprehensive and runs on any platform.\nNote that tape drives will use a SAS interface so you will need a SAS HBA. And you will also need disks fast enough to drive them - often you want a RAID behind them because the tape will stop moving if the data isn't flowing, and that increases wear on it, so you need something able to throw data at the tape continuously without stopping to seek.\nTake this as fair warning that tapes are a difficult field to get into! My setup is starting to come together with Bacula as my backup software - it'll push data to tape as fast as the mechanism will allow (160MB/s for LTO-6). I have lots of different generations of tape I've collected over the years, about 200TB total. The different sizes actually make for convenient backups because I can choose to write entire tapes at once, which they're best at.",

For me, one of the drives wouldn't show up at all unless I used a specific USB cable, but still wouldn't mount. So, I left it plugged in for a bit to see if it would figure itself out, then opened Terminal and typed in some commands from a YouTube tutorial.\nEventually it mounted but in a read only state. I copied things to another drive, double checked over everything, and then reformatted it. Now it works again and I can write to it, but it's incredibly slow and I think it's at USB2.0 speeds. I think what's happened is the USB3.0 pins are damaged, and I needed to use a cable which still supported USB2.0 (Guessing my other cables stopped supporting USB2.0). Not only is it slow, it gets slower and slower, it's practically useless but at least I got the data off it and erased it. I might try and shuck it but it's a WD Elements which I'm pretty sure has the connector soldered down.\nThe other drive showed up in Disk Utility, I did the same things with Terminal, eventually got it to mount. Reformatted it and it seems to be working fine again.\nHere are two of the videos I watched to mount the drives using Terminal:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBz0pCYWYOI\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgwd30nLnMY",

Then I extracted the drive and tried plugging it into other SATA to USB 3 adapters I had lying around.

Potentially with btrfs for bitrot (on either one, i.e. Syno or regular Linux, although Syno have a little more secret sauce in between, but nothing too critical).\nbtrfs itself is the most flexible as far as adding and removing, plus mixing drives, but it has this warning about RAID5/6 since 2017 or so. Especially if you don't keep the metadata on RAID5/6 you should be perfectly fine IMHO, although there were over the time many reports of btrfs borking itself unrelated to RAID5/6 so probably I wouldn't use it for any serious/large array.\nIn fact mind-bogglingly ALL systems we have, except the very niche unraid and snapraid have the (I'd say usually undesired but I had flame wars with people supporting the opposite!) characteristic that you can lose more data than the drives you've lost. Unraid is fine, except that it has its own quirky OS and not only paid but DRMed/linked to hardware (and to a USB stick of all things!); it can also do btrfs so that's the only solution we have. Snapraid is the maximum of flexibility, plus it checksums everything no matter on what file systems you work, BUT it isn't real time.",

I made a pool of 3 mirrored pairs of 6TB drives. When that space ran out, I added another pair of 16TB drives. When that space ran out, I added another pair of 16TB drives. If I were to run out of drive bays, I could pull one of the 6TB drives out and replace it with another 16TB drive. Once the pool is done resilvering, you can pull the other 6TB drive to make it a pair of 16TB drives to expand the pool size.\nRAID10 like this has excellent read/write performance, can tolerate 1-2 (or more if youre lucky) drive failures, rebuilds are instant (no raid 5 write hole issue, or more strain on other drives when rebuilding). The only downside is that your available drive space is half of your RAW drive space - not as efficient as RAIDZ2 might be.",

            "content": "Be warned with tapes - if the drive goes bad, you're in for some expensive repairs. They're enough of a niche market that repair companies usually charge 4 figures as a minimum.\nThere's only really two players in the field - IBM and Tandberg. I have drives from both, but mostly IBM (10 IBM, 2 Tandberg). I have 3 of their LTO-6s - one standalone and two for my TL2000 autoloader. One of the latter is faulty. The other two are fully functional. Because of how finicky tape drives can be, and the fact that you need basically the same generation drive to read its tapes, I make sure I always have two drives capable of reading any given tape.\nThe magnets don't wear out (they're electromagnets). What tend to wear out are the other mechanical parts - the internals of a tape drive are roughly watch-making (many, many tiny parts all moving in sequence). I've found there's a weakness in the IBM 3580 leader pin grabber (the arm that pulls the leader pin out of the tape cartridge) - two of my drives have this piece broken. I'm looking to 3D-print some replacements. There are other failure modes though - I have an LTO-4 that loads a tape but then gives a generic failure message that it doesn't recognise the tape, and an LTO-3 that won't load tapes, period. I'm keeping those for spares. I also have an LTO-7 that displays an infuriating SCSI error that I can't seem to find any information on - the drive starts writing fine, but then crashes.\nI have a Tandberg LTO-3 and an LTO-5. The latter just flat out doesn't work (diagnostics return failure). The former works fine. However, I haven't used the former drive for long enough to know how it'll behave.\nSo I have:\n10x IBM 3580s - 5 are functional, 5 are faulty.\n2x Tandbergs - 1 is functional, 1 is faulty.\nGiving me a nice 50% problem rate with both manufacturers! Even so, I prefer the IBM drives as their diagnostic tool, ITDT, is very comprehensive and runs on any platform.\nNote that tape drives will use a SAS interface so you will need a SAS HBA. And you will also need disks fast enough to drive them - often you want a RAID behind them because the tape will stop moving if the data isn't flowing, and that increases wear on it, so you need something able to throw data at the tape continuously without stopping to seek.\nTake this as fair warning that tapes are a difficult field to get into! My setup is starting to come together with Bacula as my backup software - it'll push data to tape as fast as the mechanism will allow (160MB/s for LTO-6). I have lots of different generations of tape I've collected over the years, about 200TB total. The different sizes actually make for convenient backups because I can choose to write entire tapes at once, which they're best at.",

And yes, past a certain point, adding more tapes is way cheaper and less hassle than adding more HDDs to an array.\nConsider a prior generation like LTO-7 (6TB per tape) or LTO-8 (12TB per tape) - more tapes, but the drives are cheaper than brand new. IBM autoloaders like the Dell TL2000 (which I have, 24 slots), TL4000 (twice the capacity) or the HP MSL8096 (twice the size again) make spreading data across tapes much less of a pain, and they're available on eBay at reasonable prices. Their modular design means even 10-year-old libraries support modern drives on hot-swappable sleds - mine was spec'd with LTO-4 drives from new but I have it writing to LTO-6 now. The Superloader is not quite as friendly to upgrades - the drive is fixed internally. It also has very elegant but oversized magazines using a conveyor mechanism that stores 4 less tapes per side than the IBM ones (16 tapes vs 24 tapes in 2U).\nOnce a tape is out of the drive, it's essentially ransomware-proof. Correctly stored, it's rated to retain data for 20-30 years. This means they make perfect point-in-time backups and are an essential technology in disaster recovery. Every company I've worked for uses tape. An additional advantage is that cloud backup providers have extremely risky ToS's that can include locking your account out for no reason or charging you extra for downloading your data all at once; if you have possession of the physical tapes, nobody can stop you restoring them. I keep my tapes in a storage unit across town.\nIs it perfect? No, nothing ever is. The drives are finicky. I get around this by having one LTO-6 autoloader drive and one LTO-6 standalone drive - if the former craps out and I can't use the autoloader to restore, I can still manually feed the tapes into the latter to get my data back.\nAutomating the system is very complicated because it requires having a catalogue somewhere that stores the complete list of each tape. LTO-5 introduced LTFS which lets you treat tapes like linear-access HDDs and just drag files onto them. I've spent the past year or so trying to get Bacula working and it's been a very, very long process, but it's finally coming together (and usefully, my company wants to switch to Bacula so my efforts have been valuable).",

For me, one of the drives wouldn't show up at all unless I used a specific USB cable, but still wouldn't mount. So, I left it plugged in for a bit to see if it would figure itself out, then opened Terminal and typed in some commands from a YouTube tutorial.\nEventually it mounted but in a read only state. I copied things to another drive, double checked over everything, and then reformatted it. Now it works again and I can write to it, but it's incredibly slow and I think it's at USB2.0 speeds. I think what's happened is the USB3.0 pins are damaged, and I needed to use a cable which still supported USB2.0 (Guessing my other cables stopped supporting USB2.0). Not only is it slow, it gets slower and slower, it's practically useless but at least I got the data off it and erased it. I might try and shuck it but it's a WD Elements which I'm pretty sure has the connector soldered down.\nThe other drive showed up in Disk Utility, I did the same things with Terminal, eventually got it to mount. Reformatted it and it seems to be working fine again.\nHere are two of the videos I watched to mount the drives using Terminal:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBz0pCYWYOI\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgwd30nLnMY",

Then I extracted the drive and tried plugging it into other SATA to USB 3 adapters I had lying around. Confirmed it was actually the drive itself that was dead.\nAt that point, went into Backblaze and initiated a restore and also placed an order for a replacement external hard drive.

Idle_c is the same as standby_y.\nThat leaves only idle_a, idle_b, and standby_z available. Idle_a is a no brainer to keep. Idle_b increases head load/park count I believe. And standby_z causes motor spindown, which depending on your usage pattern might decrease lifespan if start/stop too frequently, but saves the most power.\nIn the end you have to make your own calculations to see which states to keep.

This is overkill for you application, but they are up on ebay for bargain prices atm. Whichever one you go for, just make sure to strap a fan to the heatsink, cable ties are your friend, but I believe a 60mm fan screws straight to 92xx cards (don't quote me on that though).",

When I learned something that I wanted in my life right now, I printed it or wrote it down physically and put it on a wall with blu-tac.\nThe following year, I didn't review my notes as often, and I didnt remember my notes either.\nThe review process is when I decide to make backlinks.

And a huge chunk of pre-established big fan wikis of the past (previously running on MediaWiki or some similar engine) migrated there, too.\nThe obvious problem, just like with Reddit or Discord, is that it's centralized, and that Fandom outright owns the website and all of your Wikias.\nIt gets to dictate what the page layout will be like, and Fandom's pages are ATROCIOUS nowadays. There's a metric ton of unrelated banners for whatever brain goo hype-content-of-the-day, autoplaying videos about those unrelated topics and more shit like that. The page layout/design is a horrible ADHD mess. And you can't even browse image galleries normally anymore because someone at Fandom decided that the website should behave like an app. Every direct link to an image page is forcefully redirected to the main article page, so instead of clicking previews to open in a new tab, you're forced to view images in a pop-up thing on the original page. Also, a while ago they forcibly converted all pre-existing JPGs into WEBPs, which is maybe not necessarily a \"worse\" format on its own, but lossy->lossy conversion, especially of stuff that was already rare and probably in low resolution, is a crime.\nIt gets to dictate the content, too. The GTA wiki had an issue with transcripts of missions and dialogues from San Andreas because (naturally) they had the dreaded \"N-word\" which is somehow 100x worse than \"fuck\". Today Fandom doesn't like this, tomorrow it doesn't like anything that mentions celebrities / well-known people in any form, and your wikia about some movie series is suddenly gone.\nIf you and the hoster of your website start to disagree about some things, you can always pack up all your files and migrate to a different hoster. But you can't pack up a Fandom-hosted wikia, or a Reddit-hosted subreddit, with all of their accumulated content.",

Likely prohibitively expensive but I could be wrong.\nBut yeah obvious economic choice is a single HDD, but if concerned about ruggedness then get a bunch of m.2s. you won't need to spend anywhere remotely close to 10K whatever option you choose.",

And then once you've reached a point where you no longer need it, you upload it to the cloud and delete the local copy. If you ever need that footage again, then pull it back out of the cloud. Backblaze B2 is $6/TB/month, for example. Google Drive plans are in the range of $5/TB/month, which may present a more usable interface for your purposes.\nIf you're concerned about the safety of cloud storage, then you could set something up to mirror your primary cloud storage to a secondary provider, like AWS Glacier.\nThis is fairly dependent on having access to decent internet, but IMO it's worth the compromise to not deal with the risk + hassle of carrying 30+ TB of local storage.\nSome back of the napkin math: at 200GB/week, 7TB (we'll say that you used an extra TB for OS/etc) is 35 weeks of footage. If you're editing on a 3 month delay/backlog, then you can still hold an extra 20 or so weeks worth of footage before you're out of space & have to upload to the cloud. I'm not familiar with your travel habits, but surely you could find somewhere with fast wifi to upload from once every few months.",

Some devices may be fine even when stressed, some may overheat even with light usage.\nThe main catches I'm aware of which are more enclosure specific:\nUSB is just generally quite messy, best results are expected with a good quality short cable directly connected to a host. USB switches occasionally don't really work with storage devices.\nTrim support varies, sometimes it's advertised but buggy. This mostly gets interesting when the SSD starts to get full, in that case the suicidal block juggling operation in case of no trimming should also make it hotter.\nDRAMless SSDs relying on HMB are expected to perform worse in such enclosures, likely also getting hotter as the FTL is quite unlikely to fit into the controller's cache, so there will be more flash memory operations.",

Manufacturers do dumb stuff all the time, including changing pinouts on power supplies in an incompatible way that will immediately break the drive, with zero indication that anything has changed.\nExtracting the drive is a better bet.

Just make sure bad/reallocated sectors (G list), HPA and DCO are covered (ATA secure erase and hdparm).\nMultiple passes methods stem from older MFMs (discontinued by the 90s) and low-desnity drives (like <160mb) to cover for possible encoding methods. Modern drives use algorithms to encode and do not store the same way floppy disks used to, data recovery is exacerbated by their growing size as well. Gutmann issues the same corrected statement. Most governmental standards don't specify more than 3 passes.",

If we lose where we live, the server our docs are on is going to be wrecked. There are offsite backups, but then the question of \"How do we restore the backups, and to what?\" came up.\nAdd to that dealing with insurance companies and how they demand quick turnaround times on the information they ask for (auto insurance most recently, talking with our insurance adjuster about this to come up with answers for the previous question a bit farther back), and the answer becomes \"We could restore from offsite backup, but not quickly enough to get claims filed so we should have additional copies available for quick access.\"\nAs always, your threat model may vary, but it's something to keep in mind.",
