    This Youtube video is based on the Oral Arguments presented by IA in their appeal
    case: https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/67801014/hachette-book-group-inc-v-internet-archive/

    The judges asked a few questions to the lawyer, you can heard all of it in this
    video.

    It seems they can rule about the appeal at any moment, now...

    For those that don''t know, IA lost before: https://time.com/6266147/internet-archive-copyright-infringement-books-lawsuit/'

  content: 'What are their chances?

    While it''s interesting to follow, I don''t get why people think that this is
    near any end.

    It doesn''t matter if they get the judgement overturned or not. As the article
    says and I''ve been saying since this started, it will almost inevitably be appealed
    up to the Supreme Court, where it will probably takes years. The only wild card
    is that the Supreme Court may push it back down to the local appeals court''s
    ruling.

    Bottom line is, these are only battles and the winner is far from being declared.'

    think the argument is serious.

    The IA is clearly pushing the limits of what fair use can justify and I don''t
    think they will win. However libraries providing creating copies of works for
    their users is not completely unprecedented, in Williams & Wilkins Co. v. United
    States the Court of Claims held that providing photocopies of journal articles
    was fair use, the supreme court was equally divided on the issue.'

    the bays, a Kensington security slot, and feet to lift if off the desk.

    The cheaper model is made of plastic, has no fan, uses older USB-B, no locks on
    the bays, no Kensington security slot, and no feet.

    So the aluminum, fan, locks, USB-C, the Kensington security slot, and feet are
    adding $129 to the price tag. If you don''t care about those then get the cheaper
    model. If any of them are "must have" features you wouldn''t be considering the
    cheaper model at all so its price would be irrelevant. Personally no fan is a
    deal breaker.'

post_content: Hi there, to solve my storage problems, I'm planning to buy a 4-bay
  docking station (no RAID) to start setting up a homemade DAS station with new Toshiba
  N300 drives (18TB). But I found different options on Amazon that look the same but
  have very different prices (even though they're the same brand). For example, there's
  this docking station (https://a.co/d/067FRrlm) for $99.99, 4 bays and separate switches,
  and then there's this one (https://a.co/d/06xl1fUB), same brand, also 4 bays but
  $229.99 (plus $58 for import charges). Why such a huge price difference? I missing
  something?

post_content: 'Ignore my terrible cable managementðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£ i ran out of sata cable and fucks
  to give. My server is finally set up and running just how i want it.

  5-500gb ssd''s running as a pre-production pool. I let my system download about
  60 movies/shows at a time and it gets dumped onto there.

  I have 6 14tb hard drives mirroring with a total usable space of 40.5tb with 250gb
  ssd working as a cache drive

  On the software side i have truenas scale managing it all. Outside of that im running
  a headless windows machine that runs kometa as an automated search engine that feeds
  into radarr/sonarr. My library automatically downloads and catagorizes new pieces
  of content.

  Big shout out to hulu, peacock, and hbo max for giving it to me without any lube.
  Without them pissing me off with these high prices, i would have never built this
  beautiful machine.

  My next steps will be updating the hardware. Im lacking when it comes down to my
  memory. Only running 16gb ddr3 non-ecc ram. My processor isnt where it should be.
  Im severly limiting the speed on my hard drive disks since theyre tied into a pcie
  2.0 x1 port. Im happy i get 6 sata connectors right off the board but i have 12
  drives in this case. Lots of stuff going on so these upgrades gotta wait but this
  was a really fun project for the time being. Only decent thing here besides the
  drives is the 3060 12gb
