I was the fastest boy out there, but without a mommy at the end, I came in last place in every single event! When the events came to an end, they couldn‚Äôt even give me a participation trophy because I had never participated. So now, I, Dr. Heinz Doofenshmirtz, have created the Trophy Replaceanator-anator, which will transform first-place trophies into last place trophies, and last-place trophies into first-place trophies, and wreak havoc all over the tri-state area!"

He starts with a photo each time, but says he does the pixel-art by hand. Based on the in-progress vids, I believe it. I don't understand it, but I believe it.",

Those are special animals that are Not Okay To Eat. We get sad when those ones die. But then we kill millions of cows per year and we don't even think about it, those ones don't make us sad at all, even after seeing them behave just as docile and friendly as a cat or dog. It doesn't matter, because those ones are Okay To Eat. The human mind's ability to segment and rationalize things is impressive."

Right-click and pick View / Display control bar to get a control bar at the bottom. In the burger menu on the left of the display bar, select Multipage (it'll default to Animated for GIFs). Now you can press + and - to scrub back and forth, you can enter a frame number, and you can press ctrl-< and ctrl-> to step one frame. If you select Toilet roll (sorry) it'll display the GIF as a vertical strip of frames. Use the mousewheel or i/o to zoom in and out, cursor keys to scroll, ctrl-up and ctrl-down to jump to the top and bottom, shift-up and shift-down to jump a page at a time, etc. The README lists all the keyboard shortcuts. vipsdisp has some other nice features: it can display HUGE images (many, many GB) quickly and only using a little memory supports most popular formats, including HEIC, AVIF, WebP, SVG, JXL, PDF, etc. it scales and displays images on your GPU, with loading and processing done asynchronously with a pool of background worker threads it keeps the last three images loaded, so you can flip between them with alt-left / alt-right, handy for comparing images support for many scientific image formats, like DICOM, SVS, MIRAX, NIfTI, Analyze, HDR, FITS, etc. visualisation controls like scale, offset, falscolour, log colour management use the left/right buttons in the titlebar to flip though a directory of images useful comnmand-line save-as lets you do format conversion, so you can save a GIF as animated webp, for example supports copy-paste, so you can paste a screenshot in, then save-as MIT licence, free, open source, PRs welcome etc.",

The English language has changed a lot over time, and has and had very different regional accents. A lot of the original settlers that came to the Americas would sound wildly different from each other, not one group would have a similar pronounciation. People used to live in way smaller communities, there wasn't a lot of cultural exchange across large distances like we have today with the internet and tv for example. All those small communities would have developed regional differences in their language on their own. This is still very evident today, in most old world nations pronounciation and even language changes dramatically as soon as you travel across the country. Compare a scouser from Liverpool with someone from Glasgow, or Cardiff. In my own country, the Netherlands, people from one end of this relatively small nation have difficulty understanding the other end of the country. A Limburger and a Frisian would have a hard time holding a clear conversation. So no, some individual people might have sounded similar, but there is no clear 'British English' that was spoken then that might have largely sounded like the south of the US sounds today."

For one, it's mentioned that Ithica is in sight just before Aeolus' bag of wind is opened, so I don't understand how the line goes from just east of Sardinia, straight up to the land of Circe. And secondly, where's the detour to the Underworld to meet Tiresias? For some reason, this has Odysseus going immediately back to the coast of Italy, when in fact he should've gone to either the Western horizon or the coast of Epirus (which admittedly is silly for the latter, as Ithica is only a short sail down the coast, but Book X does explicitly mention Acheron flowing into Periphlegethon and Cocytus near the house of Hades) depending on how the translation is read.",

I guess it‚Äôs almost more of a ‚Äúwhat if‚Äù kind of map. You seem to know this story a lot more than me, so does this make sense?

            "content": "As the goby uses the shrimp's burrow for protection from predators, it also acts as \"eyes\" for the pistol shrimp. During the day, the goby hovers above the burrow, feeding and interacting with other gobies. Meanwhile, the shrimp uses its antennae to stay in constant contact with the goby's tail while searching for food (detritus, tiny crustaceans and worms) and maintaining the burrow opening. If a predatory fish approaches, the goby flicks its tail several times, alerting the shrimp to retreat into the burrow. If the predator comes within striking distance, the goby will dart headfirst into the burrow. During the night, the two simply rest together in the burrow. Left out from the quote is that Goby's also use the burrow for mating rituals and they need a safe space. I'd guess the shrimp just watches? People think the Goby has the sweet end of the deal, but the shrimp can barely see and is easy prey for many predators despite its pistol claw, so the Goby's constant eyesight vigilance for predators while the shrimp just cruises around for food in exchange for digging a hole?? I think the shrimp got the sweet end of the deal or it's pretty equal. I like how if a predator is within striking distance the Goby is like \"you're on your own!\"",

                    "content": "Lightning and stepped leader Most lightning flashes are a result of negatively-charged leaders, called stepped leaders. These leaders develop downward in quick steps. Each step is typically about 50 meters (150 ft) in length. Stepped leaders tend to branch out as they seek a connection with the positive charge on the ground. When a branch of the stepped leader reaches within about 50 meters of the ground or some object on the ground, it connects with an upward-developing positive charge, often referred to as an upward streamer. Upward streamers tend to develop from the taller objects beneath one or more branches of the stepped leader. When the downward-developing negative stepped leader makes contact with an upward-developing positive streamer, referred to as the attachment process, a conductive path is established for the rapid discharge of electricity that we see as a bright flash. In general, stepped leaders travel at about 200,000 miles per hour, although speeds vary considerably. The highly visible return stroke moves upward through the leader channel at about 200 million miles per hour. The combination of the stepped leader and return stroke happens in just a fraction of a second. While both leaders and return strokes produce visible light (leaders produce a faint light that is more visible at night), they happen so quickly that the human eye cannot distinguish the two; however, high-speed cameras are able to capture the movement of leaders as they move toward ground. Building aren't particularly conductive (depends of the material), but we usually set a lightning rod to route the lightning and avoid unwanted damage. Given their proximity, it's a little surprising, but it's not like lightning search for the highest point. The mechanism that determine the path is an area of ionized air that grow randomly, and they just happened to be closest spot to where the stepped leader grew."

That's actually one way to purify silver - dissolve it in nitric acid to make silver nitrate, then drop copper pipe into the silver nitrate. The metals do a swoop-and-swap with the nitrate, and you get silver dust precipitating in copper nitrate. Not 100% sure if sulfate works the same, but I suspect so."

            "content": "From a corrosion standpoint, if you coat a less noble metal with a more noble one, you want to be absolutely sure that it‚Äôs 100% covered. If the steel is exposed to oxygen, it will work as a sacrificial anode for the copper nearby. Copper will not oxidate, iron will oxidate in its place. Since there‚Äôs a lot of copper surface exposed to oxygen and a tiny scratch of exposed steel, steel will also corrode a lot faster. Generally it‚Äôs not a great idea to cover steel with something more noble like copper, especially if you expect scratches. It‚Äôs the same reason why it‚Äôs very bad using mild steel fasteners in contact with stainless steel surfaces. The fastener will corrode VERY FAST. Usually steel is coated with zinc, which is less noble and corrodes way slower. In this case the reverse process happens, where the steel scratch is protected by the nearby zinc which acts as sacrificial anode."

                    "content": "Thank you for carefully watching the Panda being sorted) However, I believe this is indeed insertion sort. As I understand, insertion works the following way. It always keeps the first part of the array sorted. Then it picks up the next element (right after the sorted part) and inserts it at the right position among the sorted ones. Thus, the sorted part is gradually increasing. Bubble sort is somewhat similar, but the idea is different. First, it walks through the array from start to finish swapping the pairs of ajacent elements if needed. As a result, the biggest element takes its place at the end. After that, again, bubble sort walks through the array swapping pairs, and the second largest element takes its place. And so on. Again, we see that there is a sorted part of the array which becomes bigger. However, each new element is more like appended to this sorted group, not inserted somewhere in the middle. Bubble sort scans the unsorted part of the array multiple times, whereas the part which insertion sort looks through again and again is the sorted one. For example, let's take an array: 3, 2, 4, 1, 5 What insertion sort is going to do (the sorted part in bold): 3, 2, 4, 1, 5 -> 2, 3, 4, 1, 5 (2 inserted before 3) -> 2, 3, 4, 1, 5 -> 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 (1 inserted at the beginning) -> 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 And bubble sort will do (elements being swapped are in italic, sorted part in bold): 3, 2, 4, 1, 5 -> 2, 3, 4, 1, 5 -> 2, 3, 1, 4, 5 (5 as the biggest element \"bubbles\" to the end) -> 2, 3, 1, 4, 5 -> 2, 1, 3, 4, 5 (4 \"bubbles\" right before 5) -> 2, 1, 3, 4, 5 -> 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 -> 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 -> 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 On the illustration with Panda, one can see (if watching closely üòÖ) that each new square is inserted among the first ones which are already in the correct order. So, it looks like insertion sort for me? Actually, I also made a bubble sort panda demo (at least, the sort algorithm which I believed was the bubble sort üôÇ). If you are interested, it is available here: bubble-sort-panda.gif.",

THE Artist Period I challenged myself to draw a pixel art animation every day in 2024, this is day 134: \"Het uitgaan van de hervormde kerk te Nuenen\" using 12 colors and 40 hand drawn frames. \"Congregation Leaving the Reformed Church at Nuenen\" Description of the original art from Wikipedia: The work was painted in Nuenen, a small village in the North Brabant district of the Netherlands, a few miles northeast of Eindhoven. Van Gogh's father became the pastor of the Dutch Reformed Church in Nuenen in 1882, and Van Gogh lived with his parents at the vicarage in Nuenen from December 1883 to May 1885. During this time, he made a number of paintings of the local peasants, including The Potato Eaters, and also paintings of the church. The oil on canvas painting measures 41.5 by 32 centimetres (16.3 in √ó 12.6 in). It was made in January or February 1884, showing Van Gogh's father's small church, with hedge and bare trees. Van Gogh made the painting for his mother, while she was confined to her house with a broken leg. It was based on an earlier sketch; like the sketch, the painting originally included a peasant with a spade in the foreground, but it later painted out - probably in late 1885 - when Van Gogh also added the congregation, and leaves to bare trees. The congregation are in mourning clothes: Van Gogh's father had died in March 1885 and Vincent may have added the woman in mourning and congregation members for his mother as a memorial for his father's death.

Like for social reinforcement, I could see them say, enjoying rubbing up against each other or making giving some cowlicks, but cuddles? Mofos didn't evolve arms! Allogrooming is a behavioral traits observed for positive social reinforcement in cows (licking), but they don't often cuddle much, outside of with people. It isn't entirely natural behavior for them. But... some have monetized cow cuddling through social media, charging $50-150 an hour to cuddle some cows. Which is silly because they are generally only going to be affectionate with peeps they know and not strangers."

Good though, I imagine a better method would make the render take significantly longer and you wanted some of that reflective/shiny feeling in there. That said, with the fog/smoke and lighting it is somewhat minimizing this effect, so good job on that front.",

Something to keep in mind, that so many games tend to ignore, is that just because someplace has changed, doesn't mean it loses it's personality, there are often many unique leftovers from the past. The more of a unique personality you manage to give a place, the more invested your players are likely to be, and right now the only personality I'm getting from the above image is 'Futuristic'. I did take a look at the other image you linked, but it really doesn't change anything for me. I wish y'all the best of luck, because we can always use more indies, even if I'm not much for card-based games.",

Any future London would hang on to some of it. OP shared a different view with the London Eye visible, but that feels like the most temporary of London's landmarks. Hell, it was only intended as a temporary structure when it was built. Where is St. Paul's? That seems the likeliest structure to remain for the coming centuries, alongside the Tower of London."

However, I'll gladly answer any questions if they are below to this comment. The subject is a friend of mine I have played chess with weekly for some years now. I originally did it as a studio piece 6 or so years ago. I came to the client with several designs new and old, they ultimately chose this one. There was extreme wind so the majority of one day was lost. All told it took about 5 days to paint. It is high quality latex paint, what you would most buildings/houses with. The wall is about 70'-80' high I was paid for this work. I often do jobs for non-profits and such without payment. The dripping paint is intentional. My socials and website are my username here",

These images are from the EPIC sensor (camera) on the NASA DSCOVR satellite at the Sun‚ÄìEarth L1 Lagrange point, meaning it remains (roughly) at a point between the sun and the earth. However, this position is also much further away from earth than GOES-16, so the images are not quite as sharp. DSCOVR also only takes images once per hour, so the animation is not quite as smooth.
