I was the fastest boy out there, but without a mommy at the end, I came in last place in every single event! When the events came to an end, they couldn‚Äôt even give me a participation trophy because I had never participated. So now, I, Dr. Heinz Doofenshmirtz, have created the Trophy Replaceanator-anator, which will transform first-place trophies into last place trophies, and last-place trophies into first-place trophies, and wreak havoc all over the tri-state area!"

A person who raises a cat or a dog for the purposes of killing and eating it is seen as a bad person by most, because cats and dogs don't deserve that. Those are special animals that are Not Okay To Eat. We get sad when those ones die. But then we kill millions of cows per year and we don't even think about it, those ones don't make us sad at all, even after seeing them behave just as docile and friendly as a cat or dog. It doesn't matter, because those ones are Okay To Eat. The human mind's ability to segment and rationalize things is impressive."
