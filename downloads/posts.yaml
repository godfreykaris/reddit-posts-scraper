      SortedDict provide all of the characteristics you''d expect from a TreeMap.

      Key/Value lookups

      O(log N) for insertion and deletion.

      Ordered keys for iteration

      No null keys

      If you work with a decent Python distribution like Anaconda, sortedcontainers
      is already included.

      If not, then just "pip install sortedcontainers"

      You also get SortedSet and SortedList with that for a couple of useful variations
      on the theme.'

    And as mentionned, this has nothing to do in the default libraries, but you can
    make use of bisect module.

    Yeah, keeping it sorted on insertion is better, but do you need it?

    You can just sort the values whenever you need to iterate over them. Leave a comment
    on that and move forward. Maybe you are lucky and the default sort algorithm are
    faster on already sorted list.

    Also, since python 3.6, you don''t need ordered dict anymore, you can just use
    a dict which keeps insertion order (mentionned in the specification). If you don''t
    have time to implement.

    As mentionned, you can use bisect module to have a list of element sorted and
    do lookup on it instead of using a dict NOTE: the behaviour is different when
    re-inserting a key, but there are many solutions depending on your use-case.'

    fair exchange of opinion and maybe someone sharing a valuable insight. Maybe a
    core Python dev could see this post. The corresponding post on StackOverflow was
    closed.

    I know that there''s always a workaround. And I know about `sortedcontainers`.
    This was one of the options I listed in my initial post and I have used it! I
    might have used a strong word to describe the necessity of such a data structure
    by saying: "it''s integral", nevertheless I would not go as far as saying that
    a TreeMap is a niche data structure. It is also taught on computer science curriculums.
    I did not suggest that they should include the Aho-Corasick algo in `stdlib`...

    I am also wondering if all the people saying "I don''t need it" have used a language
    that supports this data structure or if they have just used Python or any other
    language that does not support it. I have been in several situations professionally
    where I''ve thought "a TreeMap would fit great here". Most recently when I had
    a stream of events I had to sample the top K users based on some Comparator (that
    the TreeMap uses for sorting the elements). This sample could be arbitrarily queried
    and the client should have always had a sorted view of the data structure. Of
    course, uniqueness also had to be guaranteed. Apart from professional challenges
    though I find it very frequently used in algorithmic challenges as well! The following
    are a few LeetCode problems I''ve solved by using a TreeMap when I was using Java
    as a main language:

    Fruit into baskets

    Right projection of a binary tree

    Hand of straights

    Find Right Interval

    LFU Cache using TreeMap

    Shortest subarray with a sum of at least K

    Remove invalid parentheses

    The skyline problem

    Odd/Even Jumps

    Binary Search Tree completeness

    I might also be a bit biased since I used Java for many years but all this downvoting
    and sarcastic comments create a very hostile environment.'
