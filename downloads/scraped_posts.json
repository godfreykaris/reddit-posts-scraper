I will thus no longer be updating this archive. The MEGA will remain untouched, so use that as you please, but that will likely die one day as there is a bandwidth/transfer limit. I will be uploading the content to Internet Archive, as well as other sources, but until then the torrent magnet that I will be seeding for a little while is listed below - my bandwidth isn't the best

But I found different options on Amazon that look the same but have very different prices (even though they're the same brand). For example, there's this docking station (https://a.co/d/067FRrlm) for $99.99, 4 bays and separate switches, and then there's this one (https://a.co/d/06xl1fUB), same brand, also 4 bays but $229.99 (plus $58 for import charges). Why such a huge price difference? I missing something?",

If you don't care about those then get the cheaper model. If any of them are \"must have\" features you wouldn't be considering the cheaper model at all so its price would be irrelevant.

    "media": [],
    "post_content": "I recently bought 2 new 8TB HHDs to replace the existing drives in my media server. I am struggling to pick a filesystem. My plan is to use one drive for data, and the other drive as a backup using Kopia (the OS is located on a SSD, the data drive will only hold media). I have a read a lot of good (and some bad) things about BTRFS, but much of it seems to relate to RAID setups, which I will not have. Are there any real advantages of using BTRFS in my case over something more basic, like EXT4? I am newer to using Ubuntu and don't really have experience with RAID setups.",

            "content": "Overall, a number of distributions (Fedora, SLES) use btrfs for their root filesystem. Synology has been using btrfs for its default filesystem for over a decade for x86 based NAS models, and recently has btrfs for all NAS offerings, even the ARM models.\nThe biggest reason why I prefer btrfs over ext4 is bit-rot checking. I can do a btrfs scrub start /path/to/data, wait until it checks all used space, maybe run a btrfs scrub status /path/to/data to see how things are in progress, and have assurance that the data written hasn't been damaged.\nAnother reason is compression and deduplication. This isn't relevant if using it for something like Kopia, but for a general filesystem for a file server, it can greatly help things. btrfs uses offline deduplication with duperemove, and even though it may not be as good as ZFS, it doesn't require the RAM overhead that an always-on deduplication system needs.\nFor long term storage of data, I'd definitely go with btrfs, just because of the bitrot checking. It may not be able to repair the damage if it finds some, but at least you know that it is there.",

Alternatively, one could buy refurbished hard disks, split the data across a few of those, and have multiple sets, then take them offsite and onsite in a GFS (grandfather-father-son) configuration. The advantage of this offline method is that it takes a long time to restore from a cloud provider, probably longer than driving to where the offsite stuff is kept, fetching the most recent drive set, bringing it back, plugging in, and restoring.\nThe trick is to bring in new media, and always, check all media every so often. If a set goes bad, set it aside. This way, because stuff is checked, you won't run into any unpleasant surprised if a drive is bad when you do a restore, and with multiple offsite sets of drives, if there are errors with one set, another set should be clean.",
