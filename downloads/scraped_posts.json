    "post_title": "Big price differences between docking stations?",
    "media": [],
    "post_content": "Hi there, to solve my storage problems, I'm planning to buy a 4-bay docking station (no RAID) to start setting up a homemade DAS station with new Toshiba N300 drives (18TB). But I found different options on Amazon that look the same but have very different prices (even though they're the same brand). For example, there's this docking station (https://a.co/d/067FRrlm) for $99.99, 4 bays and separate switches, and then there's this one (https://a.co/d/06xl1fUB), same brand, also 4 bays but $229.99 (plus $58 for import charges). Why such a huge price difference? I missing something?",

The cheaper model is made of plastic, has no fan, uses older USB-B, no locks on the bays, no Kensington security slot, and no feet. So the aluminum, fan, locks, USB-C, the Kensington security slot, and feet are adding $129 to the price tag. If you don't care about those then get the cheaper model. If any of them are \"must have\" features you wouldn't be considering the cheaper model at all so its price would be irrelevant. Personally no fan is a deal breaker.",

That said I have found the Seagates and WD to all be so close that you can buy on price. Backblaze is a good source but isn\"t the final word as it isn't totally scientific. Not saying it is bad or flawed just that there are variables to consider when looking at the numbers. But fortunately now there aren't lemon drives and warranties are good and companies are stable enough to know they will be around should you need it. Prices are historically good also. I have mostly 14 and 16 TB drives as they tend to be the most cost effective with backup time not being terrible. I haven't seen any real issue with shorter life with higher capacity. Also was concerned with the helium drives leaking or becoming an issue as they aged but so far that hasn't happened.",

Currently using the WD Elements 6TB but it's almost full. Speed of this drive is enough for me, I never had issues regarding performance. I was thinking to get another WD Elements 16TB but, the thing is I dont' like to have my big hard drives on the table where I might bump into it while it's on. Also, these drives needs an ac adapter to work, if I get a 3rd or 4th one I would literally need a dedicated power cable for those. I know that the best option for me to get a NAS System but I don't have the budget for that right now. So I need an alternative, a hard drive that is 10TB or more, to put inside of my desktop computer that I can edit/store videos.",

Just stuffing all your data on a single large drive easily leads to catastrophic data loss. So get at least 2 drives. One for the primary copy, and one for the backup. E.g. you can get one internal one for the \"hot\" storage and one external one for the \"cold\" storage mirror. This is not ideal (look up the 3-2-1 concept for that), but if you're on a budget that's better than nothing.",

It's not dependent on hardware or software RAID (even worse situation if a hardware RAID requires specific hardware), you can have the drives physically connected on different hosts or ports or chassis, whatever, the drives can be separated if necessary. For windows, robocopy can check for changes to sync out of hundreds of thousands of files within seconds, so it doesn't even take that long and can simply be scheduled. There's a tool called \"Easy Robocopy\" to help build the command.

Synology has been using btrfs for its default filesystem for over a decade for x86 based NAS models, and recently has btrfs for all NAS offerings, even the ARM models. The biggest reason why I prefer btrfs over ext4 is bit-rot checking. I can do a btrfs scrub start /path/to/data, wait until it checks all used space, maybe run a btrfs scrub status /path/to/data to see how things are in progress, and have assurance that the data written hasn't been damaged. Another reason is compression and deduplication. This isn't relevant if using it for something like Kopia, but for a general filesystem for a file server, it can greatly help things. btrfs uses offline deduplication with duperemove, and even though it may not be as good as ZFS, it doesn't require the RAM overhead that an always-on deduplication system needs. For long term storage of data, I'd definitely go with btrfs, just because of the bitrot checking. It may not be able to repair the damage if it finds some, but at least you know that it is there.",

    "post_content": "Hi everyone\nI have a large database of photos (over 50 years of old family photos scanned from analog film) and I'm looking for good storage solutions. I would like to keep the highest quality original scan files, but this already results in >6TB of images. In addition, I would like to store a compressed version of each image (currently, these are shared via PhotoView with the family), and various edited versions (removing dust and scratches from the scans, color correction, etc). This basically means I'm searching for a system which can store tens of thousands of images, various versions of each image at different resolutions and compressions, meta-data and album structures.\nThis does not need to be a hosted, always available solution. I'm happy if I can create an export or similar, e.g. of all compressed images, which can then be loaded into PhotoView, Immich, PhotoPrism, Piwigo, what ever. I don't need all the raw high quality scans to be directly available.\nWhat I'm saying basically is: I'm looking more for something like an organization or archiving tool, than a photo library. Do you guys have any recommendations? Thanks!",

Sometimes several HDDs pooled to create huge filesystems, sometimes with redundancy. And use more HDDs for backups. By using unique filenames and folders you can organize your photos in meaningful ways. The most common is to use the file creation timestamp as a filename prefix. That allows you to group files in folders by year and month. For scanned files that will be scanned timestamp. That allows you organize the photos by scanned batches, possibly photo album order. You may want to add a album name prefix before the timestamp prefix for scanned photos. You can even create text files with the same name as the photo, with a description. The point being that all photos this way becomes unique and ordered by the timestamp. If you process some photos, add a description of the processing as a suffix and keep the prefix. For example scaling, enhance, color correction, grayscale, crop, sharpening and so on. Then you can still very easily refer back to the original photo. The original photo can be stored, perhaps read-only, along with the edited versions. You can create scaled and enhanced photos intended for browsing and giving away. By searching your photo repository you can copy groups of photos to other media. Possibly you may even create digital \"albums\" as PDF, cbz or other formats, perhaps nicely laid out, combining text and image. Even video \"slide shows\" with voice-over talking about each photo.

It's faster on both writes and reads, because you don't have to calculate parity - you just have multiple copies of the data. RAID5 or 6 put data on a couple of disks, and then have one (or more) drives dedicated for parity data. That parity data has to be calculated (takes CPU power and time) and then every single disk in the system needs a write. This is why these two will give faster reads, but no faster (possibly slower) writes than a single drive. Now, obviously these raid versions aren't useless, and for home use having the ability to lose a single drive might be enough. The one concern with these is that restoring the array after a drive fails or it has to rebuild the array puts a ton of pressure on all drives, so it's not unheard of for there to be a second drive fail.

The contents are stored in a local on-premise server with a replication factor of 2. However, my plan is to keep an offsite backup. The total content is around 30TB and will increase with time at the rate of 3-4TB/ year.\nMy questions :\nWhat kind of backup solution should I look for? I am looking at Backblaze B2 for now.\nI don't have to retrieve the data. The only time I have to retrieve is if the onpremise server goes down.",

Backblaze B2 is pretty good for this, at a cost of $6 per TB per month it's relatively cheap for what amounts to \"hot\" (always available) access to off-site backups. For your use case something like Amazon Glacier to Azure Archive blob storage might save you some money. These are basically cold cloud storage, write-once-never-read, stuff you need to keep but will probably never access.

Once that is setup I would then look at replicating the backup to an offsite service. Because the amount of data is so large along with the excellent suggestions for service allready made I would explore co-locating something. At your growth rate, a 45 drives system rack mounted somewhere that you can yourself or have the co-location service add drives to might be more cost effective espeically 5 or 8 years forrom now when you more than doubled your data size.",

Alternatively, one could buy refurbished hard disks, split the data across a few of those, and have multiple sets, then take them offsite and onsite in a GFS (grandfather-father-son) configuration. The advantage of this offline method is that it takes a long time to restore from a cloud provider, probably longer than driving to where the offsite stuff is kept, fetching the most recent drive set, bringing it back, plugging in, and restoring. The trick is to bring in new media, and always, check all media every so often. If a set goes bad, set it aside. This way, because stuff is checked, you won't run into any unpleasant surprised if a drive is bad when you do a restore, and with multiple offsite sets of drives, if there are errors with one set, another set should be clean.",

I ran into a location in South Carolina that had taken nearly 1.5 terabyte's worth of pictures, and were running low on the 2TB drive of that server.\nhttps://sourceforge.net/projects/icompress/ was able to compress things down to a couple hundred gigabytes. I now run that tool monthly on systems, and have it target anything larger than 2MB. Works great.\nUnfortunately, the Chicago location doesn't do what everyone else is doing. That's an issue for management to fix, which hasn't happened. In the mean time I'm stuck with them using nearly 3TB out of the 4TB they've been alotted because they're walking around taking video instead of pictures of whatever's important.\nWhile I'd definitely prefer to just have them get an external drive, move the files, and ignore it, we're expected to be taking and maintaining backups of things.\nIs there a tool that can do what the Mass Image Compressor is doing? I give it a folder, and it goes through and compresses the AVIs? I know I won't get near the return that I do for pictures, but there are thousands of videos that I'm having to deal with. I'm not looking to maintain 4k video or something...the videos are mostly a walkaround of a vehicle, and focusing on some placard that gives details like serial numbers and stuff. All stuff that would be better suited to pictures, but that's a separate issue.",

These changes are what killed pushshift.io (full reddit archives and searchable api used by mods and many research/academic papers) and what will kill most (if not all) third-party reddit clients. This is obviously a detriment to everyone, and while Reddit will almost certainly go through with these changes regardless, thousands of subreddits are going to be participating in a 2-day (or longer) blackout. You can read more about the blackouts at r/ModCoord. At the very least, the planned blackout seems to have convinced Reddit to give free API access to accessibility clients. Hopefully it can change their minds further.\nr/DataHoarder will be locked for an undetermined amount of time, see this thread for reddit data archives, tools, etc. we will also be using this time to update our sidebar links and do some general maintenance in the hopes that this mess doesn't mean the end for us and the many communities that see this as a killing of the Reddit we have loved over the years.\nNote; during this time no new posts can be made and all comments are black-holed.\n~ The Mod Team, ciao for now.\nTrack the blackout here: https://reddark.untone.uk",

I’ve tried a couple different things and none of them have worked.\nFandom images are all hosted on static.wikia.nocookie.net/[wiki name here]/ and I was able to find them on Wayback Machine under this domain, all being listed as image files. I put this into the Wayback Machine Downloader, however, all of these images downloaded as index.html files with a bunch of random code/text and no images. No clue why.\nSo then, I was able to find a list of image links by using http://web.archive.org/cdx/search/cdx?url=[url name here]*&output=txt. I tried to insert this list into JDownloader to download current versions, and for a smaller wiki, it worked like a charm, but for a larger one (roughly 100k links), nothing worked. I couldn’t copy and paste the links into the pop up box for links, I couldn’t drag the links, I couldn’t drag a txt file with the links— it would freeze for a second, then go on like nothing happened.\nWhere do I go from here? Any advice would be helpful. Thank you!",

Most of the stuff I have saved is media (vedios/pics) and there's really a lot of them so bulk downloading everything at once would be the best option here. I have tried downloading all the links fetched via Reddit Manager with Jdownloader but it just ignores like 70 percent of the links, because it doesn't have a built-in reddit plugin or whatever. I have also tried a few command line programs from GitHub and as someone who's not into programming, it's literally impossible to understand what is needed to be done. I mean it. There are multiple other python scripts on GitHub that have proper guides and only a couple of minutes is required to understand how to work with them. But the how-to-use guides of those reddit downloader ones are so fucking lazy...\nPlease let me know if there are any working options with GUI programs or at least a command line program that comes with a fucking usage instructions lol.",

I've attempted the windows docker desktop aio version (has issues handling external drives) and the Ubuntu manual/snap versions which have led to network and apache issues.\nI've also heard of filebrowser which seems less bloated but figure it's a similar setup situation.\nI would preferably like a setup using windows . Though I'm open to whatever as I'm slowly becoming more familiar with linux.\nRequirements:\nAccessible from any computer (phone would be useful too for photos) - \"any\" meaning Ideally I can access via a browser or something (like gdrive) and upload or download files if needed.\nCan be mounted on any computer as a local drive (Rclone)\nCan use freefilesync (either directly or via rclone/local mounts)\n*My current setup:\nI have a main desktop running Windows with several external drives used for everyday use - It's the general source/first line of any data I create/get/etc.\nI use Rclone to mount a google drive to my different computers and use freefilesync/realtimesync to automate uploading/updating to the gdrive as a backup and so I can free up storage on the main computer.\nThen I have another Windows desktop at another location with a DAS that uses freefilesync to download the folders from gdrive for extra backup.\nI would like to set something up on an unused miniPC that I have with usb3 external DAS to replace the gdrive step in my data flow. This miniPC can be used exclusively for this cloud replacement if needed.\nI do not want to pay for a different cloud service and I am looking for a free/non subscription based setup using my own local hardware.\nAppreciate you reading through this!",

It's a QNAP TS-h2490FU with 24x16TB SSDs\nThe server is to be used for an onsite project for 3 weeks. It will then come back to our building and be used as a server for active projects. Redundancy is pretty critical for us but we will also be making backups constantly. Seems like RAID 50 or 60 might be best but I'd like some input if anyone has recommendations. Thanks!",

Assuming you're using TrueNAS? Running a RAID 60 (a pair of striped 12x RAID Z2) would be pushing the recommended limits of dual RAID 6 arrays with 12 disks per array, but it would give you the most capacity with good redundancy at 320TB usable (10x16TB usable per RAID 6 = 160TB * 2 arrays = 320TB) For best reliability and performance, use 12 vdevs of mirrored pairs for 192TB.

    "post_content": "2020-04-15 update: the-eye.eu is temporarily down, but the de-centralized Interplanetary File System (IPFS) link remains up.\nNote, publishers have made most Coronavirus articles free as of March 6th 2020.\nVisit r/libgen and r/scihub to join the open science revolution.\nAccess\nArticle listing / Links\nOpen Directory\nFull-text Search\nTorrent\nInterPlanetary File System\nInformation\nIn a 2015 New York Times op-ed the chief medical officer of Liberia argued that the Ebola pandemic responsible for the loss of over 2,200 lives could have been prevented if not for a paywall blocking access to an article from 1982. Dividing the world’s scientists with a paywall in the middle of a global humanitarian crisis is an unacceptable and unforgivable act of criminal greed. In the developing world the price for a single article can amount to as much as half a week’s salary for a physician. A few days ago, I found an early-release coronavirus article with a $35.95 access fee for non-subscribers. The fury I felt brought tears to my eyes.\nMe and a few friends share that fury, so we gathered a collection of five-thousand scientific studies covering any article title containing “coronav*” from 1968-2020. The scope of the papers spans not only the 7 human coronaviruses, but up to 40 other Coronaviridae family strains. The Ebola virus showed us that every study counts. We are on the first step towards compiling a complete open-access Coronaviridae research catalog for the world’s scientists, journalists, and virology experts to draw from to fight the virus and save lives.\nOur project is illegal, but it’s the right thing to do in this crisis. We refuse to put copyright before human lives. Sharing everything we know about the virus is essential, which is why international scientists are openly sharing their coronavirus findings in an unprecedented way. Developing-world scientists often work without article access due to complex and expensive contract agreements between publishers, universities, and hospitals, relying on overseas colleagues to help them hunt down PDF files. The virus is not going to wait for this, so we need to act with conviction, now.\nTo their credit, publishers made a few dozen papers open-access in the last few days, which you can find over at Elsevier’s Novel Coronavirus Information Center and Wiley’s Coronavirus collection. While Wiley is slating to shut down their collection in April, our collection won’t be shutting down anytime soon. We’re going to keep growing to help our scientists out, and you can help us complete the catalog by identifying any papers we missed. All extant Coronaviridae research, accessible in seconds, by any scientist in the world. It’s the least we can do to help.\nMethodology\nHow did we do it?\nWe scanned Sci-Hub's 80 million title collection for the coronavirus, then we extracted the titles and Digital Object Identifiers (DOI) to an index, and exported the PDF files to upload them to The-Eye.eu’s full-text search repository.\nHow can I help?\nWe always need developers. You can also help us identify new articles by joining our team spreadsheet here. Request access and you can begin adding new article titles to the list. You can also help share word of the collection with the scientific community by reaching out to journalists.\nWho is helping us?\nOur brave host is The-Eye.eu, a “non-profit, community driven platform dedicated to the archiving and long-term preservation of any and all data,” making this project just one of the many public access preservation projects they stand behind. You can aid projects like this one by donating toward their server bills.\nA thank you to Sci-Hub and Library Genesis.\nLast year communities across reddit (including r/seedboxes and r/DataHoarder) came together in a mission to secure and preserve Sci-Hub and Library Genesis, collectively the two largest free and open non-profit library collections in the world: Sci-Hub’s 80-million scientific article database that made this project possible, and LibGen’s 2.5-million scientific-book collection. The libraries fulfill United Nations world development goals mandating the removal of restrictions on access to science, and they serve developing world doctors, academic researchers, and other experts in society with the knowledge they need to build a better world. Keeping these libraries open and thriving means saving lives, educating the world, and providing invaluable science to humanity’s global experts.\nThank you to everyone involved in the project, The-Eye.eu for their support, and to all the scientists around the world working on behalf of humanity today.",

Without them pissing me off with these high prices, i would have never built this beautiful machine.\nMy next steps will be updating the hardware. Im lacking when it comes down to my memory. Only running 16gb ddr3 non-ecc ram. My processor isnt where it should be. Im severly limiting the speed on my hard drive disks since theyre tied into a pcie 2.0 x1 port. Im happy i get 6 sata connectors right off the board but i have 12 drives in this case. Lots of stuff going on so these upgrades gotta wait but this was a really fun project for the time being.

Update 11: I keep getting a lot of DMs about saving certain sfw subs, so I'll shout this :3 I'M SAVING THE CONTENT OF EVERY IMGUR LINK POSTED TO REDDIT, ALL OF THEM. The talk of nsfw items is due to wanting to archive those subs in place too (make consumable). We have reddits full submission and comment history data and with this project we will have all the imgur media which will allow us to re-build whole subreddits into static portable/browsable archives. There's a lot of work to do in the coming weeks to make sense of this data but rest assured between myself and ArchiveTeam we will have grabbed every imgur link on reddit. AT is working from multiple sources of once public links and at the time of my writing this has grabbed 67TB. My reddit sourced data so far is 52TB while my 7char id crawlers output is coming up on 642TB (crawler running on and off since this post) Note that I'm downloading media only while AT is downloading html pages/media as warc for ingest into the wayback machine. -------- 18 DMs and counting... I'll revisit this and rehost everything I have as well as catch up on the last 3 years. Will update on progress later. ----- > https://www.reddit.com/r/DataHoarder/comments/djxy8v/imgur_has_recently_changed_its_policies_regarding/f4a82xr/ --------- **Update 1:** Keep an eye on this repo if you want to help archive imgur general for input into the wayback machine. > https://github.com/ArchiveTeam/imgur-grab I'm currently restoring what I pulled in the last dump (all reddit sourced) and scraping urls posted to reddit since. Downloads will begin in next 12 hours. --------------- **Update 2:** Downloads started, servers go [zoom! zoom!](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/534870962475368451/1098937457686347787/zoomzoom.png) ~ ~~Output directory will be rehosted later today.~~ ----------- **Update 3:** Waiting on IP block to be assigned to speed things up and avoid rate limits, still avg 400-500MB/s hoping to hit 20Gbit/s at least. --------------- **Update 4:** Downloads are going steady with new IPs, maintained 9Gbit/s* for the last few hours but I'm hitting some limitations of my downloader so if you're proficient in `C++` get in touch <3 ----------- **Update 5:** [Heh ...](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/534870962475368451/1099293595007193218/classicimgur.png) still over 8Gbit/s ... ---------- **Update 6:** Not a great deal new to report, worked out a few kinks in my downloader so things are smoother but I'm still only averaging 9Gbit/s or so. That's likely all I'm going to get unless I up thread count and pass any 429s to another IP or look into load balancing properly. For the nsfw subs I'm going to make a master list from these two `redditlist.com/nsfw` & `old.reddit.com/r/NSFW411/wiki/index`, so if you're an nsfw sub owner that wants your sub archiving and you're not on those lists let me know. I'm downloading all imgur content first but once it's done I'll start putting things together into individual sub archives as a new project. I'm on the road for the next few days so maybe sparse to no updates while I'm afd. ----------- **Update 7:** Moved from singles to albums, much more involved process (to api or not to api, eww api) but still going smoothly!! Some trivia, their 5 character space is 916,132,832 IDs... that's _nine hundred sixteen million one hundred thirty-two thousand eight hundred thirty-two_ potential images, obviously many in that space are dead today but they now use the 7 character space. --------- **Update 8:** imgur dls are fine, this is a rant about reddit archiving tools.... they're all broken or useless for mass archiving. Here's the problem, they ALL adhere to reddits api limit which makes them pointless for full sub preservation (you can only get the last 1000 posts) OR they actually use something like the pushshift API which would be nice if it wasn't broken, missing data or rate limited to fuck when online. We have the reddit data and we can download all the media from imgur and the other media hosts..... So we have all the raw data, it's safe it's gravy! but we have nothing at all to tie everything together and output nice little neat consumable archives of subs. This wasn't the case 4-6 years ago, there was soooo many workable tools, now they're all DEAD! So what needs to be done? [reddit-html-archiver](https://github.com/libertysoft3/reddit-html-archiver) was the damn tits!! and needs rewriting to support using the raw json data as a source and not the ps api this way everything can be built offline and then rehosted, repackaged and shared!!. It then needs extending to support the mirroring of linked media AND to include flags to support media already downloaded like in the case of what we're doing with imgur. This would only be a start on slapping some sense into mirroring reddit and getting consumable archives into the hands of users..... I'll write up something more cohesive and less ranty when I'm done with imgur. (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻ -------------- **Update 9:** AT has the warrior project running now, switch to it manually in your warrior or run the docker/standalone. > https://github.com/ArchiveTeam/imgur-grab > https://tracker.archiveteam.org/imgur/ Content archived in the AT project will only be available via the wayback machine. ---------------- **Update 10:** Coming to a close on the links I have available so I'm now taking stock, running `file` and crawling both id spaces to check for replaced/reused in the 5 and all new in the 7.",

And if you can't, not a big problem. A microscopic hole makes helium leak faster? Well it leaks anyways but now it kind of sucks your drive's lifespan is shorter. Internal frame is bent? Well, now that's a paperweight, your heads no longer align with the platters and there is nothing you can do to fix it without paying more than the drive's worth.

We send this automated warning message when a 100G or 1T user uses more than 6 TB of bandwidth. But it’s just a warning, we don’t take any actions unless we think that the user is sharing their account with way too many people. For example, 5 is okay. 50 is not. :) This is also a check to see if the user is aware of the bw usage - in cases of faulty download manager settings for example. I should also mention that 10T users don’t receive this message because 6 TB of bandwidth is in no way realistic for these users, we know that. 👀 And u/MidnightLink if you reply to the email you received, I would be more than happy to look into this for you if you think something’s wrong. 💛",

I've attempted the windows docker desktop aio version (has issues handling external drives) and the Ubuntu manual/snap versions which have led to network and apache issues.\nI've also heard of filebrowser which seems less bloated but figure it's a similar setup situation.\nI would preferably like a setup using windows . Though I'm open to whatever as I'm slowly becoming more familiar with linux.\nRequirements:\nAccessible from any computer (phone would be useful too for photos) - \"any\" meaning Ideally I can access via a browser or something (like gdrive) and upload or download files if needed.\nCan be mounted on any computer as a local drive (Rclone)\nCan use freefilesync (either directly or via rclone/local mounts)\n*My current setup:\nI have a main desktop running Windows with several external drives used for everyday use - It's the general source/first line of any data I create/get/etc.\nI use Rclone to mount a google drive to my different computers and use freefilesync/realtimesync to automate uploading/updating to the gdrive as a backup and so I can free up storage on the main computer.\nThen I have another Windows desktop at another location with a DAS that uses freefilesync to download the folders from gdrive for extra backup.\nI would like to set something up on an unused miniPC that I have with usb3 external DAS to replace the gdrive step in my data flow. This miniPC can be used exclusively for this cloud replacement if needed.\nI do not want to pay for a different cloud service and I am looking for a free/non subscription based setup using my own local hardware.\nAppreciate you reading through this!",

Not all that easy but still rather cheap. Then you have to build a prototype in a lab. This can be pretty tricky, but as long as your idea is sound, you likely can just throw a bit of money around and make it work. And you can get away creating something mostly impractical and just scale up your numbers etc. At this point, media will often write some pretty fantastical articles how this breakthrough will change the world. However, the most important, difficult and often very expensive step is the last: Devising a production method, material, and supply line that can transforms the idea into a cheap, mass producible and end user friendly product. And here tons of ideas break apart. Making the protype out of pure gold might be fine, but for the end product you have to make it work with a gold coating. Scratch that, to stay competitive you have to make it out of copper. And that special centrifuge you used to create this gel you use? You either have to find a way to make this using a normal mixing plant, or somehow find someone willing to invest like a billion dollars into developing a much larger version of that centrifuge. Oh, and you have to make the product much more sturdy, otherwise consumers will break it all the time. And no, you cannot make people take a 3 week course just to learn how to handle your product. You have to make it idiotproof. All while keeping costs low. TLDR: Until you can buy it for a reasonable price, just ignore videos like this.",
