I've ran scans and I don't even have anything on my computer other than 2 games. However, every time I shut off my computer, I am unsure if it will work again because the following happens ;\nOnce I log in, none of the apps start up (like wallpaper engine)\nI cannot run commands, or open any app at all other than my files in general. No matter how many times I click an app it won't run. (Along with not being able to run commands, I can't open settings, task manager, etc.)\nI cannot shut off, sleep, or restart my pc unless I hold down the physical computer's button.\nI have tried everything to fix this. At this point I have wiped my computer a total of 3 times and reinstalled everything. I reinstall the games from the microsoft store as well so I have no clue if I could've downloaded any sort of virus ? I'm sure I haven't.\nOnce I reset my computer, it works again. And because I fear of this happening again, nowadays I put my computer to sleep instead of actually shutting it off. Once I interact with it again and it's not asleep anymore, it still works ... ? ?\nI'm just lost, how do I fix this ? Should I take my computer checked by a professional , is this a computer itself problem or is Windows 11 the reason ? Please help me :( (quick thing to note if it helps; one time when my computer did this it managed to run using kernel debugging however I couldn't open apps I needed while running it and upon turning it off my computer went back to being this way)",

This doesn't sound like you've got nothing on the computer.\nI would troubelshoot by starting with a clean install of Windows 11. Either a factory reset that removes your user files or a fresh install from new media like a USB stick created with the Windows 11 Media Creation Tool (https://www.microsoft.com/en-ca/software-download/windows11). Then, I would see if the computer exhibits the problem. E.g. can you shut off, sleep, or restart the PC normally?\nIf so, then I would install programs one at a time and test the problem after each program to see if the problem returns.\nThe problem as you've described does not sound like virus behavior so that might be some comfort.",

            "content": "There are IMO two main things going on (and a few smaller ones, but those for another post maybe).\nOne is that marketing teams and devs gotta justify their existence, there always has to be something to be 'improved' or they lose their jobs. Whether things really need 'improving' does not matter, the only thing that matters is they keep making money by constant change, even 'perfect' can never be admitted to be perfect.\nAnother is that many companies are pulling features or forcing usage of free features that were not pushed before, AKA: enshitification.\nThe reason for pulling features or pulling parts of those features like:\nTaking away customization options or hiding them.\nHiding useful menus (or making them ugly/difficult to use) so that later they can say: \"no one uses these features, so we are simplifying things by removing them!\".\nShutting down windows backup, then forcing them to OneDrive. Part of this though is to get people using OneDrive where people will of course start to fill it up and thus need to pay for an upgrade... or later down the road take away the free part, forcing people to pay.\nPushing the snipping tool, which is irritating at the least, now you have to do things like drag or click things just for your picture, no more just clicking 'print screen' and knowing your pic is in the screenshots folder that you can go get later when it is convenient.\nFor Google, just to pick on someone else for a moment: It is things like now it will not turn on the speakerphone when you ask it to when making a call or deciding that now after a recent update the assistant cannot even skip a song or set a reminder/alarm when you do not have cell signal.\nFor many of the base features that these services had, the various companies will then down the road offer \"Windows Plus\", \"Windows Media Edition\", Google+ or the like or simply push people into the paid version of their products that already exist.\nWithin 5-10 years this will shift a bit into pushing everyone off of hardware machines with installed software, you will use your phone or a new version of a dumb client that you have to rent all software for in packs or plans that are reminiscent to cable TV packs...\nWant Office?\nYou need to pay for Windows per month and the Plus pack that gives you more comprehensive menus, ability to take screenshots, has \"handy utilities\" such as notepad, calculator, and more!\", these are the prereqs to have the productivity pack, which is a base version of MS Office (of course with further upgrades available for a fee).\nOh, you also want games? pick one of our 5 packs/tiers for different games! (of course all the best games will be in diff tiers/packs, and the pack you pay for also comes with a bunch of crap).\nDon't forget the Social media pack!\nAnd especially don't forget to add how much storage you want to rent, running out when doing that big business project or when in that big game would be devastating, but never fear, we allow you to upgrade it on the fly in case you fill it up!\nForget to pay your bill? \"Sorry, it appears your payment did not go through, this machine will not allow any activity other than paying your bill.\"\nYes, what I did with the product names was intentional...\nEdit: OneDrive, not OneNote, lol",
