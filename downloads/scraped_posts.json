I've had all the negatives I could find scanned and would love a semi-automated way to find the few photos in the piles of prints for which I was missing negatives. Passing the prints through a fast scanner with a feeder would be much less onerous than manually matching them up.\nLast time I looked for such a thing was approx 10 years ago and I remember not being very impressed, so any suggestions would be very much appreciated.",

I will thus no longer be updating this archive. The MEGA will remain untouched, so use that as you please, but that will likely die one day as there is a bandwidth/transfer limit. I will be uploading the content to Internet Archive, as well as other sources, but until then the torrent magnet that I will be seeding for a little while is listed below - my bandwidth isn't the best

If you hoarded data, the fbi may be interested in what you have: https://www.reddit.com/r/DataHoarder/comments/ksfel0/did_you_hoard_social_media_yesterday/ Go take politics to r/politics, whatever left/right/center sub, or parler, whichever is your thing.

    "media": [],
    "post_content": "Hi! To preface, sorry for the extremely long post, if you'd like to just give some information about one small thing feel free as I will appreciate anything.\nI used to be into PC gaming but due to some unfortunate life circumstances I have managed to kick the habit entirely. Now I have a very fancy paperweight of regret staring at me daily.\nI have a plex server running on windows off of my previous gaming PC, though it's full with a measly 4TB and the case cannot fit any drives, I've been waiting to re-build it in a new case, using unraid and some actual big drives, then it struck me I could possibly re-use some parts from both machines to build what I want and sell the rest since I have no desire to game anymore.\nI'm a bit stuck on whether this is a good idea or not though. I don't know if it would be financially better to sell all of it and begin again? Bearing in mind I'll be selling the things cheap for an easy sale - I'm really not great at handling interactions like this so I let them go relatively cheap and hassle free usually.\nAnyway enough rambling, the parts I have to re-use or sell are:\nprevious pc:\nCPU: i9-9900k\nCPU Cooler: Some form of AIO\nMotherboard: Z390 Aorus master\nRam: Corsair 32GB DDR4-3200 (4x 8GB sticks, RGB lighting so I guess I could sell them for more?)\nGPU: 2080ti (Can this be used for any potential VM applications if I want to run beefier programs remotely or something from a laptop?)\nPSU: Can't remember and can't get to the pc, think it was some non modular bronze corsair one\ncurrent PC:\nCPU: i9-13900k\nCPU cooler: Lian li AIO\nMotherboard: ROG Maximus Z790 hero\nRam: Corsair 32GB DDR5-5600 (2x 16GB sticks, RGB lighting again)\nGPU: Already sold\nPSU: Some modular thermaltake atx 3.0 gold PSU\nFrom both:\nStorage: A variety of 1TB/2TB M.2 SSD's, can I use these in the Raid setup? Can I put the actual OS on them or is there no benefit for a NAS? I think there's even some 2.5\" Ones also\nMore storage: A variety of older, random sized HDD's 1TB, 2TB, 4TB etc. Can I use these with my new ones I'll be getting or am I better off not doing that?\nSo the form factor will possibly play into what I do, if I want it to be a small machine then I have no choice but to sell the motherboard to get a smaller one to fit one of the CPU's, but if I do that am I better off downgrading the CPU and just sell both MOBO+CPU as combos together? I'm also a bit concerned about a smaller MOBO in general since the selection seems to be very limited\nCase wise I've been eyeing up these\nNode 304/804: These seem to be one of the \"old reliables\", but as most I was disappointed by the outdated I/O and on the 304 worry about temperatures. I'd rather lose some space (or.. gain?) and know the temps will be alright",

            "content": "Using a high end CPU in a mostly storage and media NAS will be a huge waste of power. Especially if you have no specific use case that needs performance, just \"maybe i'll want to do something else\", the reasonable thing is to just get some low or mid tier CPU at the most. Make sure you get an integrated GPU, iGPUs in even lower tier intel chips are amazing at transcoding which will be a huge help for media servers and it'll be very power efficient doing so. As for drives, depends on if you plan to expand? Personally went with 2x18TB drives to begin with, specifically to expand, and it's up to 4x18TB now. Higher capacity drive means higher max capacity for a given number of slots, so good expandability, plus they're more power efficient per TB. a 10TB disk uses the same power as a 20TB. So 2x20TB with one parity disk is a totally reasonable setup for that reason. You should still keep separate backups for important data to be clear, because you always should, but yeah."

Using a NAS drive instead of a desktop drive in your PC won't pose configuration issues; it will function well. NAS drives are built for 24/7 operation, but check the specifications to ensure they can handle daily power cycling based on usage.

The main differences with NAS drives are: They're designed to compensate for vibration from several other drives in the same chassis. There probably aren't any other drives in your PC, so this wouldn't even come into play, but if there are, this is a positive thing. They're designed to return a read error quickly when data is corrupted, without going to great lengths to recover it, on the assumption that it's part of a RAID array and the data can be recovered from another device. If it took a very long time to respond with the read error, the array might decide the whole drive has failed and degrade the pool. Desktop hard drives will work much harder, and take much longer, to try to recover unreadable data, but the result is usually the same anyway. So while this is a negative for desktop use, it's a pretty minor one, imo, and only comes into play when the drive is failing. Good backups make this a non-issue."

SAS NAS drives - not unless you have a SAS controller. SAS Controllers can run SAS and/or SATA drives under the provision that you DO NOT mix drives in array. SATA controllers can only control SATA drives and a SAS drive will absolutely NOT work on a SATA controller. Where possible when selecting a NAS drive to use in your PC check the specifications and make sure that it is a CMR Conventional Magnetic Recording and not an SMR Shingled Magnetic Recording drive. The difference is that the CMR drive leaves small gaps between blocks whereas the SMR overwrites blocks slightly and if you have an SMR drive that is writing to a block say five levels down the stack then it has to write also at the 4th level down, 3rd level down, 2nd level down and top level to maintain the required level for storing data. This can have an effect on speed and thus SMR drives should be used where you are going to write a lot of data once and then read it repeatedly I.E its an archival drive, not really best in a PC desktop.

The SSD had been corrupted by the motherboard in its death throes, apparently. Even though the entire partition was there and even most of the LUKS header was there and could be seen using cryptsetup luksDump /dev/sda5, the key was not available. Reading up, I learned that LUKS-encrypted hard drives have no redundancy or protection from any kind of corruption, and this is by design/laziness, claimed to be in the interests of security, to quote the cryptsetup man page: LUKS header: If the header of a LUKS volume gets damaged, all data is permanently lost unless you have a header-backup. If a key-slot is damaged, it can only be restored from a header-backup or if another active key-slot with known passphrase is undamaged. Damaging the LUKS header is something people manage to do with surprising frequency. This risk is the result of a trade-off between security and safety, as LUKS is designed for fast and secure wiping by just overwriting header and key-slot area. (‚ÄúDid you just tell me to go f‚Äîk myself?‚Äù ‚ÄúI believe I did, Bob.‚Äù) This is BS because the security rationale makes no sense (how many milliseconds would it take to erase a second header stored elsewhere on the partition? has anyone ever in the history of the world been saved from law enforcement or hackers because there was only one header rather than two?); I suspect the real reason is that the maintainer admits in bug reports that the current LUKS format doesn‚Äôt allow for multiple copies (1‚Å†, 2), and this is just them engaging in sour grapes about how It‚Äôs Actually A Good Thing. I can safely say I had no idea whatsoever that Linux encrypted drives were this fragile and permanent data loss so trivial, or that we are expected to do things like sudo cryptsetup luksHeaderBackup /dev/sda5 --header-backup-file luks-header.bin.crypt if we want to avoid it. Such fragility is itself deeply counter to security as it strongly encourages users to not use encryption at all: they have to choose whether to be mugged by bitflips or by the FBI. What a choice. A lesson is learned but the damage is irreversible."

    "media": [],
    "post_content": "Hi! To preface, sorry for the extremely long post, if you'd like to just give some information about one small thing feel free as I will appreciate anything.\nI used to be into PC gaming but due to some unfortunate life circumstances I have managed to kick the habit entirely. Now I have a very fancy paperweight of regret staring at me daily.\nI have a plex server running on windows off of my previous gaming PC, though it's full with a measly 4TB and the case cannot fit any drives, I've been waiting to re-build it in a new case, using unraid and some actual big drives, then it struck me I could possibly re-use some parts from both machines to build what I want and sell the rest since I have no desire to game anymore.\nI'm a bit stuck on whether this is a good idea or not though. I don't know if it would be financially better to sell all of it and begin again? Bearing in mind I'll be selling the things cheap for an easy sale - I'm really not great at handling interactions like this so I let them go relatively cheap and hassle free usually.\nAnyway enough rambling, the parts I have to re-use or sell are:\nprevious pc:\nCPU: i9-9900k\nCPU Cooler: Some form of AIO\nMotherboard: Z390 Aorus master\nRam: Corsair 32GB DDR4-3200 (4x 8GB sticks, RGB lighting so I guess I could sell them for more?)\nGPU: 2080ti (Can this be used for any potential VM applications if I want to run beefier programs remotely or something from a laptop?)\nPSU: Can't remember and can't get to the pc, think it was some non modular bronze corsair one\ncurrent PC:\nCPU: i9-13900k\nCPU cooler: Lian li AIO\nMotherboard: ROG Maximus Z790 hero\nRam: Corsair 32GB DDR5-5600 (2x 16GB sticks, RGB lighting again)\nGPU: Already sold\nPSU: Some modular thermaltake atx 3.0 gold PSU\nFrom both:\nStorage: A variety of 1TB/2TB M.2 SSD's, can I use these in the Raid setup? Can I put the actual OS on them or is there no benefit for a NAS? I think there's even some 2.5\" Ones also\nMore storage: A variety of older, random sized HDD's 1TB, 2TB, 4TB etc. Can I use these with my new ones I'll be getting or am I better off not doing that?\nSo the form factor will possibly play into what I do, if I want it to be a small machine then I have no choice but to sell the motherboard to get a smaller one to fit one of the CPU's, but if I do that am I better off downgrading the CPU and just sell both MOBO+CPU as combos together? I'm also a bit concerned about a smaller MOBO in general since the selection seems to be very limited\nCase wise I've been eyeing up these\nNode 304/804: These seem to be one of the \"old reliables\", but as most I was disappointed by the outdated I/O and on the 304 worry about temperatures. I'd rather lose some space (or.. gain?) and know the temps will be alright",

            "content": "Using a high end CPU in a mostly storage and media NAS will be a huge waste of power. Especially if you have no specific use case that needs performance, just \"maybe i'll want to do something else\", the reasonable thing is to just get some low or mid tier CPU at the most. Make sure you get an integrated GPU, iGPUs in even lower tier intel chips are amazing at transcoding which will be a huge help for media servers and it'll be very power efficient doing so. As for drives, depends on if you plan to expand? Personally went with 2x18TB drives to begin with, specifically to expand, and it's up to 4x18TB now. Higher capacity drive means higher max capacity for a given number of slots, so good expandability, plus they're more power efficient per TB. a 10TB disk uses the same power as a 20TB. So 2x20TB with one parity disk is a totally reasonable setup for that reason. You should still keep separate backups for important data to be clear, because you always should, but yeah."

While you work, current AV will monitor the file and probably catch infected ones. Once you sorted files to multiple folders, scan them all once more with OS AV software, and download multiple offline scanners - there are more than few available. Scan with them, too.

Microsoft is playing nice and has all their games available on Steam and even many ESG exclusives turned out to be timed exclusives. Hell, these days you got Playstation exclusives coming out on Steam, as an actual regular thing. I'm not saying that all is perfect. But you know... It has been worse. I don't know how Valve managed to succeed (with their endless apathy) where Netflix has failed. But it does seem like they have been able to stop the trend of publishers pulling their content off of Steam. Maybe the fact that they can't actually remove already-purchased games from your library helps there. If a publisher leaves Netflix, anyone who was consuming that content must move to the new service to continue watching. But on Steam, you can just keep playing. You're not really motivated to move to the new platform at all, and any new content exclusively on that new launcher can easily be missed. Funny how that works.",

Also, these drives needs an ac adapter to work, if I get a 3rd or 4th one I would literally need a dedicated power cable for those.

Just stuffing all your data on a single large drive easily leads to catastrophic data loss. So get at least 2 drives. One for the primary copy, and one for the backup. E.g. you can get one internal one for the \"hot\" storage and one external one for the \"cold\" storage mirror. This is not ideal (look up the 3-2-1 concept for that), but if you're on a budget that's better than nothing.",
