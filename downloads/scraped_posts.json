It really bothers me that dugin is so associated with neo-fascism, especially since I’ve heard him renounce fascism and racism several times. This perception tho I think harms it catching on in the western world even more so than it’s opposition to liberalism"

Many quote him, but he specifically rallied against racism and totalitarianism in his book. It’s just he uses post-modern theory in a traditionalist context, so it’s something Neo-nazi groups can pull on to bolster themselves. It’s about Dasein, which can be explained as a sort of cultural worldview and the human experience (typically in a more collectivist leaning manner), it’s honestly a fair bit esoteric. And he rallies against racism. Here’s a pdf of his book for further reading.",
