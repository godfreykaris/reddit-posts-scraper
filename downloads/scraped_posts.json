The Antec P101 is also interesting.\nEdit: I reuse old stuff until it dies. 4 motherboards died in the past 6 months, so I'm going to get some new ones and bump some stuff down.

            "content": "Using a high end CPU in a mostly storage and media NAS will be a huge waste of power. Especially if you have no specific use case that needs performance, just \"maybe i'll want to do something else\", the reasonable thing is to just get some low or mid tier CPU at the most. Make sure you get an integrated GPU, iGPUs in even lower tier intel chips are amazing at transcoding which will be a huge help for media servers and it'll be very power efficient doing so.\nAs for drives, depends on if you plan to expand? Personally went with 2x18TB drives to begin with, specifically to expand, and it's up to 4x18TB now. Higher capacity drive means higher max capacity for a given number of slots, so good expandability, plus they're more power efficient per TB. a 10TB disk uses the same power as a 20TB. So 2x20TB with one parity disk is a totally reasonable setup for that reason. You should still keep separate backups for important data to be clear, because you always should, but yeah.",
