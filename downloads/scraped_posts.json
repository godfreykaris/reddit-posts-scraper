    "post_content": "Howdy y'all, I recently downloaded all of my Twitter bookmarks and since this is year's worth of bookmarks it has resulted in around 4000 files. I would like to sort all these files into separate folders but dragging and dropping each file or small bundle of files is rather tedious and time consuming. So I am in search of tools that can help speed up this process. my first idea of something that might be helpful would be a program that uses keybinds to move files into folders. but any tool that can make this go faster would be very helpful.\nThank yall so much and have a good one",
