Same as above I have a first version but am planning on rewriting so it's easier to maintain/add new features and commands.\nCurrently working on switching the database to Postgres locally.

Also the option to decrypt the whole file should be availbale without having to select all content of the file.\nThe summary from Wikipedia works at some selections and not in others. When it is not available I see always the message that Wikipedia is not available at the moment but I don't think it is due to a network problem rather than the Wikipedia Api dont find something relevant.
