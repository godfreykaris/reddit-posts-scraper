{"Title": "Archiving ~500 raw comic books", "Author": "u/AndroidAssistant", "Content": "I'm trying to digitize my father's ~500 comic book collection before his birthday in August so he can read them on his tablet. He gifted them to me a while back because, while he wouldn't admit it, his eyes are starting to go, and he couldn't enjoy them anymore. With the tablet he can zoom in as far as needed so I know he would love to revisit the comics once they are in digital form. Everything is in pristine condition with sleeves and backers, but there is nothing insanely valuable in the collection. He has a couple that are worth something, but most sit at >$10. That said, it would crush him if any were damaged so the scanning method must be non-destructive. What I have tried: Czur Aura Pro Super quick, but random cropping and glare for days, even using the side lights. I tried using it with the official light box, outside the box, with 1-5 additional lights, with only external lights at every angle known to man, in a diffusion light box, with polarizers, etc. The only thing that worked 100% of the time was scanning while sitting on my back porch on an overcast day. I opened a ticket with their support and the response was \"Make your room light bright enough, but do not have direct light shining on the book.\". They didn't address the cropping issues. Epson Perfection V600 Epson Scan - Impressive for OEM software but inconsistent and changing the framing is a pain unless things are at perfect right angles. VueScan - Sometimes it decides just not to scan, sometimes it scans and the image is black. When it does scan it does fine, but the auto skew is ~90% accurate which may as well be 0 because I have to adjust every single picture. Silverfast - I was surprised at how much better the scans look, but the scans take 2-3 times as long as the Vue or Epson software. Also I have to take a prescan every time I move the page? At this point I'm ready to hire a service if anyone has any suggestions, but I would really prefer to do the scanning myself because I plan on at least completing the series that he has, and probably expanding on them. I do have an R10 and an M50, so I could try some sort of diybookscanner.com solution, but that is a lot of effort for something that may or may not have different results."},

I have dilemmah wich of these I should use, but maybe there's some hidden gem you could recommend? Rsync - focused with good opinion, but commands line and no idea about speed FreeFileSync - GUI, rest as above did - I know that guy, I know it's missing a bit in speed but is quite tidy and could backup everything from one to another, right?

As I work on developing a robust backup strategy for my NAS, I wonder if QNAP offers a native solution that allows splitting backups across multiple external drives automatically, without manually dividing my directories into chunks of 4 TB each. The rationale is that a 24 TB backup cannot fit on a single 4 TB external HDD. This becomes even more apparent if I expand to a usable 144 TB in the future. In that case, it would be impossible to find a single 144 TB external drive, as such drives simply do not exist.

However, having only one backup copy of my shit is not a recipe for success. Having one is as good as having none as I like to say, redundancy is crucial when it comes to hoarding my data. Important pictures are backed up, the most important of which are printed out. My consideration here is whether or not I get a high capacity internal HDD @ 7200 RPM or if I buy a high capacity portable HDD that can take abuse and is less likely to be damaged by physical adjustments and movements. This is rarely a concern in my day to day but I live in an earthquake prone area and I would agonise over losing everything to some shaking dirt. I can't do both due to financial constraints at the moment but the decision is as follows; Do I get a second external USB HDD that will be slower and have inferior transfer rates BUT be more protected in event of disaster and any other events that may happen (dog with zoomies for instance.) or Do I get a more efficient and practical internal HDD (I imagine its also cheaper) that I suspect to be significantly more fragile and susceptible to sudden movements and will likely be lost in the aforementioned events. If the internal is selected, should I acquire this before the sale ends? If I should go with an external what should I acquire? I'd like something larger than my current 5TB. I haven't used more than 1.1TB on it but I'd rather kick the can of running out of space a few more years down the road."},

This may not be technical enough for this subreddit, but it seemed like the right place to go. I'm a big fan of physical media, likely casual to most here but to my friends I am perceived as intensely pro-physical media. As such, whenever people have spare tapes, CDs, DVDs, etc etc, I'm the man they throw them at. Unfortunately, I am horribly unfamiliar with the digitization process for everything except for CDs and DVDs, and even then I occasionally have hiccups. Recently I purchased the JVC RC-EZ38S CD Portable System (link to user manual) from a flea market to play some of my tapes and CDs, and realized I had a few tapes I'm unable to find anywhere online. Usually I wouldn't worry about my tapes growing old from wear because I can download songs and save them that way, but these tapes (mostly Halloween tracks) were impossible for me to find elsewhere, so I've been trying to preserve them. The JVC product I purchased plays CDs, cassette tapes, and the radio. It has one single 3.5mm jack, a headphone output. I have done some googling, and found my best bet to save the audio is through a combination of cables and Audacity. Unfortunately, my computer only recognizes my aux cord as headphones, and I cannot treat my JVC product as a microphone when using Audacity. I have two cables - one aux with two 3.5mm ends, and one cable that has a male 3.5mm on one end and the other end has two male parts, white and yellow RCA jacks. How, if at all, can I use my JVC player to preserve the tapes I have? Is there a special cord combination I may be able to put together that won't put me out of house and home (I'm unemployed and in a somewhat difficult spot financially, even a $20 purchase has me aghast sometimes) or would I be better off looking for a different product to record my tapes? A friend of mine is currently looking to rehome an old car radio with cassette player - Do those typically have RCA plugs, and would that be a way to go about this? Anything helps, even just correcting my terms so I can communicate what I'm looking for a little better - I'm in a space where I truly don't know what it is that I don't know. I'd love to be a part of saving some lost media, even if it seems a little silly. People put work into those Halloween tapes, dammit!"},

Here's what I'm looking to do: Complete separation of storage and compute Compute consists of a handful of VMs running on Proxmox, and critically, a Kubernetes cluster The cluster is currently running in VMs but I have plans to move just about everything into the cluster and move into SFF PCs This is partially why the complete separation is important, for flexibility and future migration Here's what I have currently for equipment: Brocade switch with 48x 1gbe and 8x10gig sfp 2x 12 bay 3.5\" servers, one with Proxmox, one with TrueNAS 1x 24 bay 2.5\" server Repurposed NetApp 24x 3.5\" chassis, modified to work as DAS 4x 16gb spinners, currently in raidz1 ~32 old 2, 3, and 4gb spinners I found that K8s cluster was very unstable with my first setup, which was an iscsi target on the TrueNAS server. The iSCSI share was mounted in Proxmox with LVM to create K8s VM OS and NFS storage for containers. This got much better when I moved to a local 3x SSD zpool on the Proxmox host. I understand that the latency with spinners and over the network was likely the cause, but this doesn't allow for the separation if like. Use here is all over - media server is the main thing currently, which for transcoding needs fast seq read/writes, K8s app dev for work, and all kinds of testing containers for work and home. I'd also like to put all VM storage remote as well to play around with some different compute setups. I'd really love to be able to fully wipe Proxmox and try out XCP-ng, or Azure HCI, stuff like that... It's a lab, after all. I'm competent enough to implement a solution, but I guess not enough experience yet to design. I'm not afraid of complex setup, but I do need redundancy, particularly if putting these small drives to use as I don't trust them - came for free with the NetApp shelf. So...

I built out my homelab to learn and get a job in IT. Mission success there. I've since gotten into all kinds of stuff and have a need to rework my storage, but I'm not sure how best to set things up. Here's what I'm looking to do: Complete separation of storage and compute Compute consists of a handful of VMs running on Proxmox, and critically, a Kubernetes cluster The cluster is currently running in VMs but I have plans to move just about everything into the cluster and move into SFF PCs This is partially why the complete separation is important, for flexibility and future migration Here's what I have currently for equipment: Brocade switch with 48x 1gbe and 8x10gig sfp 2x 12 bay 3.5\" servers, one with Proxmox, one with TrueNAS 1x 24 bay 2.5\" server Repurposed NetApp 24x 3.5\" chassis, modified to work as DAS 4x 16gb spinners, currently in raidz1 ~32 old 2, 3, and 4gb spinners I found that K8s cluster was very unstable with my first setup, which was an iscsi target on the TrueNAS server. The iSCSI share was mounted in Proxmox with LVM to create K8s VM OS and NFS storage for containers. This got much better when I moved to a local 3x SSD zpool on the Proxmox host. I understand that the latency with spinners and over the network was likely the cause, but this doesn't allow for the separation if like. Use here is all over - media server is the main thing currently, which for transcoding needs fast seq read/writes, K8s app dev for work, and all kinds of testing containers for work and home. I'd also like to put all VM storage remote as well to play around with some different compute setups. I'd really love to be able to fully wipe Proxmox and try out XCP-ng, or Azure HCI, stuff like that... It's a lab, after all. I'm competent enough to implement a solution, but I guess not enough experience yet to design. I'm not afraid of complex setup, but I do need redundancy, particularly if putting these small drives to use as I don't trust them - came for free with the NetApp shelf. So... Any suggestions on how to set this up for minimal latency and fast read/write? Ceph? Mirrored ZFS using all those small spinners? Dedicated ZFS pools for each K8s node? Caching layers? Not against additional equipment, within reason, if needed."},

Using Backblaze to backup my PC + DAS. Does this setup make sense for my needs? If it does make sense, does anybody have any particular product recommendations for the DAS/JBOD and if there's any specific thing to look for in the type of drive(s) to purchase?

Does it have space to tuck one below a dual slot dual fan GPU. I know 1 3.5\" HDD can go on front panel when I use a SFX PSU. Similarly for NR200P. More suggestions are welcome. I'll use a Noctua L9i or 120 AIO as I have then lying around. I wish this post to be open for coming years so people can get ideas and inspiration from the comments."},

How many of you have had a year as bad as mine so far? 5 failures. 1 DOA Parity 1 and 2 went in January The first Replacement Drive was DOA Data Disks 5, 8 and 11 have since failed. I've been able to recover 90% of the data through the use of my backups and catching the problem in time. But seriously. 6 drives have died on me this year. And we're only half way through the year. They're dying so frequently that I can barely afford to replace them. Now. For the details. Parity Disk 2 had a physical fault of some kind. Reallocated sector counts when from 0 to 256 in one night. Parity 1 had a controller board failure (This will be a common cause. I've figured out the problem since this happened.) Data Disk 5 kicked the bucket spectacularly. The Seek Error Rate went from 85% accurate, which is the average in my server due to how many disks are in there. To 1% in the span of 3 days. Making it infuriatingly slow to get any data off the drive but still possible. Data 8 and 11 both experienced controller board failures. Strange drop outs in connection, hang ups, read and write error flags despite no data corruption either reading or writing. Obviously I couldn't trust those drives anymore. But this thing is, only 2 of these failures are genuine faults. The other 3 are my fault. The drives that had controller board failures, at least some of them, were due to how much pressure was being put on the sata connectors when I closed the side panel. Yes, I'm serious. In any other circumstance, the Define R6 would have ample room for sata power and data cables at the rear of the case. But when you have 11 drives and all their cables back there, the thickness of the noise dampening foam presses into those cables and puts dangerous amounts of pressure on the connectors. I proved this by running read checks on the \"failing drives\" with and without the side panel on. With it off, 1 drive had errors 100% of the time. With it on, all drives showed the same errors. Errors which disappeared when I removed the side panel... SMH. So now I need to replace yet more drives, the cables and the case. My server is a bottomless money pit. It has to be."},

I guess my questions are as followed: What/how many tests need to be run on a refurb drive? I've seen some posts listing multiple long tests and others just saying a few SMART tests. Is there any general consensus? Badblocks is on Linux only, would that work on something like WSL? Or would I have to get a Linux machine/VM setup? I have a Pi 3 collecting dust, could that be used? How long would testing the drives take? I've seen that a full badblocks 4 pass run can take days or even a week of 24/7 running just for one drive. Does that sound right? I was thinking about using a secondary machine like my old Thinkpad if it was going to take a week.

It seems fairly simple to rip, because each encyclopedic article has a corresponding PDF file, with the URLs only changing their final number (with 6 or 7 digits). I could produce a list of all the possible URLs in Excel. However, if I were to feed that list to a download manager, I'm wondering if that would cause any serious issues on the part of the server. There's probably close to a hundred thousand articles available on the site, and the downloader would also have to check possibly millions of URLs that contain no PDFs. Would this be like a sort of borderline DDOS attack? Could my requests be blocked? Furthermore, even if I rip all that stuff, it would result in thousands of files with nothing in particular to identify them, as the filenames are just numbers.

Now I've added an Asustor AS1102TL Drivestor 2 Lite (2 bays, 1GbE) which is probably being returned for an AS1104T Drivestor 4 (4 bays, 2,5GbE). It is supposed to be a remote NAS using Wireguard, that's why I didn't care for 1GbE, but the initial backup is taking a LONG time.

Here there's a 6Tb WD \"white label\" and an 8Tb Barracuda as single volumes (JBOD looks risky and can't use RAID with different drives). Part of my issue is which file transfer protocol to use. NFS? My desktop and laptop are Windows, not sure NFS works properly. FTP? Or SMB? SMB is giving me speed issues, not going over 150MBps and for some reason when cloning the 6Tb IronWolf to the 6Tb WD \"white label\" the speed sinks to 10MBps. It's copying RAW photos and videos, like thousands of 50-100Mb files mostly. Having file access sorted, what's your recommendation for file transfer/backup? Asustor Backup Plan? Paragon Backup and Recovery? Macrium Reflect? Or, since I already own SyncBackPro, just use that? This question is related to both, from my computers to the main NAS and main NAS to the Asustor.

How many of you have had a year as bad as mine so far? 5 failures. 1 DOA Parity 1 and 2 went in January The first Replacement Drive was DOA Data Disks 5, 8 and 11 have since failed. I've been able to recover 90% of the data through the use of my backups and catching the problem in time. But seriously. 6 drives have died on me this year. And we're only half way through the year. They're dying so frequently that I can barely afford to replace them. Now. For the details. Parity Disk 2 had a physical fault of some kind. Reallocated sector counts when from 0 to 256 in one night. Parity 1 had a controller board failure (This will be a common cause. I've figured out the problem since this happened.) Data Disk 5 kicked the bucket spectacularly. The Seek Error Rate went from 85% accurate, which is the average in my server due to how many disks are in there. To 1% in the span of 3 days. Making it infuriatingly slow to get any data off the drive but still possible. Data 8 and 11 both experienced controller board failures. Strange drop outs in connection, hang ups, read and write error flags despite no data corruption either reading or writing. Obviously I couldn't trust those drives anymore. But this thing is, only 2 of these failures are genuine faults. The other 3 are my fault. The drives that had controller board failures, at least some of them, were due to how much pressure was being put on the sata connectors when I closed the side panel. Yes, I'm serious. In any other circumstance, the Define R6 would have ample room for sata power and data cables at the rear of the case. But when you have 11 drives and all their cables back there, the thickness of the noise dampening foam presses into those cables and puts dangerous amounts of pressure on the connectors. I proved this by running read checks on the \"failing drives\" with and without the side panel on. With it off, 1 drive had errors 100% of the time. With it on, all drives showed the same errors. Errors which disappeared when I removed the side panel... SMH. So now I need to replace yet more drives, the cables and the case. My server is a bottomless money pit. It has to be."},

I was wondering what would be the best way to test them, as I've read about a bunch of different ones (like smartctl, Badblocks, HD Sentinel, etc.) And it's making my head spin a bit. I guess my questions are as followed: What/how many tests need to be run on a refurb drive? I've seen some posts listing multiple long tests and others just saying a few SMART tests. Is there any general consensus? Badblocks is on Linux only, would that work on something like WSL? Or would I have to get a Linux machine/VM setup? I have a Pi 3 collecting dust, could that be used? How long would testing the drives take? I've seen that a full badblocks 4 pass run can take days or even a week of 24/7 running just for one drive. Does that sound right? I was thinking about using a secondary machine like my old Thinkpad if it was going to take a week. My desktop (where the drive will eventually end up) is in use daily, and I'd be a bit concerned about leaving it on but not killing the test accidentally. I'm a bit new to all this, only having a 2TB and 4TB drive for the past few years. Any help in making sense of all this would be appreciated."},
{"Title": "Ripping entire Russian Encyclopedia - viable?", "Author": "u/gulisav", "Content": "I'm not extremely tech savy, so I have some possibly silly questions. Two days ago it's been announced that Great Russian Encyclopedia has been given no funding this year at all and the encyclopedia will be discontinued. (The encyclopedia is a heir to the Great Soviet Encyclopedia, and is fairly decent as far as general encyclopedias go.) Apparently Russia has bigger priorities than funding an encyclopedia... So, I think I might try my hand at saving the encyclopedia's online edition, before it 404s. Now, there are two domains, bigenc and old.bigenc (both .ru domains), and I'll focus on the latter. It seems fairly simple to rip, because each encyclopedic article has a corresponding PDF file, with the URLs only changing their final number (with 6 or 7 digits). I could produce a list of all the possible URLs in Excel. However, if I were to feed that list to a download manager, I'm wondering if that would cause any serious issues on the part of the server. There's probably close to a hundred thousand articles available on the site, and the downloader would also have to check possibly millions of URLs that contain no PDFs. Would this be like a sort of borderline DDOS attack? Could my requests be blocked? Furthermore, even if I rip all that stuff, it would result in thousands of files with nothing in particular to identify them, as the filenames are just numbers. Is there a way to derive the article titles from the text within the PDFs (which ofc include the title of the article) and rename the files accordingly? (The PDFs themselves are small in size, so I'm not worrying about space constraints.)"},

This works as my Plex server and it's where I dump files from the desktop/laptop, it's running on Windows 10 for now, but about to switch to FreeBSD or TrueNAS (or Proxmox?) with ZFS pool. Now I've added an Asustor AS1102TL Drivestor 2 Lite (2 bays, 1GbE) which is probably being returned for an AS1104T Drivestor 4 (4 bays, 2,5GbE). It is supposed to be a remote NAS using Wireguard, that's why I didn't care for 1GbE, but the initial backup is taking a LONG time. The price difference is only 100€ for more bays and speed (useful for full copies and full restores if needed). Here there's a 6Tb WD \"white label\" and an 8Tb Barracuda as single volumes (JBOD looks risky and can't use RAID with different drives). Part of my issue is which file transfer protocol to use. NFS? My desktop and laptop are Windows, not sure NFS works properly. FTP? Or SMB? SMB is giving me speed issues, not going over 150MBps and for some reason when cloning the 6Tb IronWolf to the 6Tb WD \"white label\" the speed sinks to 10MBps. It's copying RAW photos and videos, like thousands of 50-100Mb files mostly. Having file access sorted, what's your recommendation for file transfer/backup? Asustor Backup Plan? Paragon Backup and Recovery? Macrium Reflect? Or, since I already own SyncBackPro, just use that? This question is related to both, from my computers to the main NAS and main NAS to the Asustor. A little guidance will be much appreciated, since I want to go through this once and \"forget\". My day job is IT PM so I know my way around a computer, but by far not an expert in this area. ty"},

Feel free to lmk if you think there's a better place to post this. I'm trying to archive the different versions of Disney movies that have regional differences. For example, I have the different versions of Inside Out where Riley hates either broccoli (US) or green bell peppers (Japan). Most movies only have a few variations, but Cars 2 and Planes each has about 7 variations each where the design of a car or a plane changes depending on the region. I've gotten nearly all of them, and almost all the variations of all the other movies, except for three: Chinese Zootopia (secondary newscaster is a panda) Russian Cars 2 (Car is styled as the Russian flag) Russian Planes (the \"sexy\" girl plane is styled after the Russian flag) You can probably see why I'm having trouble with these. Disney+ isn't offered in those countries for geopolitical reasons. I've scoured the internet that is available to me looking for ways to source these either physically or digitally, but even my non-public sources are not very interested in this kind of thing.

Hi fellow hoarders. I'm not sure if this is the right place to post this, but I figure this is a good place to ask fellow hoarders about what they hoard. Feel free to lmk if you think there's a better place to post this. I'm trying to archive the different versions of Disney movies that have regional differences. For example, I have the different versions of Inside Out where Riley hates either broccoli (US) or green bell peppers (Japan). Most movies only have a few variations, but Cars 2 and Planes each has about 7 variations each where the design of a car or a plane changes depending on the region. I've gotten nearly all of them, and almost all the variations of all the other movies, except for three: Chinese Zootopia (secondary newscaster is a panda) Russian Cars 2 (Car is styled as the Russian flag) Russian Planes (the \"sexy\" girl plane is styled after the Russian flag) You can probably see why I'm having trouble with these. Disney+ isn't offered in those countries for geopolitical reasons. I've scoured the internet that is available to me looking for ways to source these either physically or digitally, but even my non-public sources are not very interested in this kind of thing. So I'm reduced to looking for physical Blu-ray's of them and that is going about as well as you might expect. So I'm wondering if anyone has ideas of ways I might be able to swing this. Thanks in advance!"},
{"Title": "For photos and videos backup, is it better to use a cloud-based storage service or buy an SSD drive?", "Author": "u/jesuisapprenant", "Content": "I got a subscription for Dropbox at around $12 per month, and I was wondering if it is worth it to just buy a 2TB SSD drive since overall the cost is much cheaper (a nice SSD with 500mb r&w is about $119 so that's 10 months of storage cost for Dropbox, so I break even at 10 months. The pros of Dropbox is that I can access it anywhere, even on my phone, and I don't have to worry about data loss or drive failure or my disk getting stolen or lost. I also won't have to carry that disk around. The pros of an external drive is that it's much cheaper and it pays for itself in 10 months. I can also transfer data in and out much faster. I also don't need internet to access my files. Which solution is better for my use case? TIA"},

Not sure why the drive went degraded except that we had a storm the other night and my UPSs battery apparently failed (less than 6 months old) and the server hard shutdown. The drives were unlikely to be writing anything as I don't currently write to that array. It's purely read operations.

Send or comment links of videos you need downloaded. Currently going through POV livestreams/replays. NOTE: livestreams/POV are of the utmost importance. AKA Twitch/dlive/Facebook Live, etc. If you find any of these POV angles, please tag me directly in your comment, or PM me. These generally get taken down VERY fast by the livestream website. UPDATE: Thank you to everyone who shared links (and continue to do so). I am noticing that a lot of the content is now duplicates, or variations (crops, lower quality, etc) of the same content. So I have put all the content I have on MEGA. If I have replied to your comment then the content for sure is in this torrent. MEGA: https://mega.nz/folder/30MlkQib#RDOaGzmtFEHkxSYBaJSzVA (this is the prefered way of downloading) (This is sitting in at ~350GB as of Jan 10 3:00 PM EST. Still adding content) UPDATE 2: Link should be working - MEGA contacted me and reinstated the account (and gave premium so I could upload more).

My wholehearted thanks for every seeder who takes part in this rescue mission, and every person who raises their voice in support of Sci-Hub's vision for Open Science. Rescue Mission Links Quick start to rescuing Sci-Hub : Download 1 random torrent (100GB) from the scimag index of torrents with fewer than 12 seeders , open the .torrent file using a BitTorrent client, then leave your client open to upload (seed) the articles to others. You're now part of an un-censorable library archive! Initial success update: The entire Sci-Hub collection has at least 3 seeders: Let's get it to 5. Let's get it to 7! Let’s get it to 10! Let’s get it to 12! Contribute to open source Sci-Hub projects: freereadorg/awesome-libgen Join r/scihub to stay up to date Note: We have no affiliation with Sci-Hub This effort is completely unaffiliated from Sci-Hub, no one is in touch with Sci-Hub, and I don't speak for Sci-Hub in any form. Always refer to sci-hub.do for the latest from Sci-Hub directly. This is a data preservation effort for just the articles, and does not help Sci-Hub directly.  Sci-Hub is not in any further imminent danger than it always has been, and is not at greater risk of being shut-down than before. A Rescue Mission for Sci-Hub and Open Science Elsevier and the USDOJ have declared war against Sci-Hub and open science. The era of Sci-Hub and Alexandra standing alone in this fight must end. We have to take a stand with her. On May 7th, Sci-Hub's Alexandra Elbakyan revealed that the FBI has been wiretapping her accounts for over 2 years. This news comes after Twitter silenced the official Sci_Hub twitter account because Indian academics were organizing on it against Elsevier. Sci-Hub itself is currently frozen and has not downloaded any new articles since December 2020. This rescue mission is focused on seeding the article collection in order to prepare for a potential Sci-Hub shutdown. Alexandra Elbakyan of Sci-Hub, bookwarrior of Library Genesis , Aaron Swartz , and countless unnamed others have fought to free science from the grips of for-profit publishers. Today, they do it working in hiding, alone, without acknowledgment, in fear of imprisonment, and even now wiretapped by the FBI. They sacrifice everything for one vision: Open Science. Why do they do it? They do it so that humble scholars on the other side of the planet can practice medicine, create science, fight for democracy, teach, and learn. People like Alexandra Elbakyan would give up their personal freedom for that one goal: to free knowledge. For that, Elsevier Corp (RELX, market cap: 50 billion) wants to silence her, wants to see her in prison, and wants to shut Sci-Hub down. It's time we sent Elsevier and the USDOJ a clearer message about the fate of Sci-Hub and open science: we are the library, we do not get silenced, we do not shut down our computers, and we are many. Rescue Mission for Sci-Hub If you have been following the story, then you know that this is not our first rescue mission. We protected the Library Genesis book collection We unlocked over 5,000 COVID-19 research articles We successfully petitioned publishers to unlock their COVID-19 paywalls bookwarrior, the founder of Library Genesis, took his library onto the de-centralized and un-censorable IPFS web Next? Make Sci-Hub un-censorable too. Rescue Target A handful of Library Genesis seeders are currently seeding the Sci-Hub torrents. There are 850 scihub torrents , each containing 100,000 scientific articles, to a total of 85 million scientific articles: 77TB. This is the complete Sci-Hub database. We need to protect this. Rescue Team Wave 1: We need 85 datahoarders to store and seed 1TB of articles each, 10 torrents in total. Download 10 random torrents from the scimag index of < 12 seeders , then load the torrents onto your client and seed for as long as you can. The articles are coded by DOI and in zip files. Wave 2: Reach out to 10 good friends to ask them to grab just 1 random torrent (100GB). That's 850 seeders. We are now the library. Final Wave: Development for an open source Sci-Hub. freereadorg/awesome-libgen is a collection of open source achievements based on the Sci-Hub and Library Genesis databases. Open source de-centralization of Sci-Hub is the ultimate goal here, and this begins with the data, but it is going to take years of developer sweat to carry these libraries into the future. Heartfelt thanks to the r/datahoarder and r/seedboxes communities, seedbox.io and NFOrce for your support for previous missions and your love for science."},

These changes are what killed pushshift.io (full reddit archives and searchable api used by mods and many research/academic papers) and what will kill most (if not all) third-party reddit clients. This is obviously a detriment to everyone, and while Reddit will almost certainly go through with these changes regardless, thousands of subreddits are going to be participating in a 2-day (or longer) blackout. You can read more about the blackouts at r/ModCoord . At the very least, the planned blackout seems to have convinced Reddit to give free API access to accessibility clients. Hopefully it can change their minds further. r/DataHoarder will be locked for an undetermined amount of time, see this thread for reddit data archives, tools, etc. we will also be using this time to update our sidebar links and do some general maintenance in the hopes that this mess doesn't mean the end for us and the many communities that see this as a killing of the Reddit we have loved over the years.

{"Title": "The Coronavirus Papers unlocked: 5,352 scientific articles covering the coronavirus - fully searchable and free.", "Author": "u/shrine", "Content": "2020-04-15 update: the-eye.eu is temporarily down, but the de-centralized Interplanetary File System (IPFS) link remains up. Note, publishers have made most Coronavirus articles free as of March 6th 2020. Visit r/libgen and r/scihub to join the open science revolution. Access Article listing / Links Open Directory Full-text Search Torrent InterPlanetary File System Information In a 2015 New York Times op-ed the chief medical officer of Liberia argued that the Ebola pandemic responsible for the loss of over 2,200 lives could have been prevented if not for a paywall blocking access to an article from 1982. Dividing the world’s scientists with a paywall in the middle of a global humanitarian crisis is an unacceptable and unforgivable act of criminal greed. In the developing world the price for a single article can amount to as much as half a week’s salary for a physician. A few days ago, I found an early-release coronavirus article with a $35.95 access fee for non-subscribers. The fury I felt brought tears to my eyes. Me and a few friends share that fury, so we gathered a collection of five-thousand scientific studies covering any article title containing “ coronav* ” from 1968-2020. The scope of the papers spans not only the 7 human coronaviruses, but up to 40 other Coronaviridae family strains. The Ebola virus showed us that every study counts. We are on the first step towards compiling a complete open-access Coronaviridae research catalog for the world’s scientists, journalists, and virology experts to draw from to fight the virus and save lives. Our project is illegal, but it’s the right thing to do in this crisis. We refuse to put copyright before human lives. Sharing everything we know about the virus is essential, which is why international scientists are openly sharing their coronavirus findings in an unprecedented way . Developing-world scientists often work without article access due to complex and expensive contract agreements between publishers, universities, and hospitals, relying on overseas colleagues to help them hunt down PDF files. The virus is not going to wait for this, so we need to act with conviction, now. To their credit, publishers made a few dozen papers open-access in the last few days, which you can find over at Elsevier’s Novel Coronavirus Information Center and Wiley’s Coronavirus collection. While Wiley is slating to shut down their collection in April, our collection won’t be shutting down anytime soon. We’re going to keep growing to help our scientists out, and you can help us complete the catalog by identifying any papers we missed. All extant Coronaviridae research, accessible in seconds, by any scientist in the world. It’s the least we can do to help. Methodology How did we do it? We scanned Sci-Hub 's 80 million title collection for the coronavirus, then we extracted the titles and Digital Object Identifiers (DOI) to an index, and exported the PDF files to upload them to The-Eye.eu’s full-text search repository. How can I help? We always need developers. You can also help us identify new articles by joining our team spreadsheet here . Request access and you can begin adding new article titles to the list. You can also help share word of the collection with the scientific community by reaching out to journalists. Who is helping us? Our brave host is The-Eye.eu , a “non-profit, community driven platform dedicated to the archiving and long-term preservation of any and all data,” making this project just one of the many public access preservation projects they stand behind. You can aid projects like this one by donating toward their server bills. A thank you to Sci-Hub and Library Genesis. Last year communities across reddit (including r/seedboxes and r/DataHoarder ) came together in a mission to secure and preserve Sci-Hub and Library Genesis, collectively the two largest free and open non-profit library collections in the world: Sci-Hub’s 80-million scientific article database that made this project possible, and LibGen’s 2.5-million scientific-book collection. The libraries fulfill United Nations world development goals mandating the removal of restrictions on access to science, and they serve developing world doctors, academic researchers, and other experts in society with the knowledge they need to build a better world. Keeping these libraries open and thriving means saving lives, educating the world, and providing invaluable science to humanity’s global experts. Thank you to everyone involved in the project, The-Eye.eu for their support, and to all the scientists around the world working on behalf of humanity today."},

We’re iFixit, and we just launched the world’s most comprehensive medical equipment repair database", "Author": "u/Craig_iFixit", "Content": "After my recent comment on here blew up, I figured you all would get a kick out of this. TL;DR: We scraped the internet for any and all medical equipment repair documentation we could find. We ended up with over 13,000 PDFs across 5,000 medical devices, all uploaded to iFixit.com and available for free to anyone and everyone. ----- Hospitals are having trouble getting service information to fix medical equipment and manufacturers can’t keep pace with the growing demand for repair of critical hospital equipment. On top of that, biomedical technicians spend countless hours scouring the internet searching for crucial repair information. This is not a great way to run a health system. So we’ve been fixing that. Over the last two months, we’ve pivoted half our company to build the world’s most comprehensive medical equipment service database . We just posted more than 13,000 PDFs from hundreds of manufacturers—online and available for free. You can find them in our Medical Device category. This has been an absolutely massive undertaking, and we were fortunate to have the help and support of over 200 librarians and archivists from across the country. Archivists from university and public libraries, research institutes, insurance and software companies, and of course biomedical technicians themselves, all donated their valuable time. Collectively, they’ve contributed thousands of hours organizing piles of documents into a navigable, searchable system. Some medical manufacturers, like Mindray , allow biomeds to access their manuals freely. A few more released select documents after the outbreak of COVID-19. But for their day-to-day work, biomeds have long relied on a rag-tag set of web resources to get the job done. Among the most popular is Frank’s Hospital Workshop , a Tanzania-based site that hosts hundreds of medical device manuals—it’s the unofficial biomed bible. But we wanted to make it easier for anyone to find the right manual, especially in an emergency. Some of the documents in our collection were already available. Others were not publicly posted until now . And it was important to us that this resource didn’t just duplicate existing resources, but improved accessibility in a meaningful way. To be very clear: iFixit will not make any money off of this project . We are providing hosting and curation free of charge, and free of advertising, to the medical community. We welcome manufacturers to join us and contribute toward an up-to-date central repository for the biomedical community, as well as biomedical technicians around the world to join iFixit’s repair community . No technician is an island, and we hope to facilitate an exchange of knowledge and troubleshooting. This medical repository is most useful if it’s collaboratively moderated by biomedical technicians, with our assistance."},

My order is this: Minimum: Short Long self-test (which will do an initial READ) Surface WRITE+Read with default 0's Quick format (to NTFS for use) Extensive: Short self-test Quick format (to NTFS, solely for the next step) Filling disk with large files ( using TeraCopy verify+test using H2TestW) Surface READ test Surface WRITE+Read with default 0's Surface WRITE+Read with 1's ( 0xFF) Surface WRITE+Read back with 0's Quick format (to NTFS) Alternatively, badblocks instead of steps 5-7, or full u/ EchoGecko795 routine below in the comments. Thanks to everyone, all questions answered! Some notes: Extended self-test can be skipped, as it just short self-test + READ test sequence within the drive, just less informative than the Surface read test as doesn't consider connectivity performance Full format in Windows isn't needed, as it's the same as Surface READ + WRITE (with 0's) tests, maybe more limited, and quick format is enough just to change the filesystem Different surface write+read patterns emulate the 4-pass badblocks test A few things I wanted to clarify: how redundant is filling the drive with files, considering further WRITE+Read surface test? Does it only serve as another WRITE pass, just with different data? do I really need the Read test before the WRITE+Read test , or is the latter enough? (i.e. can a READ before WRITE indicate something that a READ after WRITE won't?). My idea was to see the initial READ after the drive is filled with files, then overwriting it with 0's and reading again how important is changing the pattern/flipping 0's to 1's? should I flip 1's to 0's back again? Can the 1's pattern remain, following a quick format prior to using the drive? And finally, is the more time-consuming 3-4 pass procedure really worth it, and not an overkill?"},

Thanks for any advice. https://preview.redd.it/shucking-an-old-wd-my-book-v0-hyto1szn9l6d1.jpg https://preview.redd.it/shucking-an-old-wd-my-book-v0-sr1olvho9l6d1.jpg"},
{"Title": "How do you go about pruning your hoard?", "Author": "u/Clive1792", "Content": "Personally I feel snowed under with what I've got. There's countless files on my PC scattered everywhere. Documents, pictures (probably in the 100,000s), audio files, video files. It's most certainly not organised at all, it's scattered all over the hard drives on this PC in various folders & folders of folders. But to make it better I had no real backup plan. I'd just drag & drop and then not really remember what I'd backed up and what I hadn't so then I'd buy a new hard drive & make another copy because the last drive was fairly full. I now have a number of drives that surely have many multiples of various single files. My end goal is I would like some organisation rather than random files & folders scattered here there & everywhere. I'd like to get rid of the multiple duplicate files & also delete files I no longer want/need. Have any of you attacked this kind of task? Any tips or do you really just do it file-by-file? Which to be honest with what I've got & the fact I only have limited time outside of work, this is going to take me many months if not 12months plus .... and that's if I get stuck in & stay focused doing it day in day out."},

Send or comment links of videos you need downloaded. Currently going through POV livestreams/replays. NOTE: livestreams/POV are of the utmost importance. AKA Twitch/dlive/Facebook Live, etc. If you find any of these POV angles, please tag me directly in your comment, or PM me. These generally get taken down VERY fast by the livestream website. UPDATE: Thank you to everyone who shared links (and continue to do so). I am noticing that a lot of the content is now duplicates, or variations (crops, lower quality, etc) of the same content. So I have put all the content I have on MEGA. If I have replied to your comment then the content for sure is in this torrent. MEGA: https://mega.nz/folder/30MlkQib#RDOaGzmtFEHkxSYBaJSzVA (this is the prefered way of downloading) (This is sitting in at ~350GB as of Jan 10 3:00 PM EST. Still adding content) UPDATE 2: Link should be working - MEGA contacted me and reinstated the account (and gave premium so I could upload more).

When I looked at Amazon I saw that there are many options of new models if standard spinning drives for much less. As far as I know from reading over the years spinning drives are more likely to fail than the spinning disk drives.  But I haven’t ever actually seen the test data to see just how likely or unlikely they are to break compared to SSD. If this drive is going to be used only at home and not carried anywhere, does anyone have any idea just how much more likely it is to fail than an SSD? Bonus: question, are WesternDigital SSDs any better or worse than Samsung? Or are there any established brands are are absolutely better to avoid?"},
{"Title": "Rescue Mission for Sci-Hub and Open Science: We are the library.", "Author": "u/shrine", "Content": "EFF hears the call: \"It’s Time to Fight for Open Access\" EFF reports: Activists Mobilize to Fight Censorship and Save Open Science \"Continuing the long tradition of internet hacktivism ... redditors are mobilizing to create an uncensorable back-up of Sci-Hub\" The EFF stands with Sci-Hub in the fight for Open Science, a fight for the human right to benefit and share in human scientific advancement. My wholehearted thanks for every seeder who takes part in this rescue mission, and every person who raises their voice in support of Sci-Hub's vision for Open Science. Rescue Mission Links Quick start to rescuing Sci-Hub : Download 1 random torrent (100GB) from the scimag index of torrents with fewer than 12 seeders , open the .torrent file using a BitTorrent client, then leave your client open to upload (seed) the articles to others. You're now part of an un-censorable library archive! Initial success update: The entire Sci-Hub collection has at least 3 seeders: Let's get it to 5. Let's get it to 7! Let’s get it to 10! Let’s get it to 12! Contribute to open source Sci-Hub projects: freereadorg/awesome-libgen Join r/scihub to stay up to date Note: We have no affiliation with Sci-Hub This effort is completely unaffiliated from Sci-Hub, no one is in touch with Sci-Hub, and I don't speak for Sci-Hub in any form. Always refer to sci-hub.do for the latest from Sci-Hub directly. This is a data preservation effort for just the articles, and does not help Sci-Hub directly.  Sci-Hub is not in any further imminent danger than it always has been, and is not at greater risk of being shut-down than before. A Rescue Mission for Sci-Hub and Open Science Elsevier and the USDOJ have declared war against Sci-Hub and open science. The era of Sci-Hub and Alexandra standing alone in this fight must end. We have to take a stand with her. On May 7th, Sci-Hub's Alexandra Elbakyan revealed that the FBI has been wiretapping her accounts for over 2 years. This news comes after Twitter silenced the official Sci_Hub twitter account because Indian academics were organizing on it against Elsevier. Sci-Hub itself is currently frozen and has not downloaded any new articles since December 2020. This rescue mission is focused on seeding the article collection in order to prepare for a potential Sci-Hub shutdown. Alexandra Elbakyan of Sci-Hub, bookwarrior of Library Genesis , Aaron Swartz , and countless unnamed others have fought to free science from the grips of for-profit publishers. Today, they do it working in hiding, alone, without acknowledgment, in fear of imprisonment, and even now wiretapped by the FBI. They sacrifice everything for one vision: Open Science. Why do they do it? They do it so that humble scholars on the other side of the planet can practice medicine, create science, fight for democracy, teach, and learn. People like Alexandra Elbakyan would give up their personal freedom for that one goal: to free knowledge. For that, Elsevier Corp (RELX, market cap: 50 billion) wants to silence her, wants to see her in prison, and wants to shut Sci-Hub down. It's time we sent Elsevier and the USDOJ a clearer message about the fate of Sci-Hub and open science: we are the library, we do not get silenced, we do not shut down our computers, and we are many. Rescue Mission for Sci-Hub If you have been following the story, then you know that this is not our first rescue mission. We protected the Library Genesis book collection We unlocked over 5,000 COVID-19 research articles We successfully petitioned publishers to unlock their COVID-19 paywalls bookwarrior, the founder of Library Genesis, took his library onto the de-centralized and un-censorable IPFS web Next? Make Sci-Hub un-censorable too. Rescue Target A handful of Library Genesis seeders are currently seeding the Sci-Hub torrents. There are 850 scihub torrents , each containing 100,000 scientific articles, to a total of 85 million scientific articles: 77TB. This is the complete Sci-Hub database. We need to protect this. Rescue Team Wave 1: We need 85 datahoarders to store and seed 1TB of articles each, 10 torrents in total. Download 10 random torrents from the scimag index of < 12 seeders , then load the torrents onto your client and seed for as long as you can. The articles are coded by DOI and in zip files. Wave 2: Reach out to 10 good friends to ask them to grab just 1 random torrent (100GB). That's 850 seeders. We are now the library. Final Wave: Development for an open source Sci-Hub. freereadorg/awesome-libgen is a collection of open source achievements based on the Sci-Hub and Library Genesis databases. Open source de-centralization of Sci-Hub is the ultimate goal here, and this begins with the data, but it is going to take years of developer sweat to carry these libraries into the future. Heartfelt thanks to the r/datahoarder and r/seedboxes communities, seedbox.io and NFOrce for your support for previous missions and your love for science."},

Send or comment links of videos you need downloaded. Currently going through POV livestreams/replays. NOTE: livestreams/POV are of the utmost importance. AKA Twitch/dlive/Facebook Live, etc. If you find any of these POV angles, please tag me directly in your comment, or PM me. These generally get taken down VERY fast by the livestream website. UPDATE: Thank you to everyone who shared links (and continue to do so). I am noticing that a lot of the content is now duplicates, or variations (crops, lower quality, etc) of the same content. So I have put all the content I have on MEGA. If I have replied to your comment then the content for sure is in this torrent. MEGA: https://mega.nz/folder/30MlkQib#RDOaGzmtFEHkxSYBaJSzVA (this is the prefered way of downloading) (This is sitting in at ~350GB as of Jan 10 3:00 PM EST. Still adding content) UPDATE 2: Link should be working - MEGA contacted me and reinstated the account (and gave premium so I could upload more).

My wholehearted thanks for every seeder who takes part in this rescue mission, and every person who raises their voice in support of Sci-Hub's vision for Open Science. Rescue Mission Links Quick start to rescuing Sci-Hub : Download 1 random torrent (100GB) from the scimag index of torrents with fewer than 12 seeders , open the .torrent file using a BitTorrent client, then leave your client open to upload (seed) the articles to others. You're now part of an un-censorable library archive! Initial success update: The entire Sci-Hub collection has at least 3 seeders: Let's get it to 5. Let's get it to 7! Let’s get it to 10! Let’s get it to 12! Contribute to open source Sci-Hub projects: freereadorg/awesome-libgen Join r/scihub to stay up to date Note: We have no affiliation with Sci-Hub This effort is completely unaffiliated from Sci-Hub, no one is in touch with Sci-Hub, and I don't speak for Sci-Hub in any form. Always refer to sci-hub.do for the latest from Sci-Hub directly. This is a data preservation effort for just the articles, and does not help Sci-Hub directly.  Sci-Hub is not in any further imminent danger than it always has been, and is not at greater risk of being shut-down than before. A Rescue Mission for Sci-Hub and Open Science Elsevier and the USDOJ have declared war against Sci-Hub and open science. The era of Sci-Hub and Alexandra standing alone in this fight must end. We have to take a stand with her. On May 7th, Sci-Hub's Alexandra Elbakyan revealed that the FBI has been wiretapping her accounts for over 2 years. This news comes after Twitter silenced the official Sci_Hub twitter account because Indian academics were organizing on it against Elsevier. Sci-Hub itself is currently frozen and has not downloaded any new articles since December 2020. This rescue mission is focused on seeding the article collection in order to prepare for a potential Sci-Hub shutdown. Alexandra Elbakyan of Sci-Hub, bookwarrior of Library Genesis , Aaron Swartz , and countless unnamed others have fought to free science from the grips of for-profit publishers. Today, they do it working in hiding, alone, without acknowledgment, in fear of imprisonment, and even now wiretapped by the FBI. They sacrifice everything for one vision: Open Science. Why do they do it? They do it so that humble scholars on the other side of the planet can practice medicine, create science, fight for democracy, teach, and learn. People like Alexandra Elbakyan would give up their personal freedom for that one goal: to free knowledge. For that, Elsevier Corp (RELX, market cap: 50 billion) wants to silence her, wants to see her in prison, and wants to shut Sci-Hub down. It's time we sent Elsevier and the USDOJ a clearer message about the fate of Sci-Hub and open science: we are the library, we do not get silenced, we do not shut down our computers, and we are many. Rescue Mission for Sci-Hub If you have been following the story, then you know that this is not our first rescue mission. We protected the Library Genesis book collection We unlocked over 5,000 COVID-19 research articles We successfully petitioned publishers to unlock their COVID-19 paywalls bookwarrior, the founder of Library Genesis, took his library onto the de-centralized and un-censorable IPFS web Next? Make Sci-Hub un-censorable too. Rescue Target A handful of Library Genesis seeders are currently seeding the Sci-Hub torrents. There are 850 scihub torrents , each containing 100,000 scientific articles, to a total of 85 million scientific articles: 77TB. This is the complete Sci-Hub database. We need to protect this. Rescue Team Wave 1: We need 85 datahoarders to store and seed 1TB of articles each, 10 torrents in total. Download 10 random torrents from the scimag index of < 12 seeders , then load the torrents onto your client and seed for as long as you can. The articles are coded by DOI and in zip files. Wave 2: Reach out to 10 good friends to ask them to grab just 1 random torrent (100GB). That's 850 seeders. We are now the library. Final Wave: Development for an open source Sci-Hub. freereadorg/awesome-libgen is a collection of open source achievements based on the Sci-Hub and Library Genesis databases. Open source de-centralization of Sci-Hub is the ultimate goal here, and this begins with the data, but it is going to take years of developer sweat to carry these libraries into the future. Heartfelt thanks to the r/datahoarder and r/seedboxes communities, seedbox.io and NFOrce for your support for previous missions and your love for science."},

The serial numbers do trace back to Seagate, but I'm experiencing some unusual issues with it. Has anyone else encountered this? Here's what's happening when I test it with my Windows machine: With the machine powered off, I plug in the drive, but the machine doesn't boot. With the machine powered off, I boot to BIOS, and the disk is found. However, after rebooting, the machine doesn't boot. If I unplug the drive after step 2, the machine boots normally. If I plug the drive back in at the login screen, the machine freezes. If I log in first and then plug the drive in, I can see the task manager showing max activity on my main OS SSD before the machine freezes. Unplugging the drive at this point unfreezes the machine. I've bought a number of drives this way before and never had a serious issue. Any insights or suggestions would be greatly appreciated. In the meantime I am reaching out to the seller. The other drive I got seems to work fine."},

After discussion in another thread, I've decided to not go with Windows OS on the server and instead run a Linux based OS so some sort. My hardware is a i5-9500 with 8gb or ram. In terms of storage I have a 256gb m2 NVME, 2x 10tb HDD and a 256g 2.5\" SSD if it is useful in some way. This leaves me with 2 sata3 ports(1 if I use the 2.5\" SSD) and 1 m2 slot available for further expansion of storage. Initial intended uses are to run JellyFin media server, Home Assistant and an image management app for pics, all local. I would like full redundancy via raid1, this is where I'm a bit uncertain on approach. I assume I'll run the OS and any apps on the NVME, not the HDD. Since i have the additional NVME slot available is there benefit to adding a second NVME drive for cache or even a mirror of the OS and apps? Should I be looking to manage my raid with an application of some sort or in the Debian OS itself? If the raid is setup in Debian, how does that affect future expansion? Do i have to add pairs of drives or could I for example just add a 18tb random drive? If for example a year from now I add 2 additional drives, at that time would there be a better solution than raid1? Thanks for your time."},

The drive is originally in exFAT with some warranty content on it. I have Windows 10, so not using badblocks, but have HD Sentinel. My order is this: Minimum: Short Long self-test (which will do an initial READ) Surface WRITE+Read with default 0's Quick format (to NTFS for use) Extensive: Short self-test Quick format (to NTFS, solely for the next step) Filling disk with large files ( using TeraCopy verify+test using H2TestW) Surface READ test Surface WRITE+Read with default 0's Surface WRITE+Read with 1's ( 0xFF) Surface WRITE+Read back with 0's Quick format (to NTFS) Alternatively, badblocks instead of steps 5-7, or full u/ EchoGecko795 routine below in the comments. Thanks to everyone, all questions answered! Some notes: Extended self-test can be skipped, as it just short self-test + READ test sequence within the drive, just less informative than the Surface read test as doesn't consider connectivity performance Full format in Windows isn't needed, as it's the same as Surface READ + WRITE (with 0's) tests, maybe more limited, and quick format is enough just to change the filesystem Different surface write+read patterns emulate the 4-pass badblocks test A few things I wanted to clarify: how redundant is filling the drive with files, considering further WRITE+Read surface test? Does it only serve as another WRITE pass, just with different data? do I really need the Read test before the WRITE+Read test , or is the latter enough? (i.e. can a READ before WRITE indicate something that a READ after WRITE won't?). My idea was to see the initial READ after the drive is filled with files, then overwriting it with 0's and reading again how important is changing the pattern/flipping 0's to 1's? should I flip 1's to 0's back again? Can the 1's pattern remain, following a quick format prior to using the drive? And finally, is the more time-consuming 3-4 pass procedure really worth it, and not an overkill?"},

Note, publishers have made most Coronavirus articles free as of March 6th 2020. Visit r/libgen and r/scihub to join the open science revolution. Access Article listing / Links Open Directory Full-text Search Torrent InterPlanetary File System Information In a 2015 New York Times op-ed the chief medical officer of Liberia argued that the Ebola pandemic responsible for the loss of over 2,200 lives could have been prevented if not for a paywall blocking access to an article from 1982. Dividing the world’s scientists with a paywall in the middle of a global humanitarian crisis is an unacceptable and unforgivable act of criminal greed. In the developing world the price for a single article can amount to as much as half a week’s salary for a physician. A few days ago, I found an early-release coronavirus article with a $35.95 access fee for non-subscribers. The fury I felt brought tears to my eyes. Me and a few friends share that fury, so we gathered a collection of five-thousand scientific studies covering any article title containing “ coronav* ” from 1968-2020. The scope of the papers spans not only the 7 human coronaviruses, but up to 40 other Coronaviridae family strains. The Ebola virus showed us that every study counts. We are on the first step towards compiling a complete open-access Coronaviridae research catalog for the world’s scientists, journalists, and virology experts to draw from to fight the virus and save lives. Our project is illegal, but it’s the right thing to do in this crisis. We refuse to put copyright before human lives. Sharing everything we know about the virus is essential, which is why international scientists are openly sharing their coronavirus findings in an unprecedented way . Developing-world scientists often work without article access due to complex and expensive contract agreements between publishers, universities, and hospitals, relying on overseas colleagues to help them hunt down PDF files. The virus is not going to wait for this, so we need to act with conviction, now. To their credit, publishers made a few dozen papers open-access in the last few days, which you can find over at Elsevier’s Novel Coronavirus Information Center and Wiley’s Coronavirus collection. While Wiley is slating to shut down their collection in April, our collection won’t be shutting down anytime soon. We’re going to keep growing to help our scientists out, and you can help us complete the catalog by identifying any papers we missed. All extant Coronaviridae research, accessible in seconds, by any scientist in the world. It’s the least we can do to help. Methodology How did we do it? We scanned Sci-Hub 's 80 million title collection for the coronavirus, then we extracted the titles and Digital Object Identifiers (DOI) to an index, and exported the PDF files to upload them to The-Eye.eu’s full-text search repository. How can I help? We always need developers. You can also help us identify new articles by joining our team spreadsheet here . Request access and you can begin adding new article titles to the list. You can also help share word of the collection with the scientific community by reaching out to journalists. Who is helping us? Our brave host is The-Eye.eu , a “non-profit, community driven platform dedicated to the archiving and long-term preservation of any and all data,” making this project just one of the many public access preservation projects they stand behind. You can aid projects like this one by donating toward their server bills. A thank you to Sci-Hub and Library Genesis. Last year communities across reddit (including r/seedboxes and r/DataHoarder ) came together in a mission to secure and preserve Sci-Hub and Library Genesis, collectively the two largest free and open non-profit library collections in the world: Sci-Hub’s 80-million scientific article database that made this project possible, and LibGen’s 2.5-million scientific-book collection. The libraries fulfill United Nations world development goals mandating the removal of restrictions on access to science, and they serve developing world doctors, academic researchers, and other experts in society with the knowledge they need to build a better world. Keeping these libraries open and thriving means saving lives, educating the world, and providing invaluable science to humanity’s global experts. Thank you to everyone involved in the project, The-Eye.eu for their support, and to all the scientists around the world working on behalf of humanity today."},

As you've almost certainly heard by now Reddit is locking down their API starting July 1st with the introduction of paid usage. These changes are what killed pushshift.io (full reddit archives and searchable api used by mods and many research/academic papers) and what will kill most (if not all) third-party reddit clients. This is obviously a detriment to everyone, and while Reddit will almost certainly go through with these changes regardless, thousands of subreddits are going to be participating in a 2-day (or longer) blackout. You can read more about the blackouts at r/ModCoord . At the very least, the planned blackout seems to have convinced Reddit to give free API access to accessibility clients. Hopefully it can change their minds further. r/DataHoarder will be locked for an undetermined amount of time, see this thread for reddit data archives, tools, etc. we will also be using this time to update our sidebar links and do some general maintenance in the hopes that this mess doesn't mean the end for us and the many communities that see this as a killing of the Reddit we have loved over the years. Note; during this time no new posts can be made and all comments are black-holed. ~ The Mod Team, ciao for now. Track the blackout here: https://reddark.untone.uk"},

Note, publishers have made most Coronavirus articles free as of March 6th 2020. Visit r/libgen and r/scihub to join the open science revolution. Access Article listing / Links Open Directory Full-text Search Torrent InterPlanetary File System Information In a 2015 New York Times op-ed the chief medical officer of Liberia argued that the Ebola pandemic responsible for the loss of over 2,200 lives could have been prevented if not for a paywall blocking access to an article from 1982. Dividing the world’s scientists with a paywall in the middle of a global humanitarian crisis is an unacceptable and unforgivable act of criminal greed. In the developing world the price for a single article can amount to as much as half a week’s salary for a physician. A few days ago, I found an early-release coronavirus article with a $35.95 access fee for non-subscribers. The fury I felt brought tears to my eyes. Me and a few friends share that fury, so we gathered a collection of five-thousand scientific studies covering any article title containing “ coronav* ” from 1968-2020. The scope of the papers spans not only the 7 human coronaviruses, but up to 40 other Coronaviridae family strains. The Ebola virus showed us that every study counts. We are on the first step towards compiling a complete open-access Coronaviridae research catalog for the world’s scientists, journalists, and virology experts to draw from to fight the virus and save lives. Our project is illegal, but it’s the right thing to do in this crisis. We refuse to put copyright before human lives. Sharing everything we know about the virus is essential, which is why international scientists are openly sharing their coronavirus findings in an unprecedented way . Developing-world scientists often work without article access due to complex and expensive contract agreements between publishers, universities, and hospitals, relying on overseas colleagues to help them hunt down PDF files. The virus is not going to wait for this, so we need to act with conviction, now. To their credit, publishers made a few dozen papers open-access in the last few days, which you can find over at Elsevier’s Novel Coronavirus Information Center and Wiley’s Coronavirus collection. While Wiley is slating to shut down their collection in April, our collection won’t be shutting down anytime soon.

We’re iFixit, and we just launched the world’s most comprehensive medical equipment repair database", "Author": "u/Craig_iFixit", "Content": "After my recent comment on here blew up, I figured you all would get a kick out of this. TL;DR: We scraped the internet for any and all medical equipment repair documentation we could find. We ended up with over 13,000 PDFs across 5,000 medical devices, all uploaded to iFixit.com and available for free to anyone and everyone. ----- Hospitals are having trouble getting service information to fix medical equipment and manufacturers can’t keep pace with the growing demand for repair of critical hospital equipment. On top of that, biomedical technicians spend countless hours scouring the internet searching for crucial repair information. This is not a great way to run a health system. So we’ve been fixing that. Over the last two months, we’ve pivoted half our company to build the world’s most comprehensive medical equipment service database . We just posted more than 13,000 PDFs from hundreds of manufacturers—online and available for free. You can find them in our Medical Device category. This has been an absolutely massive undertaking, and we were fortunate to have the help and support of over 200 librarians and archivists from across the country. Archivists from university and public libraries, research institutes, insurance and software companies, and of course biomedical technicians themselves, all donated their valuable time. Collectively, they’ve contributed thousands of hours organizing piles of documents into a navigable, searchable system. Some medical manufacturers, like Mindray , allow biomeds to access their manuals freely. A few more released select documents after the outbreak of COVID-19. But for their day-to-day work, biomeds have long relied on a rag-tag set of web resources to get the job done. Among the most popular is Frank’s Hospital Workshop , a Tanzania-based site that hosts hundreds of medical device manuals—it’s the unofficial biomed bible. But we wanted to make it easier for anyone to find the right manual, especially in an emergency. Some of the documents in our collection were already available. Others were not publicly posted until now . And it was important to us that this resource didn’t just duplicate existing resources, but improved accessibility in a meaningful way. To be very clear: iFixit will not make any money off of this project . We are providing hosting and curation free of charge, and free of advertising, to the medical community. We welcome manufacturers to join us and contribute toward an up-to-date central repository for the biomedical community, as well as biomedical technicians around the world to join iFixit’s repair community . No technician is an island, and we hope to facilitate an exchange of knowledge and troubleshooting. This medical repository is most useful if it’s collaboratively moderated by biomedical technicians, with our assistance."},

{"Title": "Hello, r/DataHoarder! We’re iFixit, and we just launched the world’s most comprehensive medical equipment repair database", "Author": "u/Craig_iFixit", "Content": "After my recent comment on here blew up, I figured you all would get a kick out of this. TL;DR: We scraped the internet for any and all medical equipment repair documentation we could find. We ended up with over 13,000 PDFs across 5,000 medical devices, all uploaded to iFixit.com and available for free to anyone and everyone. ----- Hospitals are having trouble getting service information to fix medical equipment and manufacturers can’t keep pace with the growing demand for repair of critical hospital equipment. On top of that, biomedical technicians spend countless hours scouring the internet searching for crucial repair information. This is not a great way to run a health system. So we’ve been fixing that. Over the last two months, we’ve pivoted half our company to build the world’s most comprehensive medical equipment service database . We just posted more than 13,000 PDFs from hundreds of manufacturers—online and available for free. You can find them in our Medical Device category. This has been an absolutely massive undertaking, and we were fortunate to have the help and support of over 200 librarians and archivists from across the country. Archivists from university and public libraries, research institutes, insurance and software companies, and of course biomedical technicians themselves, all donated their valuable time. Collectively, they’ve contributed thousands of hours organizing piles of documents into a navigable, searchable system. Some medical manufacturers, like Mindray , allow biomeds to access their manuals freely. A few more released select documents after the outbreak of COVID-19. But for their day-to-day work, biomeds have long relied on a rag-tag set of web resources to get the job done. Among the most popular is Frank’s Hospital Workshop , a Tanzania-based site that hosts hundreds of medical device manuals—it’s the unofficial biomed bible. But we wanted to make it easier for anyone to find the right manual, especially in an emergency. Some of the documents in our collection were already available. Others were not publicly posted until now . And it was important to us that this resource didn’t just duplicate existing resources, but improved accessibility in a meaningful way. To be very clear: iFixit will not make any money off of this project . We are providing hosting and curation free of charge, and free of advertising, to the medical community. We welcome manufacturers to join us and contribute toward an up-to-date central repository for the biomedical community, as well as biomedical technicians around the world to join iFixit’s repair community . No technician is an island, and we hope to facilitate an exchange of knowledge and troubleshooting. This medical repository is most useful if it’s collaboratively moderated by biomedical technicians, with our assistance."},

We need YOUR help running ArchiveTeam Warrior to archive subreddits before they're gone indefinitely after June 12th!", "Author": "u/BananaBus43", "Content": "ArchiveTeam has been archiving Reddit posts for a while now, but we are running out of time. So far, we have archived 10.81 billion links, with 150 million to go . Recent news of the Reddit API cost changes will force many of the top 3rd party Reddit apps to shut down. This will not only affect how people use Reddit, but it will also cause issues with many subreddit moderation bots which rely on the API to function. Many subreddits have agreed to shut down for 48 hours on June 12th, while others will be gone indefinitely unless this issue is resolved. We are archiving Reddit posts so that in the event that the API cost change is never addressed, we can still access posts from those closed subreddits. Here is how you can help: Choose the \"host\" that matches your current PC, probably Windows or macOS Download ArchiveTeam Warrior In VirtualBox, click File > Import Appliance and open the file. Start the virtual machine. It will fetch the latest updates and will eventually tell you to start your web browser. Once you’ve started your warrior: Go to http://localhost:8001/ and check the Settings page. Choose a username — we’ll show your progress on the leaderboard. Go to the \"All projects\" tab and select ArchiveTeam’s Choice to let your warrior work on the most urgent project. (This will be Reddit). Alternative Method: Docker Download Docker on your \"host\" (Windows, macOS, Linux) Follow the instructions on the ArchiveTeam website to set up Docker When setting up the project container, it will ask you to enter this command: docker run -d --name archiveteam --label=com.centurylinklabs.watchtower.enable=true --restart=unless-stopped [image address] --concurrent 1 [username] Make sure to replace the [image address] with the Reddit project address (removing brackets): atdr.meo.ws/archiveteam/reddit-grab Also change the [username] to whatever you'd like, no need to register for anything. More information about running this project: Information about setting up the project ArchiveTeam Wiki page on the Reddit project ArchiveTeam IRC Channel for the Reddit Project (#shreddit on hackint) There are a lot more items that are waiting to be queued into the tracker (approximately 758 million), so 150 million is not an accurate number. This is due to Redis limitations - the tracker is a Ruby and Redis monolith that serves multiple projects with around hundreds of millions of items. You can see all the Reddit items here . The maximum concurrency that you can run is 10 per IP (this is stated in the IRC channel topic). 5 works better for datacenter IPs. Information about Docker errors: If you are seeing RSYNC errors: If the error is about max connections (either -1 or 400), then this is normal. This is our (not amazingly intuitive) method of telling clients to try another target server (we have many of them). Just let it retry, it'll work eventually. If the error is not about max connections, please contact ArchiveTeam on IRC. If you are seeing HOSTERRs, check your DNS. We use Quad9 for our containers. If you need support or wish to discuss, contact ArchiveTeam on IRC Information on what ArchiveTeam archives and how to access the data (from u/rewbycraft ): We archive the posts and comments directly with this project. The things being linked to by the posts (and comments) are put in a queue that we'll process once we've got some more spare capacity. After a few days this stuff ends up in the Internet Archive's Wayback Machine. So, if you have an URL, you can put it in there and retrieve the post. (Note: We save the links without any query parameters and generally using permalinks, so if your URL has ?<and other stuff> at the end, remove that. And try to use permalinks if possible.) It takes a few days because there's a lot of processing logic going on behind the scenes. If you want to be sure something is archived and aren't sure we're covering it, feel free to talk to us on IRC. We're trying to archive literally everything. IMPORTANT: Do NOT modify scripts or the Warrior client! Edit 4: We’re over 12 billion links archived. Keep running the warrior/Docker during the blackout we still have a lot of posts left. Check this website to see when a subreddit goes private. Edit 3: Added a more prominent link to the Reddit IRC channel. Added more info about Docker errors and the project data. Edit 2: If you want check how much you've contributed, go to the project tracker website , press \"show all\" and type ctrl/cmd - F (find in page on mobile), and search your username. It should show you the number of items and the size of data that you've archived. Edit 1: Added more project info given by u/signalhunter ."},

I could not get it because they don't distribute for\"Personal viewing\". I created a Discord for anyone interested: https://discord.gg/JD8Je3v"},

I would like to use the homelab PC as a sort of cache drive where when I am at home I can use it, and when I am away I can connect to my backblaze b2 bucket directly from my laptop.  For example, I could open a word doc, make a few changes, and it would sync automatically to my cloud and NAS.  However the cloud would have more storage so I envision a scenario where my laptop would run out of space so I would keep some files \"cloud only\" and they would be on the NAS when at home or in the backblaze cloud when away.  However, some files I might want to only keep in the cloud and not on my laptop or NAS.  Is this possible?"},
{"Title": "looking for something similar to Qsync", "Author": "u/niloproject", "Content": "Hi everyone, I could use some help. I've put together a NAS for my business and I was wondering if there were any alternatives to Qnap Qsync that would work with Truenas. (I also asked this in the truenas server but figured it would hurt to ask here too). The functionality in specific that I'm looking for is the ability to create users that can then establish a two way sync with the server, but similar to with Qsync, there would ideally be a smart sync that would only download what users actually need locally and not anything that isn't necessary to their work so they're not having to deal with terabytes of storage being synced.  They could then work directly on the mounted drive from their machines and anything they create will be synced to everyone and they won't have to worry about manually downloading/duplicating files on the server. When building this I didn't realize how hard it would be to find a tool for this, and everything I've found just isn't very useful. Syncthing is not helpful, its not smart and would require everyone mirror 20tb of files (unless im misunderstanding what it does.) SMB sharing technically works but is too slow for people to work off of for our purposes as our files have huge datarates (multilayer EXR sequences, 1gb a frame kind of stuff).  I'm also experimenting with Google Workspace to see if that works any better for this but I'd figure I'd ask for help before I go down that road. If any of you have any experience with this or could maybe point me to a client-side software that can manage client side downloads from the server in a smart way like Qsync that would be amazing."},

{"Title": "Is there a way to sync between devices using a usb cable?", "Author": "u/vrtqlwlpl", "Content": "Currently there is a programme called Syncthing which enables the wireless syncing of files between devices. It does not store data on the servers - rather, two devices have to be online at the same time for data to be synced. It's been a while so I don't remember the mechanisms through which it operates There are a couple of downsides. First being that wireless syncing is slow, second being that errors are more common with wireless syncing (from my experiences). Imagine a folder and imagine that every day I make a few changes to the files within it. I need the ability to sync all the changes within the folder for 2 devices. If I do not sync them, I would have to comb the entire folder for every change and apply them one by one OR delete the folder and paste the updated folder from my PC. It is around 50GB so it would take a while to paste I'd probably sync twice a week"},

I was trying to find a python script to automate it, cuz it will take me forever going one by one on tens of thousands of images, but I can't seem to find one that can archive this sort of website. It only goes by pages of 9 and the thumbnail images are shrunk down a ton so you have to click on the image twice to open the full size. Luckily it seems like every thumbnail image shares a name with the source image, but with an added suffix of the preview size, so I imagine it would be possible to have the script delete the underscore and re-add the .jpeg extension. As for going through pages, I'm not so sure on, but if I can input a list of URLs and just batch copy the original URL adding every page number (I know how to do this without a script), I could just use that. I was only going to download AKB48 related images, because most of these images aren't available anywhere else online, and soon won't be anywhere period. They're all old and thus fairly small, so I'm not too worried about it taking a long time to download. If anyone can direct me to a script that can do this or has some other mass image downloading method you're aware of, please let me know. Thanks!"},

Bought a 12 TB External HDD + Backblaze (Computer Backup, not B2) so I can back up my scattered external drives to the big HDD and have that backup automatically to Backblaze.

Many subreddits have agreed to shut down for 48 hours on June 12th, while others will be gone indefinitely unless this issue is resolved. We are archiving Reddit posts so that in the event that the API cost change is never addressed, we can still access posts from those closed subreddits. Here is how you can help: Choose the \"host\" that matches your current PC, probably Windows or macOS Download ArchiveTeam Warrior In VirtualBox, click File > Import Appliance and open the file. Start the virtual machine. It will fetch the latest updates and will eventually tell you to start your web browser. Once you’ve started your warrior: Go to http://localhost:8001/ and check the Settings page. Choose a username — we’ll show your progress on the leaderboard. Go to the \"All projects\" tab and select ArchiveTeam’s Choice to let your warrior work on the most urgent project. (This will be Reddit). Alternative Method: Docker Download Docker on your \"host\" (Windows, macOS, Linux) Follow the instructions on the ArchiveTeam website to set up Docker When setting up the project container, it will ask you to enter this command: docker run -d --name archiveteam --label=com.centurylinklabs.watchtower.enable=true --restart=unless-stopped [image address] --concurrent 1 [username] Make sure to replace the [image address] with the Reddit project address (removing brackets): atdr.meo.ws/archiveteam/reddit-grab Also change the [username] to whatever you'd like, no need to register for anything. More information about running this project: Information about setting up the project ArchiveTeam Wiki page on the Reddit project ArchiveTeam IRC Channel for the Reddit Project (#shreddit on hackint) There are a lot more items that are waiting to be queued into the tracker (approximately 758 million), so 150 million is not an accurate number. This is due to Redis limitations - the tracker is a Ruby and Redis monolith that serves multiple projects with around hundreds of millions of items. You can see all the Reddit items here . The maximum concurrency that you can run is 10 per IP (this is stated in the IRC channel topic). 5 works better for datacenter IPs. Information about Docker errors: If you are seeing RSYNC errors: If the error is about max connections (either -1 or 400), then this is normal. This is our (not amazingly intuitive) method of telling clients to try another target server (we have many of them). Just let it retry, it'll work eventually. If the error is not about max connections, please contact ArchiveTeam on IRC. If you are seeing HOSTERRs, check your DNS. We use Quad9 for our containers. If you need support or wish to discuss, contact ArchiveTeam on IRC Information on what ArchiveTeam archives and how to access the data (from u/rewbycraft ): We archive the posts and comments directly with this project. The things being linked to by the posts (and comments) are put in a queue that we'll process once we've got some more spare capacity. After a few days this stuff ends up in the Internet Archive's Wayback Machine. So, if you have an URL, you can put it in there and retrieve the post. (Note: We save the links without any query parameters and generally using permalinks, so if your URL has ?<and other stuff> at the end, remove that. And try to use permalinks if possible.) It takes a few days because there's a lot of processing logic going on behind the scenes. If you want to be sure something is archived and aren't sure we're covering it, feel free to talk to us on IRC. We're trying to archive literally everything. IMPORTANT: Do NOT modify scripts or the Warrior client! Edit 4: We’re over 12 billion links archived. Keep running the warrior/Docker during the blackout we still have a lot of posts left. Check this website to see when a subreddit goes private. Edit 3: Added a more prominent link to the Reddit IRC channel. Added more info about Docker errors and the project data. Edit 2: If you want check how much you've contributed, go to the project tracker website , press \"show all\" and type ctrl/cmd - F (find in page on mobile), and search your username. It should show you the number of items and the size of data that you've archived. Edit 1: Added more project info given by u/signalhunter ."},

Information about Docker errors: If you are seeing RSYNC errors: If the error is about max connections (either -1 or 400), then this is normal. This is our (not amazingly intuitive) method of telling clients to try another target server (we have many of them). Just let it retry, it'll work eventually. If the error is not about max connections, please contact ArchiveTeam on IRC. If you are seeing HOSTERRs, check your DNS. We use Quad9 for our containers. If you need support or wish to discuss, contact ArchiveTeam on IRC Information on what ArchiveTeam archives and how to access the data (from u/rewbycraft ): We archive the posts and comments directly with this project. The things being linked to by the posts (and comments) are put in a queue that we'll process once we've got some more spare capacity. After a few days this stuff ends up in the Internet Archive's Wayback Machine. So, if you have an URL, you can put it in there and retrieve the post. (Note: We save the links without any query parameters and generally using permalinks, so if your URL has ?<and other stuff> at the end, remove that. And try to use permalinks if possible.) It takes a few days because there's a lot of processing logic going on behind the scenes. If you want to be sure something is archived and aren't sure we're covering it, feel free to talk to us on IRC. We're trying to archive literally everything. IMPORTANT: Do NOT modify scripts or the Warrior client! Edit 4: We’re over 12 billion links archived. Keep running the warrior/Docker during the blackout we still have a lot of posts left. Check this website to see when a subreddit goes private. Edit 3: Added a more prominent link to the Reddit IRC channel. Added more info about Docker errors and the project data. Edit 2: If you want check how much you've contributed, go to the project tracker website , press \"show all\" and type ctrl/cmd - F (find in page on mobile), and search your username. It should show you the number of items and the size of data that you've archived. Edit 1: Added more project info given by u/signalhunter ."},

{"Title": "\"The Truth is Paywalled But the Lies Are Free\": Notes on why I hoard data", "Author": "u/gabefair", "Content": "I came across a beautifully written article by Nathan J. Robinson about how quality work costs money to access and propaganda is freely given. The article makes some good points on why it is important for data to be more free, which I will summarize below: Nobody is allowed to build a giant free database of everything human beings have ever produced. 2) Copyright law can be an intensive restriction on the freedom of speech and determines what information you can (and not) share with others. 3) The concept of a public community library needs to evolve. As books, and other content move online, our communities have as well. 4)  Human creativity and potential is phenomenally leashed when human knowledge is limited. 5) Free and affordable libraries/sources of wisdom are dying. This got me thinking about why I care about hoarding data. Data is invaluable! A digital dark age is forming around us and we can do what we can to prevent it. A lot of people here will hoard data for personal reasons. I hoard data for others. The things the people in this subreddit hoard whether it be movies, Youtube, pictures, news articles, websites, all of it is culture. Its history. Even memes and social media are not crap. Even literal shit is valuable to a scatologist. Can you imagine if we were able to find the preserved excrement from a long extinct animal? What one sees as shit, is so much more to someone else who is trained and educated. Its data. The internet and social media around us is Art and Culture from our time. This is history for the future to use and learn. Things go viral for a reason. The information shared in the jokes and content are snapshots of the public's thinking and perspective on the world. Invaluable data for future scholars. Imagine we found a Viking warship and on it was a perfectly preserved book of jokes. Sure many at the time might have thought they were shit jokes made at the expense of others. But we would learn so much about their customs, society, and the evolution of human civilization if this book was preserved and found. And the book's contents were made available to the world. Also a lot of political content is shared on social media and comment sections as well. Our understanding of politics  will be carved up in units of memes, and shared on thousands of siloed paywalled platforms and mediums over time. And our role is to collect and consolidate them. This is but a small sliver of the documentation of how our world is changing around us. And we can do our part to save and make free to others as much of it as we can. P.S. Many reddit accounts unknowingly (like maybe yours) are being used by bots to vote for content. Please enable 2FA to stop this practice. Instructions P.P.S. Summer of 2020 is time for contingency preparedness. There is no time to get started like the present. Buy your disks now to be prepared for when history needs you. P.P.P.S. Thank you all for the support and discussion so far. You are some good folks! A song that I enjoy due to it relating to the importance preserving history is \"Amnesia\" by Dead Can Dance. It has a line in the song that I find quite chilling, \"Can you really plan the future when you no longer have the past?\" P.P.P.P.S. Some people like to use the plural verb \"data are\" instead of the singular \"data is\" since data are used to refer to a collection. \"The fish are being collected\". I merely mention this as a factoid in celebration of this discussion receiving so much attention. P.P.P.P.P.S. Take a look at this list of site-deaths to remind us of all the now dead sites that once existed. P.P.P.P.P.P.S For further motivation, consider how: Facebook is deleting evidence of war crimes"},

{"Title": "\"The Truth is Paywalled But the Lies Are Free\": Notes on why I hoard data", "Author": "u/gabefair", "Content": "I came across a beautifully written article by Nathan J. Robinson about how quality work costs money to access and propaganda is freely given. The article makes some good points on why it is important for data to be more free, which I will summarize below: Nobody is allowed to build a giant free database of everything human beings have ever produced. 2) Copyright law can be an intensive restriction on the freedom of speech and determines what information you can (and not) share with others. 3) The concept of a public community library needs to evolve. As books, and other content move online, our communities have as well. 4)  Human creativity and potential is phenomenally leashed when human knowledge is limited. 5) Free and affordable libraries/sources of wisdom are dying. This got me thinking about why I care about hoarding data. Data is invaluable! A digital dark age is forming around us and we can do what we can to prevent it. A lot of people here will hoard data for personal reasons. I hoard data for others. The things the people in this subreddit hoard whether it be movies, Youtube, pictures, news articles, websites, all of it is culture. Its history. Even memes and social media are not crap. Even literal shit is valuable to a scatologist. Can you imagine if we were able to find the preserved excrement from a long extinct animal? What one sees as shit, is so much more to someone else who is trained and educated. Its data. The internet and social media around us is Art and Culture from our time. This is history for the future to use and learn. Things go viral for a reason. The information shared in the jokes and content are snapshots of the public's thinking and perspective on the world. Invaluable data for future scholars. Imagine we found a Viking warship and on it was a perfectly preserved book of jokes. Sure many at the time might have thought they were shit jokes made at the expense of others. But we would learn so much about their customs, society, and the evolution of human civilization if this book was preserved and found. And the book's contents were made available to the world. Also a lot of political content is shared on social media and comment sections as well. Our understanding of politics  will be carved up in units of memes, and shared on thousands of siloed paywalled platforms and mediums over time. And our role is to collect and consolidate them. This is but a small sliver of the documentation of how our world is changing around us. And we can do our part to save and make free to others as much of it as we can. P.S. Many reddit accounts unknowingly (like maybe yours) are being used by bots to vote for content. Please enable 2FA to stop this practice. Instructions P.P.S. Summer of 2020 is time for contingency preparedness. There is no time to get started like the present. Buy your disks now to be prepared for when history needs you. P.P.P.S. Thank you all for the support and discussion so far. You are some good folks! A song that I enjoy due to it relating to the importance preserving history is \"Amnesia\" by Dead Can Dance. It has a line in the song that I find quite chilling, \"Can you really plan the future when you no longer have the past?\" P.P.P.P.S. Some people like to use the plural verb \"data are\" instead of the singular \"data is\" since data are used to refer to a collection. \"The fish are being collected\". I merely mention this as a factoid in celebration of this discussion receiving so much attention. P.P.P.P.P.S. Take a look at this list of site-deaths to remind us of all the now dead sites that once existed. P.P.P.P.P.P.S For further motivation, consider how: Facebook is deleting evidence of war crimes"},

The problem is they seem to be of varying quality almost like shucking a drive. Sometimes they're totally new, sometimes unused old stock and sometimes manufacturer refurbished. My brother got a years old stock that had zero on power hours. However, a review of the seller suggested the following methodology. They were reviewing a 12TB Exos \"According to my tests, this drive is legit. I was able to: Verify the serial number at the Seagate website-  - - -    - Format the drive into 11 partitions. Put files into the first and last 2 partitions and was able to read back the files. Note that the drive has 11,175.98 GB of actual free space. The missing 825 GB may have been allocated to the file mapping table.\" Why do you need to partition it n-1 TB times then write data on the first and last partition? Is this even sound? I think they suggested it because it's quicker and more painless than stress testing the whole drive for a legitimacy test. EDIT. I want to clarify I know the scam of declaring high capacities using a smaller capacity medium. Also most of these drives usually have valid warranties just in a different region when checked via the their respective manufacturers website even the refurbished ones."},

I have been doing this for years but lately I've been trying to streamline and speed up the process. I have a SATA dock installed inside my system (straight SATA, no USB), and when I slot in my old 1TB Crucial MX500 drive, I can run the macrium backup in about 6 minutes. I have lots of spare NVMe drives, so I got one of these Orico 10Gbps USB 3.2 NVMe enclosures ( https://www.amazon.com/ORICO-NVMe-Thunderbolt-Compatible-SSDs-PWM2-BK/dp/B0BJ23JTXX ) several months ago and it has worked fine for transferring files. However, when I run the same macrium backup as before to this NVMe drive it seems to hang for a second, then shows an estimate of 6 minutes, then within a few seconds the transfer rate drops from 1+gbps to under 100mbps and the estimated time shoots up to 55 minutes. You would think that the symptoms point to a crappy USB enclosure or a problem with the drive... but when I copy the same image file directly from the SATA drive to the NVMe drive manually in Windows the transfer rate is pegged at over 550MB\\sec (megabytes) and it is done in just over a minute. Is there something I can adjust in Macrium or elsewhere that would fix this seeming incompatibility with this NVMe USB enclosure? I'd love to use it (to free up my old 1TB MX500) but having to wait nearly 10 times as long for backups is unacceptable. Thank you for any help you can offer."},

Expert advice needed 🫠", "Author": "u/Positive_Minds", "Content": "This 4TB drive and also my 10 year old 2TB HGST drive. have popped up bad and weak sectors , they haven’t been switched on in 10 years .. So was this basically my fault for not powering them up every and using disk fresh etc or is it just a case of age related demagnetisation or mechanical failure ? I just don’t get as most of my 10 year old western digital drives or seagate have been fine when tested after 10 years I’m seriously thinking of doing yearly refreshes of my drives from now on .. My other question is can the weak sectors be reallocated or removed ? I read this on super user , is this true ? In order to keep the data signal from fading, you need to re-write the data. This is often known as “hard disk maintenance”, and should be done 3 or 4 times a year. While it does not prevent data from being corrupted or deleted, it can go a long way towards ensuring that the magnetic signal does not fade away completely. The way it works is to read every sector of the drive, and then re-write the data found there, provided the drive reported no errors. If this is done on a regular basis, the magnetic signal of every part of the drive will be refreshed long before the signal fades or becomes ambiguous. This technique also gives the drive controller the opportunity to decide whether to retire any sectors that are becoming too unreliable, before any important data is lost. Magnetic Field Breakdown Most sources state that permanent magnets lose their magnetic field strength at a rate of 1% per year. Assuming this is valid, after ~69 years, we can assume that half of the sectors in a hard drive would be corrupted (since they all lost half of their strength by this time). Obviously, this is quite a long time, but this risk is easily mitigated - simply re-write the data to the drive. How frequently you need to do this depends on the following two issues (I also go over this in my conclusion). To periodically refresh the data on the drive, simply transfer it to another location, and re-writing it back to the drive. That way, the magnetic domains in the physical disk surface will be renewed with their original strength (because you just re-wrote the files back to the disk). If you're concerned about filesystem corruption, you can also format the disk before transferring the data back. You can also help to avoid this issue by archiving your data with recovery data and error correction when you put the data onto the drive. Many archive formats support the inclusion of data recovery algorithms, so even if you have a few corrupted sectors, you can still re-build the lost data. Depending on the priority of the data you've stored, you may want to refresh the hard disk more often. If it is essential data, I would recommend no less then 2 years at maximum. If you can withstand some chance of minor data loss (e.g. a few corrupted sectors here and there), go with 5 years. It doesn't take long to copy the data off the drive, and copy it back. One thing not considered is the servo tracks and markings. These are written one time at the factory and never again (on modern disks). No amount of re-writes by the user or so-called low-level formatting freshens these. Once they fade, they fade! It's different with the first stepper motor disks of the 80's. They don't have servo tracks and a low-level format writes ALL of the bits - fresh."},

{"Title": "A New Idea for Data Storage: Combining Piezoelectric Materials and 3D NAND", "Author": "u/Mysterious_Crazy9606", "Content": "Hey everyone, I’ve been thinking about a new way to revolutionize data storage by combining piezoelectric materials with 3D NAND technology. Here’s the gist of my idea: The Concept •\tHigh-Speed Piezoelectric Module: Use piezoelectric crystals that can oscillate at frequencies in the gigahertz range as an ultra-fast data buffer. This could potentially give us read and write speeds way beyond what we have with current tech. •\tMain 3D NAND Storage: Use 3D NAND for the main long-term storage. We all know it’s reliable and has a high capacity. How It Would Work 1.\tWriting Data: Incoming data would first go to the piezoelectric module at super high speeds. 2.\tTransferring Data: The data would then be transferred to the main 3D NAND storage for long-term keeping. 3.\tReading Data: For reads, the system would first check the piezoelectric buffer for quick access. If the data isn’t there, it would pull from the 3D NAND storage. Benefits •\tSpeed: This setup could drastically reduce latency and boost read/write speeds. •\tEnergy Efficiency: Piezoelectric materials might be more energy-efficient for rapid operations. •\tNew Storage Architecture: Combining the speed of piezoelectrics with the capacity of 3D NAND could create a super-efficient storage solution. Challenges •\tTech Integration: Making sure the piezoelectric and 3D NAND components work seamlessly together. •\tCost: High-quality piezoelectric materials and the complexity of this setup might be pricey. •\tDurability and Reliability: The materials need to handle high-frequency oscillations over long periods without wearing out. Potential Impact If we can make this work, it could be a game-changer for data centers, mobile devices, and industrial applications that need ultra-fast response times. What do you all think? Could this actually work?"},

I'm running Linux and using mdadm to run 3 arrays. Before I attached any of my drives with data and arrays configured, I installed the card with no drives attached and update the firmware to 16.00.12.00 , and made sure it was in IT mode.  As a test I then connected one of my arrays to the controller and booted the system.  After booting up, the drives were detected fine (4 x 2TB) but the array was gone.  It appears that the metadata was erased, mdadm didn't recognize any drive as being part of an array. I was able to recover the data and the array by following the steps here: https://raid.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/Recovering_a_damaged_RAID However, if I reboot again the same thing happens, the metadata is lost and mdadm does not recognize that the drives are part of an array.   I do not have this issue with the older LSI controllers. Any idea what's going on here?  When I created the array I used the entre drive, so I did not create a Linux RAID partition on each drive.  The array is configured using /dev/sda to /dev/sdd, and not /dev/sda1 to /dev/sdd1.  Not sure that has anything to do with it. Edit:  Seems to be an issue with the controller and GPT partition tables.  As a test, I created an array with a couple 120gb SSD's I had laying around.  I created the array with the whole drive, rebooted, and after a reboot the array was still present.  I realized my other drives are configured as GPT.  So I wiped the SSDs, switched them to GPT and again created the array.  This time after a reboot the array was gone, mdadm does not recognize the drives as being part of an array.

I had some extra PSUs and fans and supermicro trays so I figured why not design around that. I've probably put no less than 40+ hours into design, print, redesign, print, try fitment etc. Not the most experience with Fusion360 or CAD in general. The front LEDs do light up during activity :). I've been thinking of expanding this into a mATX or Mini-ITX supported case as well. I know this is also pretty much on the heals of shaztech_info but I think we have enough differences between us and I was kinda shocked to see someone else coming out with a similar idea around the same time lol. Let me know what you fellas and fellettes think! From Makerworld: I was unable to find a product that met my specifications of 8 hot-swap bays, a SAS backplane and external SAS connectors for easy connectivity, so I decided to design and build my own 8-bay Direct Attached Storage (DAS). This DAS features a Supermicro SAS833TQ backplane with Gen 5.5 hot-swap 3.5\" trays. It is powered by either a 200W PWS-203-1H (as-shown) or a 350W PWS-351-1H (or similar units of the same dimensions: PWS-351-1H 100 x 40 x 220mm, PWS-203-1H 76 x 40.3 x 192mm) power supply. Additionally, it includes an external SAS SFF-8088 to SFF-8087 adapter to cut down on internal wires. I printed this on my X1C and have realized that making it available for smaller print beds should also be done instead of 1 large single print. The body is 255 W x 190 H x 245mm D, it is printed as a single print, no supports needed. The body at 10% infill, 2 walls with gyroid infill .20mm layer height with a 0.4mm nozzle. This print requires NO supports to print. The print of the body will use approximately 984.5g of filament if no painting is done of the logo or numbers, and 982.6g if painted of a single color. This print took roughly 20 hours to print. I realize this might also be a turn off being a large print but I wasn't wanting to have to glue or screw it together if I could help it. If you are wanting this, let me know and I can work it into a new version. There are 2 version of the back plate for the different sizes of PSUs mentioned. Here is the list of parts used for this build: Part Price Supermicro Gen 5.5 3.5\" trays (MCP-220-00075-0B) x8 ~$50 for 8 on eBay Supermicro SAS833TQ 8-bay SAS backplane ~$35 on eBay SFF-8087 to SATA breakout cable x2 ~$16 SFF-8088 to SFF-8087 adapter ~$30 Supermicro 1U PSU of dimensions 100 x 40 x 220mm or 76 x 40.3 x 192mm (As seen PWS-203-1H) ~32$ on eBay, also designed screw hole for PWS-351-1H ~$30 on eBay Molex Y-cable ~$6 120mm of your choice x2 (Noctua NF-P12 shown) ~$16 ea.

Assume both of these scenarios are basic setups without drive pools or raid. The redditor suggests and recommends that using a single SSD with a partition for the OS and Data drive is more safe than using dual drives.

I suggested using two separate SSDs, and the redditor said that this indeed doubles the chances of drive failure due to two drives. I disagreed and said that it halves it due to the decreased reads and writes. I also suggested that dual drives will make it easier to restore a backup drive if one fails. Which scenario is better?

A recent Reddit policy change threatens to kill many beloved third-party mobile apps, making a great many quality-of-life features not seen in the official mobile app permanently inaccessible to users. On May 31, 2023, Reddit announced they were raising the price to make calls to their API from being free to a level that will kill every third party app on Reddit, from Apollo to Reddit is Fun to Narwhal to BaconReader . Even if you're not a mobile user and don't use any of those apps, this is a step toward killing other ways of customizing Reddit, such as Reddit Enhancement Suite or the use of the old.reddit.com desktop interface . This isn't only a problem on the user level: many subreddit moderators depend on tools only available outside the official app to keep their communities on-topic and spam-free. What's the plan? On June 12th, many subreddits will be going dark to protest this policy. Some will return after 48 hours: others will go away permanently unless the issue is adequately addressed, since many moderators aren't able to put in the work they do with the poor tools available through the official app. This isn't something any of us do lightly: we do what we do because we love Reddit , and we truly believe this change will make it impossible to keep doing what we love. The two-day blackout isn't the goal , and it isn't the end. Should things reach the 14th with no sign of Reddit choosing to fix what they've broken, we'll use the community and buzz we've built between then and now as a tool for further action. What can you do? Complain. Message the mods of r/reddit .com, who are the admins of the site: message u/reddit : submit a support request : comment in relevant threads on r/reddit , such as this one , leave a negative review on their official iOS or Android app- and sign your username in support to this post.

Suggest anyone you know who moderates a subreddit join us at our sister sub at r/ModCoord - but please don't pester mods you don't know by simply spamming their modmail. Boycott and spread the word...to Reddit's competition! Stay off Reddit entirely on June 12th through the 13th- instead, take to your favorite non -Reddit platform of choice and make some noise in support! Don't be a jerk. As upsetting this may be, threats, profanity and vandalism will be worse than useless in getting people on our side.

{"Title": "Don't Let Reddit Kill 3rd Party Apps!", "Author": "u/MagicDalsi", "Content": "EDIT: Don't use this post any more: it's been crossposted so widely that it breaks Reddit when trying to open it! It's been locked. Further discussion (and crossposts) should go HERE. What's going on? A recent Reddit policy change threatens to kill many beloved third-party mobile apps, making a great many quality-of-life features not seen in the official mobile app permanently inaccessible to users. On May 31, 2023, Reddit announced they were raising the price to make calls to their API from being free to a level that will kill every third party app on Reddit, from Apollo to Reddit is Fun to Narwhal to BaconReader . Even if you're not a mobile user and don't use any of those apps, this is a step toward killing other ways of customizing Reddit, such as Reddit Enhancement Suite or the use of the old.reddit.com desktop interface . This isn't only a problem on the user level: many subreddit moderators depend on tools only available outside the official app to keep their communities on-topic and spam-free. What's the plan? On June 12th, many subreddits will be going dark to protest this policy. Some will return after 48 hours: others will go away permanently unless the issue is adequately addressed, since many moderators aren't able to put in the work they do with the poor tools available through the official app. This isn't something any of us do lightly: we do what we do because we love Reddit , and we truly believe this change will make it impossible to keep doing what we love. The two-day blackout isn't the goal , and it isn't the end. Should things reach the 14th with no sign of Reddit choosing to fix what they've broken, we'll use the community and buzz we've built between then and now as a tool for further action. What can you do? Complain. Message the mods of r/reddit .com, who are the admins of the site: message u/reddit : submit a support request : comment in relevant threads on r/reddit , such as this one , leave a negative review on their official iOS or Android app- and sign your username in support to this post. Spread the word. Rabble-rouse on related subreddits. Meme it up, make it spicy. Bitch about it to your cat. Suggest anyone you know who moderates a subreddit join us at our sister sub at r/ModCoord - but please don't pester mods you don't know by simply spamming their modmail. Boycott and spread the word...to Reddit's competition! Stay off Reddit entirely on June 12th through the 13th- instead, take to your favorite non -Reddit platform of choice and make some noise in support! Don't be a jerk. As upsetting this may be, threats, profanity and vandalism will be worse than useless in getting people on our side. Please make every effort to be as restrained, polite, reasonable and law-abiding as possible. This includes not harassing moderators of subreddits who have chosen not to take part : no one likes a missionary, a used-car salesman, or a flame warrior."},
{"Title": "\"The Truth is Paywalled But the Lies Are Free\": Notes on why I hoard data", "Author": "u/gabefair", "Content": "I came across a beautifully written article by Nathan J. Robinson about how quality work costs money to access and propaganda is freely given. The article makes some good points on why it is important for data to be more free, which I will summarize below: Nobody is allowed to build a giant free database of everything human beings have ever produced. 2) Copyright law can be an intensive restriction on the freedom of speech and determines what information you can (and not) share with others. 3) The concept of a public community library needs to evolve. As books, and other content move online, our communities have as well. 4)  Human creativity and potential is phenomenally leashed when human knowledge is limited. 5) Free and affordable libraries/sources of wisdom are dying. This got me thinking about why I care about hoarding data. Data is invaluable! A digital dark age is forming around us and we can do what we can to prevent it. A lot of people here will hoard data for personal reasons. I hoard data for others. The things the people in this subreddit hoard whether it be movies, Youtube, pictures, news articles, websites, all of it is culture. Its history. Even memes and social media are not crap. Even literal shit is valuable to a scatologist. Can you imagine if we were able to find the preserved excrement from a long extinct animal? What one sees as shit, is so much more to someone else who is trained and educated. Its data. The internet and social media around us is Art and Culture from our time. This is history for the future to use and learn. Things go viral for a reason. The information shared in the jokes and content are snapshots of the public's thinking and perspective on the world. Invaluable data for future scholars. Imagine we found a Viking warship and on it was a perfectly preserved book of jokes. Sure many at the time might have thought they were shit jokes made at the expense of others. But we would learn so much about their customs, society, and the evolution of human civilization if this book was preserved and found. And the book's contents were made available to the world. Also a lot of political content is shared on social media and comment sections as well. Our understanding of politics  will be carved up in units of memes, and shared on thousands of siloed paywalled platforms and mediums over time. And our role is to collect and consolidate them. This is but a small sliver of the documentation of how our world is changing around us. And we can do our part to save and make free to others as much of it as we can. P.S. Many reddit accounts unknowingly (like maybe yours) are being used by bots to vote for content. Please enable 2FA to stop this practice. Instructions P.P.S. Summer of 2020 is time for contingency preparedness. There is no time to get started like the present. Buy your disks now to be prepared for when history needs you. P.P.P.S. Thank you all for the support and discussion so far. You are some good folks! A song that I enjoy due to it relating to the importance preserving history is \"Amnesia\" by Dead Can Dance. It has a line in the song that I find quite chilling, \"Can you really plan the future when you no longer have the past?\" P.P.P.P.S. Some people like to use the plural verb \"data are\" instead of the singular \"data is\" since data are used to refer to a collection. \"The fish are being collected\". I merely mention this as a factoid in celebration of this discussion receiving so much attention. P.P.P.P.P.S. Take a look at this list of site-deaths to remind us of all the now dead sites that once existed. P.P.P.P.P.P.S For further motivation, consider how: Facebook is deleting evidence of war crimes"},

Expert advice needed 🫠", "Author": "u/Positive_Minds", "Content": "This 4TB drive and also my 10 year old 2TB HGST drive. have popped up bad and weak sectors , they haven’t been switched on in 10 years .. So was this basically my fault for not powering them up every and using disk fresh etc or is it just a case of age related demagnetisation or mechanical failure ? I just don’t get as most of my 10 year old western digital drives or seagate have been fine when tested after 10 years I’m seriously thinking of doing yearly refreshes of my drives from now on .. My other question is can the weak sectors be reallocated or removed ? I read this on super user , is this true ? In order to keep the data signal from fading, you need to re-write the data. This is often known as “hard disk maintenance”, and should be done 3 or 4 times a year. While it does not prevent data from being corrupted or deleted, it can go a long way towards ensuring that the magnetic signal does not fade away completely. The way it works is to read every sector of the drive, and then re-write the data found there, provided the drive reported no errors. If this is done on a regular basis, the magnetic signal of every part of the drive will be refreshed long before the signal fades or becomes ambiguous. This technique also gives the drive controller the opportunity to decide whether to retire any sectors that are becoming too unreliable, before any important data is lost. Magnetic Field Breakdown Most sources state that permanent magnets lose their magnetic field strength at a rate of 1% per year. Assuming this is valid, after ~69 years, we can assume that half of the sectors in a hard drive would be corrupted (since they all lost half of their strength by this time). Obviously, this is quite a long time, but this risk is easily mitigated - simply re-write the data to the drive. How frequently you need to do this depends on the following two issues (I also go over this in my conclusion). To periodically refresh the data on the drive, simply transfer it to another location, and re-writing it back to the drive. That way, the magnetic domains in the physical disk surface will be renewed with their original strength (because you just re-wrote the files back to the disk). If you're concerned about filesystem corruption, you can also format the disk before transferring the data back. You can also help to avoid this issue by archiving your data with recovery data and error correction when you put the data onto the drive. Many archive formats support the inclusion of data recovery algorithms, so even if you have a few corrupted sectors, you can still re-build the lost data. Depending on the priority of the data you've stored, you may want to refresh the hard disk more often. If it is essential data, I would recommend no less then 2 years at maximum. If you can withstand some chance of minor data loss (e.g. a few corrupted sectors here and there), go with 5 years. It doesn't take long to copy the data off the drive, and copy it back. One thing not considered is the servo tracks and markings. These are written one time at the factory and never again (on modern disks). No amount of re-writes by the user or so-called low-level formatting freshens these. Once they fade, they fade! It's different with the first stepper motor disks of the 80's. They don't have servo tracks and a low-level format writes ALL of the bits - fresh."},

{"Title": "A New Idea for Data Storage: Combining Piezoelectric Materials and 3D NAND", "Author": "u/Mysterious_Crazy9606", "Content": "Hey everyone, I’ve been thinking about a new way to revolutionize data storage by combining piezoelectric materials with 3D NAND technology. Here’s the gist of my idea: The Concept •\tHigh-Speed Piezoelectric Module: Use piezoelectric crystals that can oscillate at frequencies in the gigahertz range as an ultra-fast data buffer. This could potentially give us read and write speeds way beyond what we have with current tech. •\tMain 3D NAND Storage: Use 3D NAND for the main long-term storage. We all know it’s reliable and has a high capacity. How It Would Work 1.\tWriting Data: Incoming data would first go to the piezoelectric module at super high speeds. 2.\tTransferring Data: The data would then be transferred to the main 3D NAND storage for long-term keeping. 3.\tReading Data: For reads, the system would first check the piezoelectric buffer for quick access. If the data isn’t there, it would pull from the 3D NAND storage. Benefits •\tSpeed: This setup could drastically reduce latency and boost read/write speeds. •\tEnergy Efficiency: Piezoelectric materials might be more energy-efficient for rapid operations. •\tNew Storage Architecture: Combining the speed of piezoelectrics with the capacity of 3D NAND could create a super-efficient storage solution. Challenges •\tTech Integration: Making sure the piezoelectric and 3D NAND components work seamlessly together. •\tCost: High-quality piezoelectric materials and the complexity of this setup might be pricey. •\tDurability and Reliability: The materials need to handle high-frequency oscillations over long periods without wearing out. Potential Impact If we can make this work, it could be a game-changer for data centers, mobile devices, and industrial applications that need ultra-fast response times. What do you all think? Could this actually work?"},

Before I attached any of my drives with data and arrays configured, I installed the card with no drives attached and update the firmware to 16.00.12.00 , and made sure it was in IT mode.  As a test I then connected one of my arrays to the controller and booted the system.  After booting up, the drives were detected fine (4 x 2TB) but the array was gone.  It appears that the metadata was erased, mdadm didn't recognize any drive as being part of an array. I was able to recover the data and the array by following the steps here: https://raid.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/Recovering_a_damaged_RAID However, if I reboot again the same thing happens, the metadata is lost and mdadm does not recognize that the drives are part of an array.   I do not have this issue with the older LSI controllers. Any idea what's going on here?  When I created the array I used the entre drive, so I did not create a Linux RAID partition on each drive.  The array is configured using /dev/sda to /dev/sdd, and not /dev/sda1 to /dev/sdd1.  Not sure that has anything to do with it. Edit:  Seems to be an issue with the controller and GPT partition tables.  As a test, I created an array with a couple 120gb SSD's I had laying around.  I created the array with the whole drive, rebooted, and after a reboot the array was still present.  I realized my other drives are configured as GPT.  So I wiped the SSDs, switched them to GPT and again created the array.  This time after a reboot the array was gone, mdadm does not recognize the drives as being part of an array.

I had some extra PSUs and fans and supermicro trays so I figured why not design around that. I've probably put no less than 40+ hours into design, print, redesign, print, try fitment etc. Not the most experience with Fusion360 or CAD in general. The front LEDs do light up during activity :). I've been thinking of expanding this into a mATX or Mini-ITX supported case as well. I know this is also pretty much on the heals of shaztech_info but I think we have enough differences between us and I was kinda shocked to see someone else coming out with a similar idea around the same time lol. Let me know what you fellas and fellettes think! From Makerworld: I was unable to find a product that met my specifications of 8 hot-swap bays, a SAS backplane and external SAS connectors for easy connectivity, so I decided to design and build my own 8-bay Direct Attached Storage (DAS). This DAS features a Supermicro SAS833TQ backplane with Gen 5.5 hot-swap 3.5\" trays. It is powered by either a 200W PWS-203-1H (as-shown) or a 350W PWS-351-1H (or similar units of the same dimensions: PWS-351-1H 100 x 40 x 220mm, PWS-203-1H 76 x 40.3 x 192mm) power supply. Additionally, it includes an external SAS SFF-8088 to SFF-8087 adapter to cut down on internal wires. I printed this on my X1C and have realized that making it available for smaller print beds should also be done instead of 1 large single print. The body is 255 W x 190 H x 245mm D, it is printed as a single print, no supports needed. The body at 10% infill, 2 walls with gyroid infill .20mm layer height with a 0.4mm nozzle. This print requires NO supports to print. The print of the body will use approximately 984.5g of filament if no painting is done of the logo or numbers, and 982.6g if painted of a single color. This print took roughly 20 hours to print. I realize this might also be a turn off being a large print but I wasn't wanting to have to glue or screw it together if I could help it. If you are wanting this, let me know and I can work it into a new version. There are 2 version of the back plate for the different sizes of PSUs mentioned. Here is the list of parts used for this build: Part Price Supermicro Gen 5.5 3.5\" trays (MCP-220-00075-0B) x8 ~$50 for 8 on eBay Supermicro SAS833TQ 8-bay SAS backplane ~$35 on eBay SFF-8087 to SATA breakout cable x2 ~$16 SFF-8088 to SFF-8087 adapter ~$30 Supermicro 1U PSU of dimensions 100 x 40 x 220mm or 76 x 40.3 x 192mm (As seen PWS-203-1H) ~32$ on eBay, also designed screw hole for PWS-351-1H ~$30 on eBay Molex Y-cable ~$6 120mm of your choice x2 (Noctua NF-P12 shown) ~$16 ea.

The redditor suggests and recommends that using a single SSD with a partition for the OS and Data drive is more safe than using dual drives.

I suggested using two separate SSDs, and the redditor said that this indeed doubles the chances of drive failure due to two drives. I disagreed and said that it halves it due to the decreased reads and writes. I also suggested that dual drives will make it easier to restore a backup drive if one fails. Which scenario is better?

For the third one, he didn't even receive an email or notification yet for what video he got taken down. http://sempervideo.de/youtube-hat-sempervideo-geloescht/ Edit 2: The channel is backup. Just for how long If their ridiculous policy and bots are still up. https://twitter.com/SemperVideo/status/1352708103125561344 https://www.youtube.com/user/SemperVideo Edit 3: So the channel is up again, but he still has the previous two strikes from the VPN video and the win 10 video. So It's just a matter of time again till another video will get a strike again. And If you don't know after 3 strikes on YouTube, your channels get deleted. That's what happened here. His perspective(german): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZiYLPjCWoXU In summary, he already deleted over 1k videos from YouTube after he received the second strike a few weeks ago. But with over a few thousand videos you can't really pinpoint which videos will get you maybe a strike again. If a user reports a video from him, a \"YouTube Specialist\" will look at the video who doesn't know shit about IT and then says: \"Yeah, that could be dangerous\" so here you have a strike. And after 3 you're gone."},

{"Title": "My home backup method is bad. I need help re-thinking it.", "Author": "u/Zach83", "Content": "I don't know a lot about networking, storage, and proper backing up. I'm a 3d artist and do some coding on the side so I don't get scared by technical manuals or learning new tech, but proper sys adminning is not my strength. I just did some reading on things like windows backup and mirroring and now I think I need to update/change/modernize how I backup my stuff. Apparently the things I am relying on are NOT reliable at all. So I dove in and now I can't see the forest for the trees anymore. I need help thinking this out. My current setup I have a work/gaming pc with 2 2TB drives and a synology 1 disk(2TB) NAS device. The windows PC contains important data, the NAS serves media to a media pc(that needs no backing up) and some tablets To back these up I have a windows based \"NAS\" with 2 mirrored volumes, F and G. 2 4TB volumes (so 4 disks, 4TB each, 2 used for each mirorred volume) On the Work PC there are three folders that I manually backup to G while working. Daily backups sort off. Every week I run a Bat file with a few robocopy commands on the windows \"NAS\". The BAT maps the work PC's drives and the synology NAS drive and then does a copy with options like /mir and /purge. Essentially an incremental backup of the NAS and work PC drives to the windows \"NAS\". A few times a year a I run a second bat script. It copies everything to external devices that I store in my shed. Best offsite backup available to me. my questions How to mirror? Apparently windows mirrored volumes can not be relied on? I use it to protect against disk failure and apparently there are situations where the still working disk will NOT be read by another windows pc. Kinda defeats the point. I want such protection on the windows \"NAS\", an automatic and fast mirror copy. I want to be able to put any disk of the mirror pair in any other windows pc and have it appear like a normal disk, so it should be NTFS. What should I do? There are so many options and I have no idea what is reliable. How to backup without Robocopy (in a file system that windows can read like ntfs, and without puting files into a proprietary binary blob)? I'm told I shouldn't use Robocopy for incremental backups because it's too easy to fuck up, and should power cut out while copying I could be fucked. Googling I went, searching for a way with the following requirements: I want to backup the synology nas and the 2 disks on the work pc weekly, to the windows \"NAS\". I only want to copy changed or new files and I want to remove files that no longer exist in the original source. The backup should not go into a binary blob, I want loose files. No need for file versions/history. Timestamps(date modifed/created) are important to me. And I found nothing. I probably don't even know the right terms to search for. How should I do this backup? Ideally this should not involve signing up for a service or managed via a web interface hosted by some company. I want to keep everything in home and away from the internet. Free would be nice too."},

While trying to get footage from my camcorder, I noticed the audio and video footage stops getting captured on my PC when the tracking gets real messy, even if only for a couple seconds, and it ruins lots of the tape. Any suggestions for a capturing device which can handle any sort of tracking that may be required by the tapes? To note, I'm using a Sony CCD-TRV57, which uses VHS-C tapes (they're a compact form of regular VHS tapes)."},

{"Title": "Advice/guidance needed for a first time NAS builder", "Author": "u/de4thr4sher", "Content": "Hello everyone! I've been lurking around here for quite some time and all I'll say is that I've been inspired by your posts so much that I've decided to dive into the realm of building my first NAS and be a data hoarder myself. But I'll need your help with that as I've been very confused with a lot of things and obviously, I don't want to screw everything up. So, first things first. My intention with the setup is purely just hoarding data on a separate machine other than my main PC while i keep everything safe and secure as much as possible. I don't need it to be accessible from anywhere or anything like that, just locally from my main PC. Like an enormous external HDD to put it simply. I don't need crazy speeds either as I won't be using it for work or anything similar. It's main use will be storing and playing my audio/video files from there and ofc, store a lot of other files and having backups of my main system and other devices. I'll be starting with the hardware I already own and the ones I plan on buying (suggestions are welcome ofc) *Already owned hardware* Option 1 for mobo/CPU/RAM would be my old setup: A Z390-E paired with a 9700k (8C/8T) and 32GB (DDR4-3000) of RAM Option 2 would be a setup I got recently for free: An Asus ROG Maximus VII paired with a 4790k (4C/8T) and 16GB (DDR3-1600). A 700W Coolermaster PSU that I also got with the free setup, an old spare Kingston SSDNow V300 240GB and if I manage to finally build this NAS, I'll be getting rid of a 4TB WD drive and an 8TB Ironwolf drive. Will I have to use the 9700k setup in this case or even the 4790k will be enough? *Hardware I plan on buying* The goal for now is to get 4 drives so I can have 2 of them for redundancy and add another 4 next year and hopefully I won't have a storage issue for a long time. I've locked my eyes on Exos X16 14TB and on X18 16TB drives and a Define 7 XL R2 case for this whole setup as all these are in a fairly good price right now where I'm from. Seagate lists these drives as CMR so I guess shouldn't be concerned...? Later on I know I'll also have to get a Pci-e to 4x sata or something like that. That's about it as far as hardware goes. Let's dive into software now, shall we? The most confusing part for me and where I need your advice the most. What should I go for? I see a lot of people recommending unRAID for basic setups like this. I got very confused when I was trying to decide between that or TrueNAS and eventually I gave it up and decided to ask the experts here. What would you do? Is it worth spending extra for an unRAID licence? I know this post is stupid for 99.8% of you but it's obviously not my field of expertise and I'm trying to not spend anywhere else right now, except mainly for HDDs and a case. Suggestions AND roasts are welcome! :) Thanks in advance!"},

Occasionally they will happen and this just ensures things keep moving along as intended. Don't worry, the next time it is ran any videos that didn't fully download will most likely be picked right back up where it left off! --add-metadata --all-subs --embed-subs --embed-thumbnail These just embed metadata into the video once it's done downloading. You never know when this will come in handy, and having it all right in the video's container is nice. Just a little note, at the time of writing this post, ffmpeg can't embed images into a mkv, but the image is still downloaded and stored in the same location and with the same name as the video. --match-filter \"playlist_title != 'Liked videos' & playlist_title != 'Favorites'\" This will filter videos out that you don't want to download. Here is just a basic example of filtering out playlists with the title \"Liked Videos\" and \"Favorites\". I find this especially useful for filtering out playlists that contain a bunch of videos from other playlists. For example, if I'm downloading videos from a gaming channel and they have a playlist for \"Gmod\" and one for \"Minecraft PC\", but they also have one called \"PC Games\" that contains the contents of both the Gmod and the Minecraft playlists, I sometimes will want to keep those separate, so I will filter out the \"PC Games\" playlist. If there are videos in that playlist you still want, you can always add another youtube-dl command to your script with that playlist specifically. Depending on the channel, this can get rather annoying to manage, but its a good way to keep things better organized. -f \"(bestvideo[vcodec^=av01][height>=1080][fps>30]/bestvideo[vcodec=vp9.2][height>=1080] [fps>30]/bestvideo[vcodec=vp9][height>=1080][fps>30]/bestvideo[vcodec^=av01] [height>=1080]/bestvideo[vcodec=vp9.2][height>=1080]/bestvideo[vcodec=vp9] [height>=1080]/bestvideo[height>=1080]/bestvideo[vcodec^=av01][height>=720] [fps>30]/bestvideo[vcodec=vp9.2][height>=720][fps>30]/bestvideo[vcodec=vp9][height>=720] [fps>30]/bestvideo[vcodec^=av01][height>=720]/bestvideo[vcodec=vp9.2][height>=720]/ bestvideo[vcodec=vp9][height>=720]/bestvideo[height>=720]/bestvideo)+ (bestaudio[acodec=opus]/bestaudio)/best\" Ok. This is where things get a little tricky. I first want to start off by saying that this isn't totally necessary as all the -f command does is allows you to set preferences on what video and audio streams you want to download. If you want a basic rundown on how this works, the youtube-dl readme explains it better than I ever could. For my case here, I want to download video streams in certain codecs, which have a hierarchy of [av1>vp9.2>vp9>whatever is available]. It will keep going down the list until one is found that meets my criteria. You can also see that I prefer videos in 1080 with more than 30 fps, then 1080 30 fps, and that repeats for 720. I also prefer to get audio in opus if it's available. Just a side note for anyone wondering what vp9.2 is, it is the vp9 codec with HDR. Why bother with all of that nonsense when youtube-dl will automatically pick the best streams for you? Well, the way youtube-dl picks the best stream is based solely on bitrate. This means that for video it will usually chose the avc1 codec, which is pretty old at this point, and while it still looks good, I've found that the other codecs offer a smaller file size and similar or better quality. You may find otherwise and want to do things differently, but for me, this is how I do it as it saves hard drive space and I find the quality good. Also, as you will notice, I don't have any resolutions higher than 1080 on there. The way I have it, it should catch those higher res streams, but as of now, I don't archive many youtubers' videos that upload in higher res so I haven't found the need, but some day I'm sure I will change it. I already know your asking yourself, \"If this will catch the higher resolution streams, why don't you just leave the 720 options in there and remove the 1080?\". Well, it's because I've noticed that youtube has started to transcode many videos to the newer av1 codec, but so far most videos that I've seen only go up to 720 for the av1 codec. This means that if that stream is available, but there isn't a 1080p av1 stream, then it will always download those videos in 720p even if a higher res stream is available. --merge-output-format mkv -o \"%cd%/%%(playlist_uploader)s/%%(playlist)s/%%(playlist_index)s - %%(title)s - %%(id)s.%%(ext)s\" This just tells youtube-dl where I want the file and that I want it in an mkv container. It's pretty self explanatory, but I basically want a folder structure of \"[CHANNEL NAME]/[PLAYLIST NAME]/[PLAYLIST INDEX] - [VIDEO TITLE] - [YOUTUBE VIDEO ID].[EXTENSION]\". Feel free to customize this however you see fit. Please note that I used double % in some of these due to my script being a batch file ran on a windows VM. Things I want to do: - Create a docker container that runs the script. While the Windows VM is working perfect for this, it's the only thing the VM does now (used to be used for much more, but that has all been offloaded). It should be pretty easy since I leave the executables and the script all in a network share as is, so all it would need is the dependencies (which I think is only python if I'm not mistaken) and to set up a cron job. - Simplify the script a bit by using the -a argument. This would allow me to set up a file with the links I want to download. This would allow me to group a bunch of commands that all have the same arguments into 1 command. - Write a script that will move videos that were downloaded before they were put into playlists into their respective playlists once the uploader adds them. Right now what I do is download all of the uploader's playlists, then download all of their videos (using the same archive file so it doesn't re-download any). This means if the uploader is slow to add the video to a playlist, it will just be downloaded to a \"No Playlist\" folder. The other way I could do this would be to find a way to deduplicate all of the videos in the \"No Playlist\" folder and just use separate archive files for the playlist and non playlist videos, which might download some videos twice, but then later deduplicated. Final Thoughts: Youtube-dl is a wonderful and powerful tool, and with all of the crap going down on YouTube, you can never be too sure what videos you love might be taken down. Just what I've managed to download has already helped me and some of my friends out. It definitely is worth your time to automate downloading videos from channels you enjoy, and with a little know-how and experimentation, it doesn't take much time or effort to get something to a point where you can set it and forget it. Anyway, that was certainly longer than I thought it would be, but I really hope it helps some of you guys out. I've gained so much knowledge from this subreddit and it would mean a lot if I gave back and helped one of you out in return. Happy Hoarding! Just a quick edit: Be sure to check out the comments for some excellent ideas and more information on some things! As always, take this information and adapt it to your use case. Maybe my configuration will work perfectly for you, but more than likely you will have to tweak it a bit to get it just right for you. If you have any questions, please ask! Another quick edit: Some of the comments have brought up the fact that us as viewers of YouTube content, and even youtube-dl itself don't have any way to watch or download the original quality of the material as YouTube will automatically transcode videos when they are uploaded. This can be a problem for people who are trying to preserve things in the best quality they possibly can. If you are one of these people, you might want to try looking elsewhere for better quality releases of the content. The one example that immediately comes to mind for me is content from Rooster Teeth. The quality when downloaded directly from their website seems to be better quality than what you can pull from YouTube. For me personally, I will download some movies, and TV Shows and also most music and images in the best possible quality I can find, but when it comes to YouTube content, I just don't care as much and find the convenience of ripping directly from YouTube hard to beat. I also think the content tends to look great, especially for the file sizes, but this is obviously all up to you to decide."},

{"Title": "Live sync of data drive over the internet or simple backup. Lsyncd, DRDB or Kopia backup", "Author": "u/1000Zebras", "Content": "Hi, I'm curious what you guys would implement in this situation in order to, above all, simply maintain at the very least one solid, off-site backup of all of my data files and also, in the event of something happening to my main data drive on-site, reduce downtime as much as possible. Here is my current setup as is relevant to the question at hand: OrangePi 5 Plus running dietpi (so pretty much just debian) as my main server on-site One eMMC boot drive on the OrangePi containing the OS and all of my docker-compose files, as well as the OS itself Recently acquired 14TB external USB drive that houses purely my data for all of my docker containers (and then some outside of those, as well, but not much) OrangePi is running Tailscale A second RPi that lives at my brother's house also running Tailscale (so any connection between the two will more than likely be running over the interwebs, but through Tailscale) and with a second 14tb drive identical to the other connected to it, ready for data storage What I'm wondering is what may be the best strategy for maintaining a backup of the main data drive on the secondary drive, ideally in a mirrored fashion such that were the main drive to fail, I'd simply be able to plug in the secondary drive to the OrangePi, mount it at the same mountpoint as primary would have been, and I'd be back up and running nearly immediately (once the drive was physically moved between locations, of course). It's worth noting that, at present, I am dealing with nearly 4.5TB of data on main data drive (also currently backed up to the cloud via Kopia and iDrive E2) I've been considering: Trying out lsyncd or DRDB in order to literally have the drives mirror each other in as near realtime as the connection will allow. I have not used either of these tools yet, however, so I'm not familiar with exactly how they work behind the scene. And also, I realize that it is a lot of data to keep in sync over an internet connection, especially at file or block-level granularity as I believe those tools are designed for. In \"normal\" usage, I am not necessarily adding or changing all that much data on a day to day basis, but were I to make any major shifts in organization, or simply to add a lot more data into the mix suddenly, I'm wondering if the tools would be able to keep up Running an rsync job over ssh at a specified interval (say, maybe, a couple of times a day) in order to keep the two up date. I would of course again run into the same problem that would arise with the first option were I to make any drastic changes, but theoretically I'd eventually always have a 1 to 1 sync/backup between the two drives Simply running some sort of backup program from the main Orangepi data drive to the RPi's data drive, again at whatever specified interval (say, maybe, daily). I'd probably have to run some sort of webDAV server on the secondary RPi in order to facilitate backups between the two were I to use Kopia. Or, I suppose I could even run the data drive on RPi on a minio instance and have Kopia backup via the S3 protocol, but this seems perhaps like a little bit of overkill, and it wouldn't necessarily be the sort of 1 to 1 sync I'm shooting for as Kopia would organize the backup data in a fashion that it understands. This would be acceptable, though, as again at the end of the day the most important thing is to have all of the data itself stored safely in both locations, one way or another. How would you guys go about keeping things in sync between the two data drives? Or, should I just eschew that idea given the limitations of the bandwidth/connection between the two and go for straight backups using Kopia, or some othe rbackup system? Please, if you have any thoughts on how you'd architect this scenario, I'd very much appreciate any and perspectives/insights. Hopefully that all makes sense. If you need anything clarified, by all means speak up and I'll do my best to address. Thank you so very much for your time, expertise, and patience with my rambling question. I look forward to hearing how people weigh in. Kind Regards, LS"},

Well, it's because I've noticed that youtube has started to transcode many videos to the newer av1 codec, but so far most videos that I've seen only go up to 720 for the av1 codec. This means that if that stream is available, but there isn't a 1080p av1 stream, then it will always download those videos in 720p even if a higher res stream is available. --merge-output-format mkv -o \"%cd%/%%(playlist_uploader)s/%%(playlist)s/%%(playlist_index)s - %%(title)s - %%(id)s.%%(ext)s\" This just tells youtube-dl where I want the file and that I want it in an mkv container. It's pretty self explanatory, but I basically want a folder structure of \"[CHANNEL NAME]/[PLAYLIST NAME]/[PLAYLIST INDEX] - [VIDEO TITLE] - [YOUTUBE VIDEO ID].[EXTENSION]\". Feel free to customize this however you see fit. Please note that I used double % in some of these due to my script being a batch file ran on a windows VM. Things I want to do: - Create a docker container that runs the script. While the Windows VM is working perfect for this, it's the only thing the VM does now (used to be used for much more, but that has all been offloaded). It should be pretty easy since I leave the executables and the script all in a network share as is, so all it would need is the dependencies (which I think is only python if I'm not mistaken) and to set up a cron job. - Simplify the script a bit by using the -a argument. This would allow me to set up a file with the links I want to download. This would allow me to group a bunch of commands that all have the same arguments into 1 command. - Write a script that will move videos that were downloaded before they were put into playlists into their respective playlists once the uploader adds them. Right now what I do is download all of the uploader's playlists, then download all of their videos (using the same archive file so it doesn't re-download any). This means if the uploader is slow to add the video to a playlist, it will just be downloaded to a \"No Playlist\" folder. The other way I could do this would be to find a way to deduplicate all of the videos in the \"No Playlist\" folder and just use separate archive files for the playlist and non playlist videos, which might download some videos twice, but then later deduplicated. Final Thoughts: Youtube-dl is a wonderful and powerful tool, and with all of the crap going down on YouTube, you can never be too sure what videos you love might be taken down. Just what I've managed to download has already helped me and some of my friends out. It definitely is worth your time to automate downloading videos from channels you enjoy, and with a little know-how and experimentation, it doesn't take much time or effort to get something to a point where you can set it and forget it. Anyway, that was certainly longer than I thought it would be, but I really hope it helps some of you guys out. I've gained so much knowledge from this subreddit and it would mean a lot if I gave back and helped one of you out in return. Happy Hoarding! Just a quick edit: Be sure to check out the comments for some excellent ideas and more information on some things! As always, take this information and adapt it to your use case. Maybe my configuration will work perfectly for you, but more than likely you will have to tweak it a bit to get it just right for you. If you have any questions, please ask! Another quick edit: Some of the comments have brought up the fact that us as viewers of YouTube content, and even youtube-dl itself don't have any way to watch or download the original quality of the material as YouTube will automatically transcode videos when they are uploaded. This can be a problem for people who are trying to preserve things in the best quality they possibly can. If you are one of these people, you might want to try looking elsewhere for better quality releases of the content. The one example that immediately comes to mind for me is content from Rooster Teeth. The quality when downloaded directly from their website seems to be better quality than what you can pull from YouTube. For me personally, I will download some movies, and TV Shows and also most music and images in the best possible quality I can find, but when it comes to YouTube content, I just don't care as much and find the convenience of ripping directly from YouTube hard to beat. I also think the content tends to look great, especially for the file sizes, but this is obviously all up to you to decide."},

Some stores still have real M Discs in stock, but the majority of them (at least in Germany) now sell the new, fake kind, as I've ordered M Discs from various stores over the past few weeks and 90% of the time received the new fake kind which I returned. It probably also depends on region, I have no idea about discs in the US or other countries. Check the IDs of your discs people.

The NOAA Seamless Raster Navigational Chart Services will be shut down on January 1, 2022. This is part of a larger NOAA program to end production and maintenance of all NOAA traditional paper and raster nautical charts that was announced in the Federal Register in November 2019. Cancellation of traditional NOAA paper nautical charts and associated raster nautical chart products, such as BookletCharts™ and Raster Navigational Charts (RNC) will occur over the next four years and be completed by January 2025. More information about this overarching program to “sunset” traditional  nautical chart products is available on the “ Farewell to Traditional Nautical Charts ” web page. -- source Why help with this project?

I find this absolutely insane as people burn hundreds of these discs a day, trusting them to reliably hold precious data, yet most people aren't aware they're not burning a real M Disc, but just a garden variety BD-R that has none of the M Disc advantages that you pay for. So far the only mention of this that I've found online is a German thread from August where somebody received these same VERBAT-IMe-000 discs as me and thinks they're fake, not aware that Verbatim themselves are behind these discs. Some stores still have real M Discs in stock, but the majority of them (at least in Germany) now sell the new, fake kind, as I've ordered M Discs from various stores over the past few weeks and 90% of the time received the new fake kind which I returned. It probably also depends on region, I have no idea about discs in the US or other countries. Check the IDs of your discs people. Quick check: A real M Disc has a copper/gold tint on the back, the new fake ones are silver A real M Disc (25GB) has the MID/DISC ID: MILLEN-MR1-000, no matter what brand A real M Disc only burns in a drive with M Disc support"},

{"Title": "Live sync of data drive over the internet or simple backup. Lsyncd, DRDB or Kopia backup", "Author": "u/1000Zebras", "Content": "Hi, I'm curious what you guys would implement in this situation in order to, above all, simply maintain at the very least one solid, off-site backup of all of my data files and also, in the event of something happening to my main data drive on-site, reduce downtime as much as possible. Here is my current setup as is relevant to the question at hand: OrangePi 5 Plus running dietpi (so pretty much just debian) as my main server on-site One eMMC boot drive on the OrangePi containing the OS and all of my docker-compose files, as well as the OS itself Recently acquired 14TB external USB drive that houses purely my data for all of my docker containers (and then some outside of those, as well, but not much) OrangePi is running Tailscale A second RPi that lives at my brother's house also running Tailscale (so any connection between the two will more than likely be running over the interwebs, but through Tailscale) and with a second 14tb drive identical to the other connected to it, ready for data storage What I'm wondering is what may be the best strategy for maintaining a backup of the main data drive on the secondary drive, ideally in a mirrored fashion such that were the main drive to fail, I'd simply be able to plug in the secondary drive to the OrangePi, mount it at the same mountpoint as primary would have been, and I'd be back up and running nearly immediately (once the drive was physically moved between locations, of course). It's worth noting that, at present, I am dealing with nearly 4.5TB of data on main data drive (also currently backed up to the cloud via Kopia and iDrive E2) I've been considering: Trying out lsyncd or DRDB in order to literally have the drives mirror each other in as near realtime as the connection will allow. I have not used either of these tools yet, however, so I'm not familiar with exactly how they work behind the scene. And also, I realize that it is a lot of data to keep in sync over an internet connection, especially at file or block-level granularity as I believe those tools are designed for. In \"normal\" usage, I am not necessarily adding or changing all that much data on a day to day basis, but were I to make any major shifts in organization, or simply to add a lot more data into the mix suddenly, I'm wondering if the tools would be able to keep up Running an rsync job over ssh at a specified interval (say, maybe, a couple of times a day) in order to keep the two up date. I would of course again run into the same problem that would arise with the first option were I to make any drastic changes, but theoretically I'd eventually always have a 1 to 1 sync/backup between the two drives Simply running some sort of backup program from the main Orangepi data drive to the RPi's data drive, again at whatever specified interval (say, maybe, daily). I'd probably have to run some sort of webDAV server on the secondary RPi in order to facilitate backups between the two were I to use Kopia. Or, I suppose I could even run the data drive on RPi on a minio instance and have Kopia backup via the S3 protocol, but this seems perhaps like a little bit of overkill, and it wouldn't necessarily be the sort of 1 to 1 sync I'm shooting for as Kopia would organize the backup data in a fashion that it understands. This would be acceptable, though, as again at the end of the day the most important thing is to have all of the data itself stored safely in both locations, one way or another. How would you guys go about keeping things in sync between the two data drives? Or, should I just eschew that idea given the limitations of the bandwidth/connection between the two and go for straight backups using Kopia, or some othe rbackup system? Please, if you have any thoughts on how you'd architect this scenario, I'd very much appreciate any and perspectives/insights. Hopefully that all makes sense. If you need anything clarified, by all means speak up and I'll do my best to address. Thank you so very much for your time, expertise, and patience with my rambling question.

Occasionally they will happen and this just ensures things keep moving along as intended. Don't worry, the next time it is ran any videos that didn't fully download will most likely be picked right back up where it left off! --add-metadata --all-subs --embed-subs --embed-thumbnail These just embed metadata into the video once it's done downloading. You never know when this will come in handy, and having it all right in the video's container is nice. Just a little note, at the time of writing this post, ffmpeg can't embed images into a mkv, but the image is still downloaded and stored in the same location and with the same name as the video. --match-filter \"playlist_title != 'Liked videos' & playlist_title != 'Favorites'\" This will filter videos out that you don't want to download. Here is just a basic example of filtering out playlists with the title \"Liked Videos\" and \"Favorites\". I find this especially useful for filtering out playlists that contain a bunch of videos from other playlists. For example, if I'm downloading videos from a gaming channel and they have a playlist for \"Gmod\" and one for \"Minecraft PC\", but they also have one called \"PC Games\" that contains the contents of both the Gmod and the Minecraft playlists, I sometimes will want to keep those separate, so I will filter out the \"PC Games\" playlist. If there are videos in that playlist you still want, you can always add another youtube-dl command to your script with that playlist specifically. Depending on the channel, this can get rather annoying to manage, but its a good way to keep things better organized. -f \"(bestvideo[vcodec^=av01][height>=1080][fps>30]/bestvideo[vcodec=vp9.2][height>=1080] [fps>30]/bestvideo[vcodec=vp9][height>=1080][fps>30]/bestvideo[vcodec^=av01] [height>=1080]/bestvideo[vcodec=vp9.2][height>=1080]/bestvideo[vcodec=vp9] [height>=1080]/bestvideo[height>=1080]/bestvideo[vcodec^=av01][height>=720] [fps>30]/bestvideo[vcodec=vp9.2][height>=720][fps>30]/bestvideo[vcodec=vp9][height>=720] [fps>30]/bestvideo[vcodec^=av01][height>=720]/bestvideo[vcodec=vp9.2][height>=720]/ bestvideo[vcodec=vp9][height>=720]/bestvideo[height>=720]/bestvideo)+ (bestaudio[acodec=opus]/bestaudio)/best\" Ok. This is where things get a little tricky. I first want to start off by saying that this isn't totally necessary as all the -f command does is allows you to set preferences on what video and audio streams you want to download. If you want a basic rundown on how this works, the youtube-dl readme explains it better than I ever could. For my case here, I want to download video streams in certain codecs, which have a hierarchy of [av1>vp9.2>vp9>whatever is available]. It will keep going down the list until one is found that meets my criteria. You can also see that I prefer videos in 1080 with more than 30 fps, then 1080 30 fps, and that repeats for 720. I also prefer to get audio in opus if it's available. Just a side note for anyone wondering what vp9.2 is, it is the vp9 codec with HDR. Why bother with all of that nonsense when youtube-dl will automatically pick the best streams for you? Well, the way youtube-dl picks the best stream is based solely on bitrate. This means that for video it will usually chose the avc1 codec, which is pretty old at this point, and while it still looks good, I've found that the other codecs offer a smaller file size and similar or better quality. You may find otherwise and want to do things differently, but for me, this is how I do it as it saves hard drive space and I find the quality good. Also, as you will notice, I don't have any resolutions higher than 1080 on there. The way I have it, it should catch those higher res streams, but as of now, I don't archive many youtubers' videos that upload in higher res so I haven't found the need, but some day I'm sure I will change it. I already know your asking yourself, \"If this will catch the higher resolution streams, why don't you just leave the 720 options in there and remove the 1080?\". Well, it's because I've noticed that youtube has started to transcode many videos to the newer av1 codec, but so far most videos that I've seen only go up to 720 for the av1 codec. This means that if that stream is available, but there isn't a 1080p av1 stream, then it will always download those videos in 720p even if a higher res stream is available. --merge-output-format mkv -o \"%cd%/%%(playlist_uploader)s/%%(playlist)s/%%(playlist_index)s - %%(title)s - %%(id)s.%%(ext)s\" This just tells youtube-dl where I want the file and that I want it in an mkv container. It's pretty self explanatory, but I basically want a folder structure of \"[CHANNEL NAME]/[PLAYLIST NAME]/[PLAYLIST INDEX] - [VIDEO TITLE] - [YOUTUBE VIDEO ID].[EXTENSION]\". Feel free to customize this however you see fit. Please note that I used double % in some of these due to my script being a batch file ran on a windows VM. Things I want to do: - Create a docker container that runs the script. While the Windows VM is working perfect for this, it's the only thing the VM does now (used to be used for much more, but that has all been offloaded). It should be pretty easy since I leave the executables and the script all in a network share as is, so all it would need is the dependencies (which I think is only python if I'm not mistaken) and to set up a cron job. - Simplify the script a bit by using the -a argument. This would allow me to set up a file with the links I want to download. This would allow me to group a bunch of commands that all have the same arguments into 1 command. - Write a script that will move videos that were downloaded before they were put into playlists into their respective playlists once the uploader adds them. Right now what I do is download all of the uploader's playlists, then download all of their videos (using the same archive file so it doesn't re-download any). This means if the uploader is slow to add the video to a playlist, it will just be downloaded to a \"No Playlist\" folder. The other way I could do this would be to find a way to deduplicate all of the videos in the \"No Playlist\" folder and just use separate archive files for the playlist and non playlist videos, which might download some videos twice, but then later deduplicated. Final Thoughts: Youtube-dl is a wonderful and powerful tool, and with all of the crap going down on YouTube, you can never be too sure what videos you love might be taken down. Just what I've managed to download has already helped me and some of my friends out. It definitely is worth your time to automate downloading videos from channels you enjoy, and with a little know-how and experimentation, it doesn't take much time or effort to get something to a point where you can set it and forget it. Anyway, that was certainly longer than I thought it would be, but I really hope it helps some of you guys out. I've gained so much knowledge from this subreddit and it would mean a lot if I gave back and helped one of you out in return. Happy Hoarding! Just a quick edit: Be sure to check out the comments for some excellent ideas and more information on some things! As always, take this information and adapt it to your use case. Maybe my configuration will work perfectly for you, but more than likely you will have to tweak it a bit to get it just right for you. If you have any questions, please ask! Another quick edit: Some of the comments have brought up the fact that us as viewers of YouTube content, and even youtube-dl itself don't have any way to watch or download the original quality of the material as YouTube will automatically transcode videos when they are uploaded. This can be a problem for people who are trying to preserve things in the best quality they possibly can. If you are one of these people, you might want to try looking elsewhere for better quality releases of the content. The one example that immediately comes to mind for me is content from Rooster Teeth. The quality when downloaded directly from their website seems to be better quality than what you can pull from YouTube. For me personally, I will download some movies, and TV Shows and also most music and images in the best possible quality I can find, but when it comes to YouTube content, I just don't care as much and find the convenience of ripping directly from YouTube hard to beat. I also think the content tends to look great, especially for the file sizes, but this is obviously all up to you to decide."},

I first want to start off by saying that this isn't totally necessary as all the -f command does is allows you to set preferences on what video and audio streams you want to download. If you want a basic rundown on how this works, the youtube-dl readme explains it better than I ever could. For my case here, I want to download video streams in certain codecs, which have a hierarchy of [av1>vp9.2>vp9>whatever is available]. It will keep going down the list until one is found that meets my criteria. You can also see that I prefer videos in 1080 with more than 30 fps, then 1080 30 fps, and that repeats for 720. I also prefer to get audio in opus if it's available. Just a side note for anyone wondering what vp9.2 is, it is the vp9 codec with HDR. Why bother with all of that nonsense when youtube-dl will automatically pick the best streams for you? Well, the way youtube-dl picks the best stream is based solely on bitrate. This means that for video it will usually chose the avc1 codec, which is pretty old at this point, and while it still looks good, I've found that the other codecs offer a smaller file size and similar or better quality. You may find otherwise and want to do things differently, but for me, this is how I do it as it saves hard drive space and I find the quality good. Also, as you will notice, I don't have any resolutions higher than 1080 on there. The way I have it, it should catch those higher res streams, but as of now, I don't archive many youtubers' videos that upload in higher res so I haven't found the need, but some day I'm sure I will change it. I already know your asking yourself, \"If this will catch the higher resolution streams, why don't you just leave the 720 options in there and remove the 1080?\". Well, it's because I've noticed that youtube has started to transcode many videos to the newer av1 codec, but so far most videos that I've seen only go up to 720 for the av1 codec. This means that if that stream is available, but there isn't a 1080p av1 stream, then it will always download those videos in 720p even if a higher res stream is available. --merge-output-format mkv -o \"%cd%/%%(playlist_uploader)s/%%(playlist)s/%%(playlist_index)s - %%(title)s - %%(id)s.%%(ext)s\" This just tells youtube-dl where I want the file and that I want it in an mkv container. It's pretty self explanatory, but I basically want a folder structure of \"[CHANNEL NAME]/[PLAYLIST NAME]/[PLAYLIST INDEX] - [VIDEO TITLE] - [YOUTUBE VIDEO ID].[EXTENSION]\". Feel free to customize this however you see fit. Please note that I used double % in some of these due to my script being a batch file ran on a windows VM. Things I want to do: - Create a docker container that runs the script. While the Windows VM is working perfect for this, it's the only thing the VM does now (used to be used for much more, but that has all been offloaded). It should be pretty easy since I leave the executables and the script all in a network share as is, so all it would need is the dependencies (which I think is only python if I'm not mistaken) and to set up a cron job. - Simplify the script a bit by using the -a argument. This would allow me to set up a file with the links I want to download. This would allow me to group a bunch of commands that all have the same arguments into 1 command. - Write a script that will move videos that were downloaded before they were put into playlists into their respective playlists once the uploader adds them. Right now what I do is download all of the uploader's playlists, then download all of their videos (using the same archive file so it doesn't re-download any). This means if the uploader is slow to add the video to a playlist, it will just be downloaded to a \"No Playlist\" folder. The other way I could do this would be to find a way to deduplicate all of the videos in the \"No Playlist\" folder and just use separate archive files for the playlist and non playlist videos, which might download some videos twice, but then later deduplicated. Final Thoughts: Youtube-dl is a wonderful and powerful tool, and with all of the crap going down on YouTube, you can never be too sure what videos you love might be taken down. Just what I've managed to download has already helped me and some of my friends out. It definitely is worth your time to automate downloading videos from channels you enjoy, and with a little know-how and experimentation, it doesn't take much time or effort to get something to a point where you can set it and forget it. Anyway, that was certainly longer than I thought it would be, but I really hope it helps some of you guys out. I've gained so much knowledge from this subreddit and it would mean a lot if I gave back and helped one of you out in return. Happy Hoarding! Just a quick edit: Be sure to check out the comments for some excellent ideas and more information on some things! As always, take this information and adapt it to your use case. Maybe my configuration will work perfectly for you, but more than likely you will have to tweak it a bit to get it just right for you. If you have any questions, please ask! Another quick edit: Some of the comments have brought up the fact that us as viewers of YouTube content, and even youtube-dl itself don't have any way to watch or download the original quality of the material as YouTube will automatically transcode videos when they are uploaded. This can be a problem for people who are trying to preserve things in the best quality they possibly can. If you are one of these people, you might want to try looking elsewhere for better quality releases of the content. The one example that immediately comes to mind for me is content from Rooster Teeth. The quality when downloaded directly from their website seems to be better quality than what you can pull from YouTube. For me personally, I will download some movies, and TV Shows and also most music and images in the best possible quality I can find, but when it comes to YouTube content, I just don't care as much and find the convenience of ripping directly from YouTube hard to beat. I also think the content tends to look great, especially for the file sizes, but this is obviously all up to you to decide."},

So what is the RNC? NOAA's RNC Tile Service (WMTS) The NOAA RNC Tile Service provides standardized nautical chart tilesets for the public, eliminating the need for application developers to regularly undergo the cumbersome process of transforming NOAA BSB files into tilesets.

The NOAA Seamless Raster Navigational Chart Services will be shut down on January 1, 2022. This is part of a larger NOAA program to end production and maintenance of all NOAA traditional paper and raster nautical charts that was announced in the Federal Register in November 2019. Cancellation of traditional NOAA paper nautical charts and associated raster nautical chart products, such as BookletCharts™ and Raster Navigational Charts (RNC) will occur over the next four years and be completed by January 2025. More information about this overarching program to “sunset” traditional  nautical chart products is available on the “ Farewell to Traditional Nautical Charts ” web page. -- source Why help with this project?

{"Title": "PSA: Verbatim no longer sells real M Discs, now puts regular BD-Rs in M Disc packaging", "Author": "u/JazzKazz", "Content": "TLDR: instead of selling real M Discs, Verbatim now puts their cheap organic BD-Rs into M Disc cases and charges M Disc prices for them In July, I bought 25GB Verbatim M Discs from Amazon. Even though I bought them directly from Amazon Europe, the discs I received were not real M Discs but regular Verbatim BD-Rs with an organic layer that were made to look like M Discs. I noticed right away because the MID of the discs was VERBAT-IMe-000 , which is the code for their regular BD-Rs, instead of MILLEN-MR1-000 which is the MID that all 25GB M Discs have. At this point I assumed I'd been sold fakes, but 3 months later I again ordered Verbatim M Discs, this time from German retail chain Saturn, and once again received these discs that I assumed are fakes. I emailed Verbatim's customer service and prepared a bunch of images that show these fake M Discs next to real ones. But to my surprise, after a debate with customer service they told me that these are not fakes, and that these \"are the only M Discs that are going to be sold from now on\" (quote). What's insane is that these discs currently being sold are not M Discs at all, but regular organic layer Verbatim BD-Rs, yet Verbatim still calls these M Disc. When I tried calling them out on their lies by pointing out things such as the discs' MID being the same as that of regular BD-Rs and the discs having 6x burn speed despite real M Discs being 4x speed, they just chucked it up to \"the discs being completely reworked, and we moved production facility hence the new DISC IDs\". The most ridiculous part is, these \"new M Discs\" (as Verbatim support calls them) are writable in any standard Blu Ray drive, you don't even need a drive that supports M Disc burning! For those unaware, M Discs require an M Disc capable drive to be burned, because M Discs need a stronger laser than what is used for regular BDs.

Would anyone know of a file copying software that can handle a source/destination like a NAS with multiple 1gb network interfaces. Maybe its best if I describe the effect I am looking for. Start a copy job, reach the avg-peak of 100MB/s and then the software becomes aware of this and then continues to enumerate folders as subtasks and starts these folders on the other IP addresses available from the NAS. So, if the NAS had 2 gb/s NICs, both would be saturated at 100MB/s, rather than only one granting higher thorough-put. Thank you for reading."},

{"Title": "PSA: Verbatim no longer sells real M Discs, now puts regular BD-Rs in M Disc packaging", "Author": "u/JazzKazz", "Content": "TLDR: instead of selling real M Discs, Verbatim now puts their cheap organic BD-Rs into M Disc cases and charges M Disc prices for them In July, I bought 25GB Verbatim M Discs from Amazon. Even though I bought them directly from Amazon Europe, the discs I received were not real M Discs but regular Verbatim BD-Rs with an organic layer that were made to look like M Discs. I noticed right away because the MID of the discs was VERBAT-IMe-000 , which is the code for their regular BD-Rs, instead of MILLEN-MR1-000 which is the MID that all 25GB M Discs have. At this point I assumed I'd been sold fakes, but 3 months later I again ordered Verbatim M Discs, this time from German retail chain Saturn, and once again received these discs that I assumed are fakes. I emailed Verbatim's customer service and prepared a bunch of images that show these fake M Discs next to real ones. But to my surprise, after a debate with customer service they told me that these are not fakes, and that these \"are the only M Discs that are going to be sold from now on\" (quote). What's insane is that these discs currently being sold are not M Discs at all, but regular organic layer Verbatim BD-Rs, yet Verbatim still calls these M Disc. When I tried calling them out on their lies by pointing out things such as the discs' MID being the same as that of regular BD-Rs and the discs having 6x burn speed despite real M Discs being 4x speed, they just chucked it up to \"the discs being completely reworked, and we moved production facility hence the new DISC IDs\". The most ridiculous part is, these \"new M Discs\" (as Verbatim support calls them) are writable in any standard Blu Ray drive, you don't even need a drive that supports M Disc burning! For those unaware, M Discs require an M Disc capable drive to be burned, because M Discs need a stronger laser than what is used for regular BDs. This stronger laser is only in M Disc drives and there is no way you could ever write a real M Disc in a non M Disc drive.

I've been putting everything on hard drives, then after filling them up, moving everything to larger drive. The last drive I've used was some Western Digital Blue 8TB drive, and last week it filled up, so I purchased a new 20TB drive and was about to copy everything into it, but before I could do that, the WD drive failed. I've used few file restoration programs, and managed to salvage about 80% of everything that was on the drive, but the problem is, like 70% of what I've restored is either corrupted, or doesn't have audio. And all the files were put into ~75 different folders, with around 900 or so files each. I'd like to sort out the files with audio and without, in order to save the good ones and get rid of the bad ones. All files were renamed to random letters and numbers by recovery software, so the corrupted and muted files are basically completely useless to me, since I can't even use the file names to find out what files those are. All the files are either .mp4, .mkv, .avi, .mov or .wmv. Sorting through tens of thousands of files would take me months, and I just don't have the time or patience to do that. I've had the idea of importing files into video editing soft like Premiere and look at the generated waveform to find out good files,  but there's quite a lot of files with codecs unsupported by Premiere, like VP09 and such, so vast majority of files, even with audio present show up as flat lines on Premiere waveform, thus this method is completely useless to me. Like, importing a folder of restored files only generates maybe 20-30 waveforms, the rest are flat lines, and so manual sorting is still required. Anyone know of any software that can scan thousands of files and either mark or separate them by presence of audio, or have some other solution?"},

I recently switched over from my HP Omen laptop to a new MacBook Pro. Not knowing about the data formatting situation, I backed up all my data from my old laptop onto my Seagate Expansion Portable Drive 2TB. When using my MacBook, I noticed I couldn't upload files to this harddrive because the file formatting was different. I found on the internet that to switch the external harddrive from NTFS to APFS I can use Disk Utility to reformat the device. For this to happen however i have to backup the files that I have on my external harddrive, because to reformat it the harddrive has to be erased. The thing is, if i back-up the files to my old HP Omen, I can't reupload the files back to my external hard drive because it has been reformatted to APFS, and the files are NTFS. I also can't back-up the files to my new MacBook, because the size of my files is way to big for the internal storage of my Macbook! Is the only option for this really just to buy another external harddrive coded to APFS, or keep my files on my hard drive on my old dusty laptop that barely functions? This feels like a catch-22 situation to me. Sorry if this question has a) been answered already or b) is not relevant to this subreddit. Any help is appreciated!"},

So zpool attach mnt to mntbackup. Sounds like this automatically starts mirroring. I know this isn't ideal without being an off-site backup but I'm not the most literate at actually managing this and want something easy. Would I be able to just plug in backup, then unplug the backup pool and cold storage? I don't need perfect redundancy.

{"Title": "Let's Say You Wanted to Back Up The Internet Archive", "Author": "u/textfiles", "Content": "So, you think you want to back up the Internet Archive. This is a gargantuan project and not something to be taken lightly. Definitely consider why you think you need to do this, and what exactly you hope to have at the end. There's thousands of subcollections at the Archive and maybe you actually want a smaller set of it. These instructions work for those smaller sets and you'll get it much faster. Or you're just curious as to what it would take to get everything . Well, first, bear in mind there's different classes of material in the Archive's 50+ petabytes of data storage. There's material that can be downloaded, material that can only be viewed/streamed, and material that is used internally like the wayback machine or database storage. We'll set aside the 20+ petabytes of material under the wayback for the purpose of this discussion other than you can get websites by directly downloading and mirroring as you would any web page. That leaves the many collections and items you can reach directly. They tend to be in the form of https://archive.org/details/identifier where identifier is the \"item identifier\", more like a directory scattered among dozens and dozens of racks that hold the items. By default, these are completely open to downloads, unless they're set to be a variety of \"stream/sample\" settings, at which point, for the sake of this tutorial, can't be downloaded at all - just viewed. To see the directory version of an item, switch details to download , like archive.org/download/identifier - this will show you all the files residing for an item, both Original, System, and Derived. Let's talk about those three. Original files are what were uploaded into the identifier by the user or script. They are never modifier or touched by the system. Unless something goes wrong, what you download of an original file is exactly what was uploaded. Derived files are then created by the scripts and handlers within the archive to make them easier to interact with. For example, PDF files are \"derived\" into EPUBs, jpeg-sets, OCR'd textfiles, and so on. System files are created by the processes of the Archive's scripts to either keep track of metadata, of information about the item, and so on. They are generally *.xml files, or thumbnails, or so on. In general, you only want the Original files as well as the metadata (from the *.xml files) to have the \"core\" of an item. This will save you a lot of disk space - the derived files can always be recreated later. So Anyway The best of the ways to download from Internet Archive is using the official client. I wrote an introduction to the IA client here: http://blog.archive.org/2019/06/05/the-ia-client-the-swiss-army-knife-of-internet-archive/ The direct link to the IA client is here: https://github.com/jjjake/internetarchive So, an initial experiment would be to download the entirety of a specific collection. To get a collection's items, do ia search collection:collection-name --itemlist Then, use ia download to download each individual item. You can do this with a script, and even do it in parallel. There's also the --retries command, in case systems hit load or other issues arise. (I advise checking the documentation and reading thoroughly - perhaps people can reply with recipes of what they have found. There are over 63,000,000 individual items at the Archive. Choose wisely.

{"Title": "Let's Say You Wanted to Back Up The Internet Archive", "Author": "u/textfiles", "Content": "So, you think you want to back up the Internet Archive. This is a gargantuan project and not something to be taken lightly. Definitely consider why you think you need to do this, and what exactly you hope to have at the end. There's thousands of subcollections at the Archive and maybe you actually want a smaller set of it. These instructions work for those smaller sets and you'll get it much faster. Or you're just curious as to what it would take to get everything . Well, first, bear in mind there's different classes of material in the Archive's 50+ petabytes of data storage. There's material that can be downloaded, material that can only be viewed/streamed, and material that is used internally like the wayback machine or database storage. We'll set aside the 20+ petabytes of material under the wayback for the purpose of this discussion other than you can get websites by directly downloading and mirroring as you would any web page. That leaves the many collections and items you can reach directly. They tend to be in the form of https://archive.org/details/identifier where identifier is the \"item identifier\", more like a directory scattered among dozens and dozens of racks that hold the items. By default, these are completely open to downloads, unless they're set to be a variety of \"stream/sample\" settings, at which point, for the sake of this tutorial, can't be downloaded at all - just viewed. To see the directory version of an item, switch details to download , like archive.org/download/identifier - this will show you all the files residing for an item, both Original, System, and Derived. Let's talk about those three. Original files are what were uploaded into the identifier by the user or script. They are never modifier or touched by the system. Unless something goes wrong, what you download of an original file is exactly what was uploaded. Derived files are then created by the scripts and handlers within the archive to make them easier to interact with. For example, PDF files are \"derived\" into EPUBs, jpeg-sets, OCR'd textfiles, and so on. System files are created by the processes of the Archive's scripts to either keep track of metadata, of information about the item, and so on. They are generally *.xml files, or thumbnails, or so on. In general, you only want the Original files as well as the metadata (from the *.xml files) to have the \"core\" of an item. This will save you a lot of disk space - the derived files can always be recreated later. So Anyway The best of the ways to download from Internet Archive is using the official client. I wrote an introduction to the IA client here: http://blog.archive.org/2019/06/05/the-ia-client-the-swiss-army-knife-of-internet-archive/ The direct link to the IA client is here: https://github.com/jjjake/internetarchive So, an initial experiment would be to download the entirety of a specific collection. To get a collection's items, do ia search collection:collection-name --itemlist Then, use ia download to download each individual item. You can do this with a script, and even do it in parallel. There's also the --retries command, in case systems hit load or other issues arise. (I advise checking the documentation and reading thoroughly - perhaps people can reply with recipes of what they have found. There are over 63,000,000 individual items at the Archive. Choose wisely.

I've been putting everything on hard drives, then after filling them up, moving everything to larger drive. The last drive I've used was some Western Digital Blue 8TB drive, and last week it filled up, so I purchased a new 20TB drive and was about to copy everything into it, but before I could do that, the WD drive failed. I've used few file restoration programs, and managed to salvage about 80% of everything that was on the drive, but the problem is, like 70% of what I've restored is either corrupted, or doesn't have audio. And all the files were put into ~75 different folders, with around 900 or so files each. I'd like to sort out the files with audio and without, in order to save the good ones and get rid of the bad ones. All files were renamed to random letters and numbers by recovery software, so the corrupted and muted files are basically completely useless to me, since I can't even use the file names to find out what files those are. All the files are either .mp4, .mkv, .avi, .mov or .wmv. Sorting through tens of thousands of files would take me months, and I just don't have the time or patience to do that. I've had the idea of importing files into video editing soft like Premiere and look at the generated waveform to find out good files,  but there's quite a lot of files with codecs unsupported by Premiere, like VP09 and such, so vast majority of files, even with audio present show up as flat lines on Premiere waveform, thus this method is completely useless to me. Like, importing a folder of restored files only generates maybe 20-30 waveforms, the rest are flat lines, and so manual sorting is still required. Anyone know of any software that can scan thousands of files and either mark or separate them by presence of audio, or have some other solution?"},

I recently switched over from my HP Omen laptop to a new MacBook Pro. Not knowing about the data formatting situation, I backed up all my data from my old laptop onto my Seagate Expansion Portable Drive 2TB. When using my MacBook, I noticed I couldn't upload files to this harddrive because the file formatting was different. I found on the internet that to switch the external harddrive from NTFS to APFS I can use Disk Utility to reformat the device. For this to happen however i have to backup the files that I have on my external harddrive, because to reformat it the harddrive has to be erased. The thing is, if i back-up the files to my old HP Omen, I can't reupload the files back to my external hard drive because it has been reformatted to APFS, and the files are NTFS. I also can't back-up the files to my new MacBook, because the size of my files is way to big for the internal storage of my Macbook! Is the only option for this really just to buy another external harddrive coded to APFS, or keep my files on my hard drive on my old dusty laptop that barely functions? This feels like a catch-22 situation to me. Sorry if this question has a) been answered already or b) is not relevant to this subreddit. Any help is appreciated!"},

My plan is to destroy a zpool of the truenas made of 4x10tb raidz1 and move that pool into the primary server (add a pcie with more sata ports) then use zpool attach to mirror my current 4x8tb raidz1 (mnt) to the newly recreated zpool of the 4x10tb from the old truenas server (named mntbackup). So zpool attach mnt to mntbackup. Sounds like this automatically starts mirroring. I know this isn't ideal without being an off-site backup but I'm not the most literate at actually managing this and want something easy. Would I be able to just plug in backup, then unplug the backup pool and cold storage? I don't need perfect redundancy.

{"Title": "Let's Say You Wanted to Back Up The Internet Archive", "Author": "u/textfiles", "Content": "So, you think you want to back up the Internet Archive. This is a gargantuan project and not something to be taken lightly. Definitely consider why you think you need to do this, and what exactly you hope to have at the end. There's thousands of subcollections at the Archive and maybe you actually want a smaller set of it. These instructions work for those smaller sets and you'll get it much faster. Or you're just curious as to what it would take to get everything . Well, first, bear in mind there's different classes of material in the Archive's 50+ petabytes of data storage. There's material that can be downloaded, material that can only be viewed/streamed, and material that is used internally like the wayback machine or database storage. We'll set aside the 20+ petabytes of material under the wayback for the purpose of this discussion other than you can get websites by directly downloading and mirroring as you would any web page. That leaves the many collections and items you can reach directly. They tend to be in the form of https://archive.org/details/identifier where identifier is the \"item identifier\", more like a directory scattered among dozens and dozens of racks that hold the items. By default, these are completely open to downloads, unless they're set to be a variety of \"stream/sample\" settings, at which point, for the sake of this tutorial, can't be downloaded at all - just viewed. To see the directory version of an item, switch details to download , like archive.org/download/identifier - this will show you all the files residing for an item, both Original, System, and Derived. Let's talk about those three. Original files are what were uploaded into the identifier by the user or script. They are never modifier or touched by the system. Unless something goes wrong, what you download of an original file is exactly what was uploaded. Derived files are then created by the scripts and handlers within the archive to make them easier to interact with. For example, PDF files are \"derived\" into EPUBs, jpeg-sets, OCR'd textfiles, and so on. System files are created by the processes of the Archive's scripts to either keep track of metadata, of information about the item, and so on. They are generally *.xml files, or thumbnails, or so on. In general, you only want the Original files as well as the metadata (from the *.xml files) to have the \"core\" of an item. This will save you a lot of disk space - the derived files can always be recreated later. So Anyway The best of the ways to download from Internet Archive is using the official client. I wrote an introduction to the IA client here: http://blog.archive.org/2019/06/05/the-ia-client-the-swiss-army-knife-of-internet-archive/ The direct link to the IA client is here: https://github.com/jjjake/internetarchive So, an initial experiment would be to download the entirety of a specific collection. To get a collection's items, do ia search collection:collection-name --itemlist Then, use ia download to download each individual item. You can do this with a script, and even do it in parallel. There's also the --retries command, in case systems hit load or other issues arise. (I advise checking the documentation and reading thoroughly - perhaps people can reply with recipes of what they have found. There are over 63,000,000 individual items at the Archive. Choose wisely. And good luck. Edit, Next Day: As is often the case when the Internet Archive's collections are discussed in this way, people are proposing the usual solutions, which I call the Big Three: Organize an ad-hoc/professional/simple/complicated shared storage scheme Go to a [corporate entity] and get some sort of discount/free service/hardware Send Over a Bunch of Hard Drives and Make a Copy I appreciate people giving thought to these solutions and will respond to them (or make new stand-along messages) in the thread. In the meantime, I will say that the Archive has endorsed and worked with a concept called The Distributed Web which has both included discussions and meetings as well as proposed technologies - at the very least, it's interesting and along the lines that people think of when they think of \"sharing\" the load.

The outpour of support for the project still leaves me in total awe. Thousands of people around the world joined our seeding effort donating bandwidth, storage, and expertise. Today we announce that the final set of 1,000 books is now seeded, saved, and preserved. Stunning generosity and heart. But our volunteers couldn’t stop at books. We have already started to secure and preserve a new library of 80 million scientific articles. And now thanks to the brave librarians at Library Genesis and SciHub and all the volunteer seeders the collections can never be taken away from humanity. Why are Library Genesis and SciHub vital to humanity? Library Genesis and SciHub set out to share every scientific article and every scientific book with every single person on Earth. Their initiative fulfills United Nations/UNESCO world development goals that mandate the removal of restrictions on access to science. Big publishing companies just want “open access,” representing only about 28% of articles, and no books. They want the rest of humanity’s accumulated scientific knowledge to remain locked up behind paywalled databases and unaffordable textbooks. We said fuck that. Limiting and delaying humanity’s access to science isn’t a business, it’s a crime, one with an untold number of victims and preventable deaths. Doctors and scientists in the developing world already face unbelievable challenges in their jobs. Tearing down paywalls between them and the knowledge they need to fight for health and freedom in their homeland is the least we can do to help. How can I help? Reddit’s support has been huge. In December the project’s story was published in Vice, receiving 60,000 upvotes across r/technology , r/futurology , r/datahoarder , and r/seedboxes , and shared to readers around the world in international technology news. That’s just for seeding the torrents! Imagine the stories of knowledge brought to doctors and scientists and students around the world. They hold an incredible story to tell. We need their stories next, and we can bring the crisis of access to knowledge into view with our upvotes. Our seeding project has been an incredible success thanks to literal 24/7 work of our volunteers over the last month. Seedbox.io and their provider NFOrce.nl donated a dedicated high-speed server to seed the full Library Genesis book collection. The-Eye.eu is both seeding and archiving the entirety of both library collections. You’re also welcome to join The-Eye.eu’s discord to learn how you can help seed (discord.gg/the-eye #books). Programmers are needed to help re-envision the web frontend, search engine, or distribution model ( https://gitlab.com/libgen1 ). The entirety of Library Genesis is open-source, so anyone is welcome to reimagine the project. Here's what else our communities accomplished in technical details: Swarm peers increased from 3,000 seeders to 30,000 seeders! Swarm speeds increased from about 60KB/s on most torrents to over 100MB/s, thanks to the joint Seedbox.io and NFOrce.nl dedicated server and everyone else seeding. Refreshed and indexed 2,400 .torrent files, replacing 100+ dead trackers with new, live announce URLs The-Eye.eu began to prepare and hash-check the collection for archiving, more to come on that (TBA) Endless thanks to everyone at the-eye.eu , all the volunteers, Seedbox.io/NFOrce.nl, and UltraSeedbox for coming together to make this project happen. We brought science around the world with our torrenting, one of the many big steps in permanently unchaining and preserving all of this knowledge for humanity. https://preview.redd.it/coz7hvkh3s541.png Relevant Links https://phillm.net/libgen-seeds-needed.php https://phillm.net/libgen-stats-table.php \"Archivists Are Trying to Make Sure a ‘Pirate Bay of Science’ Never Goes Down\" by Matthew Gault in Vice News TorrentFreak's coverage by Andy /r/DataHoarder: Let's talk about datahoarding that's actually important: distributing knowledge and the role of Libgen in educating the developing world. /r/Seedboxes Charity Drive /r/Seedboxes Update"},

I've been putting everything on hard drives, then after filling them up, moving everything to larger drive. The last drive I've used was some Western Digital Blue 8TB drive, and last week it filled up, so I purchased a new 20TB drive and was about to copy everything into it, but before I could do that, the WD drive failed. I've used few file restoration programs, and managed to salvage about 80% of everything that was on the drive, but the problem is, like 70% of what I've restored is either corrupted, or doesn't have audio. And all the files were put into ~75 different folders, with around 900 or so files each. I'd like to sort out the files with audio and without, in order to save the good ones and get rid of the bad ones. All files were renamed to random letters and numbers by recovery software, so the corrupted and muted files are basically completely useless to me, since I can't even use the file names to find out what files those are. All the files are either .mp4, .mkv, .avi, .mov or .wmv. Sorting through tens of thousands of files would take me months, and I just don't have the time or patience to do that. I've had the idea of importing files into video editing soft like Premiere and look at the generated waveform to find out good files,  but there's quite a lot of files with codecs unsupported by Premiere, like VP09 and such, so vast majority of files, even with audio present show up as flat lines on Premiere waveform, thus this method is completely useless to me. Like, importing a folder of restored files only generates maybe 20-30 waveforms, the rest are flat lines, and so manual sorting is still required. Anyone know of any software that can scan thousands of files and either mark or separate them by presence of audio, or have some other solution?"},

I recently switched over from my HP Omen laptop to a new MacBook Pro. Not knowing about the data formatting situation, I backed up all my data from my old laptop onto my Seagate Expansion Portable Drive 2TB. When using my MacBook, I noticed I couldn't upload files to this harddrive because the file formatting was different. I found on the internet that to switch the external harddrive from NTFS to APFS I can use Disk Utility to reformat the device. For this to happen however i have to backup the files that I have on my external harddrive, because to reformat it the harddrive has to be erased. The thing is, if i back-up the files to my old HP Omen, I can't reupload the files back to my external hard drive because it has been reformatted to APFS, and the files are NTFS. I also can't back-up the files to my new MacBook, because the size of my files is way to big for the internal storage of my Macbook! Is the only option for this really just to buy another external harddrive coded to APFS, or keep my files on my hard drive on my old dusty laptop that barely functions? This feels like a catch-22 situation to me. Sorry if this question has a) been answered already or b) is not relevant to this subreddit. Any help is appreciated!"},

{"Title": "Library Genesis Project update: 2.5 million books seeded with the world, 80 million scientific articles next", "Author": "u/shrine", "Content": "For the latest updates on the Library Genesis Seeding Project join r/libgen and r/scihub Last month volunteers on r/seedboxes , r/datahoarder , across reddit, and around the world joined together to secure and preserve 2.5 million scientific books for humanity- for students, for doctors, for scientists, for future generations. The outpour of support for the project still leaves me in total awe. Thousands of people around the world joined our seeding effort donating bandwidth, storage, and expertise. Today we announce that the final set of 1,000 books is now seeded, saved, and preserved. Stunning generosity and heart. But our volunteers couldn’t stop at books. We have already started to secure and preserve a new library of 80 million scientific articles. And now thanks to the brave librarians at Library Genesis and SciHub and all the volunteer seeders the collections can never be taken away from humanity. Why are Library Genesis and SciHub vital to humanity? Library Genesis and SciHub set out to share every scientific article and every scientific book with every single person on Earth. Their initiative fulfills United Nations/UNESCO world development goals that mandate the removal of restrictions on access to science. Big publishing companies just want “open access,” representing only about 28% of articles, and no books. They want the rest of humanity’s accumulated scientific knowledge to remain locked up behind paywalled databases and unaffordable textbooks. We said fuck that. Limiting and delaying humanity’s access to science isn’t a business, it’s a crime, one with an untold number of victims and preventable deaths. Doctors and scientists in the developing world already face unbelievable challenges in their jobs. Tearing down paywalls between them and the knowledge they need to fight for health and freedom in their homeland is the least we can do to help. How can I help? Reddit’s support has been huge. In December the project’s story was published in Vice, receiving 60,000 upvotes across r/technology , r/futurology , r/datahoarder , and r/seedboxes , and shared to readers around the world in international technology news. That’s just for seeding the torrents! Imagine the stories of knowledge brought to doctors and scientists and students around the world. They hold an incredible story to tell. We need their stories next, and we can bring the crisis of access to knowledge into view with our upvotes. Our seeding project has been an incredible success thanks to literal 24/7 work of our volunteers over the last month. Seedbox.io and their provider NFOrce.nl donated a dedicated high-speed server to seed the full Library Genesis book collection. The-Eye.eu is both seeding and archiving the entirety of both library collections. You’re also welcome to join The-Eye.eu’s discord to learn how you can help seed (discord.gg/the-eye #books). Programmers are needed to help re-envision the web frontend, search engine, or distribution model ( https://gitlab.com/libgen1 ). The entirety of Library Genesis is open-source, so anyone is welcome to reimagine the project. Here's what else our communities accomplished in technical details: Swarm peers increased from 3,000 seeders to 30,000 seeders! Swarm speeds increased from about 60KB/s on most torrents to over 100MB/s, thanks to the joint Seedbox.io and NFOrce.nl dedicated server and everyone else seeding. Refreshed and indexed 2,400 .torrent files, replacing 100+ dead trackers with new, live announce URLs The-Eye.eu began to prepare and hash-check the collection for archiving, more to come on that (TBA) Endless thanks to everyone at the-eye.eu , all the volunteers, Seedbox.io/NFOrce.nl, and UltraSeedbox for coming together to make this project happen. We brought science around the world with our torrenting, one of the many big steps in permanently unchaining and preserving all of this knowledge for humanity. https://preview.redd.it/coz7hvkh3s541.png Relevant Links https://phillm.net/libgen-seeds-needed.php https://phillm.net/libgen-stats-table.php \"Archivists Are Trying to Make Sure a ‘Pirate Bay of Science’ Never Goes Down\" by Matthew Gault in Vice News TorrentFreak's coverage by Andy /r/DataHoarder: Let's talk about datahoarding that's actually important: distributing knowledge and the role of Libgen in educating the developing world. /r/Seedboxes Charity Drive /r/Seedboxes Update"},

My plan is to destroy a zpool of the truenas made of 4x10tb raidz1 and move that pool into the primary server (add a pcie with more sata ports) then use zpool attach to mirror my current 4x8tb raidz1 (mnt) to the newly recreated zpool of the 4x10tb from the old truenas server (named mntbackup). So zpool attach mnt to mntbackup. Sounds like this automatically starts mirroring. I know this isn't ideal without being an off-site backup but I'm not the most literate at actually managing this and want something easy. Would I be able to just plug in backup, then unplug the backup pool and cold storage? I don't need perfect redundancy. Would I be able to plug the mntbackup raidz1 back in sometime in the future and the missing new data automatically sync or would I need scripts of rysnc or zfs send receive to add new data?

For this reason there are some real issues with the loads on the electrical circuits between my network storage, gaming PC, HTPCs and so on.  Plus just 'physical space' and noise limitations. As such, when my 16 drive UnRAID server ran out of drive slots, the only solution was to build a second server which is in the Livingroom, in a 4U Rosewill case, sitting discretely in an Ikea Lack table with caster wheels.  The main server has a Ryzen 9 3950X and does all the dockers and stuff.  The secondary server has an Intel E5 2697v2 and sits there eating electricity for the sake of letting me run 12 more drives. But we're moving!  Three floors!  Gonna run ethernet in all the walls.  There will be a finished basement area for 'the gaming goodness' and I can finally set up network and storage in a real rack, on the unfinished side of the basement, with it's own 15amp circuit and where no one will care how much noise anything in there makes.  That means I an get disk shelf and make all of this way less stupid! The main plan is to retire the server inside the 4U rack case, then transplant the main tower server into that 4U rack case and expand it's drive capacity with a disk shelf.  So here's where I have questions: Firstly, things like the NetApp DS4246 and related seem to be what I'm looking at.  All my drives are SATA, to these disk shelves support SATA out of the box, is additional hardware required for SATA drives, or do I need to look for something alternate/specific? Secondly, these shelves offer up to four PSUs for redundancy, but how many are needed at minimum assuming 'up time' is not a major concern?  Also what kind of power consumption should I see beyond the drives it's powering?  I should def see an advantage over a whole 11 year old Xeon running, right? Thirdly, for the 'host server' to access this kind of disk shelf, I should only require something like an LSI 9201-16E and a quartet of 8088 to SFF-8088 cables, right?  From there on, the host device should just have an LSI controller which see's up to 24 drives on it, and it's all happy and 'just works'?"},

Literally \"copy this file over there when it exists\". I looked into FreeFileSync and Syncthing but these appear to sync directly to a server instead to a local folder. One additional thing I an looking for is two-way syncing. This way, I can make a \"universal\" document folders where all my computers will have the same content, and update them if they are missing anything. This could count as additional backup since I would have the same files over many computers. Does anyone have recommendations for a software solution?

Now I have some questions to help me transition/transfer/migration from my old external hdd setup to my NAS solution. My first question mainly revolves around keeping file integrity when transferring files. What programs are best at doing this? I've done some research and I've currently chosen TeraCopy. It looks pretty good; other posts have suggested stuff like Robocopy but I couldn't find/get it to work (maybe it's command line stuff that, though I admittedly didn't look too hard since I don't trust inbuilt windows stuff that much). How good is TeraCopy and its file integrity verification? My second question is about checking files for corruption, mainly videos. This one is a bit of a shot in the dark, a hail mary hope of mine that I can fix this headache inducing rookie mistake of mine. Long story short, I had to reinitialize my NAS due to changing its setup. When doing this, I copied data I had on the NAS to a ext HDD (no verification done, I now know it was a stupid rookie mistake) totaling approx 3.5 TB of data, mainly video files (probably around 1k hours). Now I found at least 1 of them has a bit of corruption, where about 20 seconds got messed up. Is there a way or program that can find these kind of problems with files? I'm guessing probably not, but if there are potential solutions I'd love to find them. Otherwise, I guess those errors/problems will just exist and years later I'll find out and lament that if I knew years ago I could have replaced those files but not when I do.

Stupid me. It was a full format, not a quick format, but I stopped it only a second or two after it had started. I ran testdisk to check the damages and try to recover the files; it didn't really work all too well. I tried to run photorec, but the software is unusable - my input was randomized and would constantly change if it even accepted input at all; this wasn't a mapping issue, as the right arrow key would act as arrow up, enter, arrow down, or any other random input at any given time. Either way, I eventually found and ran R-Studio's R-Linux, which seemed to work fine, if a little unintuitive. I ran the software and seemingly recovered a lot of files; among others, I recovered a lot of mp4 files. This was expected, as the drive was filled almost exclusively with videos. However, R-Linux does not have built in capabilities to recover webms or other video file formats like qt, and I know there were a great deal of those files on the drive. Does anyone know of any good ways to recover those files as well? I know R-Linux has the ability to add custom file types by building an xml file for that type. I wouldn't know where to begin on getting the information for such a file, but does anyone have one that would work for the not included video file types (webm, qt, etc.)? Or does anyone know of a software that has the ability to recover those files?"},

The outpour of support for the project still leaves me in total awe. Thousands of people around the world joined our seeding effort donating bandwidth, storage, and expertise. Today we announce that the final set of 1,000 books is now seeded, saved, and preserved. Stunning generosity and heart. But our volunteers couldn’t stop at books. We have already started to secure and preserve a new library of 80 million scientific articles. And now thanks to the brave librarians at Library Genesis and SciHub and all the volunteer seeders the collections can never be taken away from humanity. Why are Library Genesis and SciHub vital to humanity? Library Genesis and SciHub set out to share every scientific article and every scientific book with every single person on Earth. Their initiative fulfills United Nations/UNESCO world development goals that mandate the removal of restrictions on access to science. Big publishing companies just want “open access,” representing only about 28% of articles, and no books. They want the rest of humanity’s accumulated scientific knowledge to remain locked up behind paywalled databases and unaffordable textbooks. We said fuck that. Limiting and delaying humanity’s access to science isn’t a business, it’s a crime, one with an untold number of victims and preventable deaths. Doctors and scientists in the developing world already face unbelievable challenges in their jobs. Tearing down paywalls between them and the knowledge they need to fight for health and freedom in their homeland is the least we can do to help. How can I help? Reddit’s support has been huge. In December the project’s story was published in Vice, receiving 60,000 upvotes across r/technology , r/futurology , r/datahoarder , and r/seedboxes , and shared to readers around the world in international technology news. That’s just for seeding the torrents! Imagine the stories of knowledge brought to doctors and scientists and students around the world. They hold an incredible story to tell. We need their stories next, and we can bring the crisis of access to knowledge into view with our upvotes. Our seeding project has been an incredible success thanks to literal 24/7 work of our volunteers over the last month. Seedbox.io and their provider NFOrce.nl donated a dedicated high-speed server to seed the full Library Genesis book collection. The-Eye.eu is both seeding and archiving the entirety of both library collections. You’re also welcome to join The-Eye.eu’s discord to learn how you can help seed (discord.gg/the-eye #books). Programmers are needed to help re-envision the web frontend, search engine, or distribution model ( https://gitlab.com/libgen1 ). The entirety of Library Genesis is open-source, so anyone is welcome to reimagine the project. Here's what else our communities accomplished in technical details: Swarm peers increased from 3,000 seeders to 30,000 seeders! Swarm speeds increased from about 60KB/s on most torrents to over 100MB/s, thanks to the joint Seedbox.io and NFOrce.nl dedicated server and everyone else seeding. Refreshed and indexed 2,400 .torrent files, replacing 100+ dead trackers with new, live announce URLs The-Eye.eu began to prepare and hash-check the collection for archiving, more to come on that (TBA) Endless thanks to everyone at the-eye.eu , all the volunteers, Seedbox.io/NFOrce.nl, and UltraSeedbox for coming together to make this project happen. We brought science around the world with our torrenting, one of the many big steps in permanently unchaining and preserving all of this knowledge for humanity. https://preview.redd.it/coz7hvkh3s541.png Relevant Links https://phillm.net/libgen-seeds-needed.php https://phillm.net/libgen-stats-table.php \"Archivists Are Trying to Make Sure a ‘Pirate Bay of Science’ Never Goes Down\" by Matthew Gault in Vice News TorrentFreak's coverage by Andy /r/DataHoarder: Let's talk about datahoarding that's actually important: distributing knowledge and the role of Libgen in educating the developing world. /r/Seedboxes Charity Drive /r/Seedboxes Update"},

For this reason there are some real issues with the loads on the electrical circuits between my network storage, gaming PC, HTPCs and so on.  Plus just 'physical space' and noise limitations. As such, when my 16 drive UnRAID server ran out of drive slots, the only solution was to build a second server which is in the Livingroom, in a 4U Rosewill case, sitting discretely in an Ikea Lack table with caster wheels.  The main server has a Ryzen 9 3950X and does all the dockers and stuff.  The secondary server has an Intel E5 2697v2 and sits there eating electricity for the sake of letting me run 12 more drives. But we're moving!  Three floors!  Gonna run ethernet in all the walls.  There will be a finished basement area for 'the gaming goodness' and I can finally set up network and storage in a real rack, on the unfinished side of the basement, with it's own 15amp circuit and where no one will care how much noise anything in there makes.  That means I an get disk shelf and make all of this way less stupid! The main plan is to retire the server inside the 4U rack case, then transplant the main tower server into that 4U rack case and expand it's drive capacity with a disk shelf.  So here's where I have questions: Firstly, things like the NetApp DS4246 and related seem to be what I'm looking at.  All my drives are SATA, to these disk shelves support SATA out of the box, is additional hardware required for SATA drives, or do I need to look for something alternate/specific? Secondly, these shelves offer up to four PSUs for redundancy, but how many are needed at minimum assuming 'up time' is not a major concern?  Also what kind of power consumption should I see beyond the drives it's powering?  I should def see an advantage over a whole 11 year old Xeon running, right? Thirdly, for the 'host server' to access this kind of disk shelf, I should only require something like an LSI 9201-16E and a quartet of 8088 to SFF-8088 cables, right?  From there on, the host device should just have an LSI controller which see's up to 24 drives on it, and it's all happy and 'just works'?"},

I currently have a small RAID 1 file server running Samba and while I manually copy files from my computers to this server, I wanted to see if there was software that could automated this. The goal is for this software to automatically copy a new completed file placed in the documents folder to a  network drive that is available on the same computer. Literally \"copy this file over there when it exists\". I looked into FreeFileSync and Syncthing but these appear to sync directly to a server instead to a local folder. One additional thing I an looking for is two-way syncing. This way, I can make a \"universal\" document folders where all my computers will have the same content, and update them if they are missing anything. This could count as additional backup since I would have the same files over many computers. Does anyone have recommendations for a software solution? Preferably: Open source \"Live\" syncing (runs when new or changed file detected instead of scheduled syncing) Flexible / Plenty of Options / Configurable Uses native Windows file commands Doesn't hurt, but works on Linux (I have \"better\" options for my Linux machines though) I appreciate any recommendations! Edit: I remember SyncToy which would be perfect, if anyone knows of an open source version of SyncToy, then that would be what I am looking for!"},

Some backstory: I had an unfortunate ssd failure which cost me about $1000 to recover the files. After some research I've decided to set up a NAS w/ RAID1 (and other back up methods). Now I have some questions to help me transition/transfer/migration from my old external hdd setup to my NAS solution. My first question mainly revolves around keeping file integrity when transferring files. What programs are best at doing this? I've done some research and I've currently chosen TeraCopy. It looks pretty good; other posts have suggested stuff like Robocopy but I couldn't find/get it to work (maybe it's command line stuff that, though I admittedly didn't look too hard since I don't trust inbuilt windows stuff that much). How good is TeraCopy and its file integrity verification? My second question is about checking files for corruption, mainly videos. This one is a bit of a shot in the dark, a hail mary hope of mine that I can fix this headache inducing rookie mistake of mine. Long story short, I had to reinitialize my NAS due to changing its setup. When doing this, I copied data I had on the NAS to a ext HDD (no verification done, I now know it was a stupid rookie mistake) totaling approx 3.5 TB of data, mainly video files (probably around 1k hours). Now I found at least 1 of them has a bit of corruption, where about 20 seconds got messed up. Is there a way or program that can find these kind of problems with files? I'm guessing probably not, but if there are potential solutions I'd love to find them. Otherwise, I guess those errors/problems will just exist and years later I'll find out and lament that if I knew years ago I could have replaced those files but not when I do. Thanks for your help and I'll reply if I have any follow up questions."},

The outpour of support for the project still leaves me in total awe. Thousands of people around the world joined our seeding effort donating bandwidth, storage, and expertise. Today we announce that the final set of 1,000 books is now seeded, saved, and preserved. Stunning generosity and heart. But our volunteers couldn’t stop at books. We have already started to secure and preserve a new library of 80 million scientific articles. And now thanks to the brave librarians at Library Genesis and SciHub and all the volunteer seeders the collections can never be taken away from humanity. Why are Library Genesis and SciHub vital to humanity? Library Genesis and SciHub set out to share every scientific article and every scientific book with every single person on Earth. Their initiative fulfills United Nations/UNESCO world development goals that mandate the removal of restrictions on access to science. Big publishing companies just want “open access,” representing only about 28% of articles, and no books. They want the rest of humanity’s accumulated scientific knowledge to remain locked up behind paywalled databases and unaffordable textbooks. We said fuck that. Limiting and delaying humanity’s access to science isn’t a business, it’s a crime, one with an untold number of victims and preventable deaths. Doctors and scientists in the developing world already face unbelievable challenges in their jobs. Tearing down paywalls between them and the knowledge they need to fight for health and freedom in their homeland is the least we can do to help. How can I help? Reddit’s support has been huge. In December the project’s story was published in Vice, receiving 60,000 upvotes across r/technology , r/futurology , r/datahoarder , and r/seedboxes , and shared to readers around the world in international technology news. That’s just for seeding the torrents! Imagine the stories of knowledge brought to doctors and scientists and students around the world. They hold an incredible story to tell. We need their stories next, and we can bring the crisis of access to knowledge into view with our upvotes. Our seeding project has been an incredible success thanks to literal 24/7 work of our volunteers over the last month. Seedbox.io and their provider NFOrce.nl donated a dedicated high-speed server to seed the full Library Genesis book collection. The-Eye.eu is both seeding and archiving the entirety of both library collections. You’re also welcome to join The-Eye.eu’s discord to learn how you can help seed (discord.gg/the-eye #books). Programmers are needed to help re-envision the web frontend, search engine, or distribution model ( https://gitlab.com/libgen1 ). The entirety of Library Genesis is open-source, so anyone is welcome to reimagine the project. Here's what else our communities accomplished in technical details: Swarm peers increased from 3,000 seeders to 30,000 seeders! Swarm speeds increased from about 60KB/s on most torrents to over 100MB/s, thanks to the joint Seedbox.io and NFOrce.nl dedicated server and everyone else seeding. Refreshed and indexed 2,400 .torrent files, replacing 100+ dead trackers with new, live announce URLs The-Eye.eu began to prepare and hash-check the collection for archiving, more to come on that (TBA) Endless thanks to everyone at the-eye.eu , all the volunteers, Seedbox.io/NFOrce.nl, and UltraSeedbox for coming together to make this project happen.

Stupid me. It was a full format, not a quick format, but I stopped it only a second or two after it had started. I ran testdisk to check the damages and try to recover the files; it didn't really work all too well. I tried to run photorec, but the software is unusable - my input was randomized and would constantly change if it even accepted input at all; this wasn't a mapping issue, as the right arrow key would act as arrow up, enter, arrow down, or any other random input at any given time. Either way, I eventually found and ran R-Studio's R-Linux, which seemed to work fine, if a little unintuitive. I ran the software and seemingly recovered a lot of files; among others, I recovered a lot of mp4 files. This was expected, as the drive was filled almost exclusively with videos. However, R-Linux does not have built in capabilities to recover webms or other video file formats like qt, and I know there were a great deal of those files on the drive. Does anyone know of any good ways to recover those files as well? I know R-Linux has the ability to add custom file types by building an xml file for that type. I wouldn't know where to begin on getting the information for such a file, but does anyone have one that would work for the not included video file types (webm, qt, etc.)? Or does anyone know of a software that has the ability to recover those files?"},

Less idiot proof devices don't have this nonsense but are weird about backing them up. It all feels very bloatwary to a home-NAS newbie I JUST need a dumb networked file box WITHOUT all the apps and features QNAP and Synolgoy bring to the table. I need it to be JUST a network share that I can access from any device on my home network using the file browsers on those devices. No video managers, DSM's, BSM's, photo managers, or any of the usual stuff. Just files, in a file browser, that I can doubleclick to open. Jut a dumb, quiet , reliable, file box. I want to be able to backup this dumb file box by mapping it to a drive letter on the backup pc and then run my backup script. No bullshit with installing third party synology/qnap/whatever software, I just want to integrate it in my existing backup solutions and ignore what vendors want me to do.

No short vids or re-recordings that include interruptions. Simple. All of it. The show used to be quite popular; the entire content should be out there, internet, or stored. **Since some ask. Why do I want it?** I want it cause it has been suppressed and repressed on the internet, and various sites and people tell me what I saw and heard didn't happen, and it bothers me.

It has since also been upgraded to the latest firmware from LSI/Broadcom, which is 12.15.0-0239 (also the card at boot identifies as BIOS version \"3.30.02.2 (Build June 17, 2014)\"). I am just simply using it in my Windows 10 system, not as part of a server or NAS. This card had been disconnected from my system for about 6-12 months, as well as it's drives, I recently reconnected everything in a new system. I have four HDDs in a RAID5, but had recently acquired the license key to enable RAID6 and had installed a 5th HDD in preparation for that. I had a few errors at first, but many things in the system were at first giving me errors so I didn't think much of it as I had performed several upgrades and changes at once. I eventually got everything booting properly and then opened up the RAID Windows management software (Version 17.05.02.01 at the time) and it seemed to be going ok. It was performing a Patrol Read on all of my drives and was recharging the battery (Though it claimed the battery was bad, but it was new, so I figured it needed to do a recharge cycle and re-learn to see it as good again). It said the Patrol Read was only going to take 10 minutes but I knew it was going to take hours. Halfway in, at about the 3-4 hour mark, the software completely stopped responding. I restarted it, and now the card was showing that absolutely nothing was installed to it. I performed a reboot and now I kept getting an error message during the card's initialization during post: LSI MegaRAID SAS-MFI BIOS Version 3.30.02.2 (Build June 17, 2014) Copyright(c) 2014 LSI Corporation Host Adapter Bus 5 Dev 0: F/W is in Fault State MFI Register State 0xF0010002 Adapter at Baseport is not responding No MegaRAID Adapter Installed The card then could be seen as installed, but the drives were not showing up, and the management software could not even tell a card was installed anymore. I tried updating to the latest management software (17.05.06.00) in case it might at least see there is a card installed, with that being it's own can of worms of expecting me to manually install OpenJDK and set the environment paths myself, it also just gets stuck loading the application. I tried MegaCLI, StorCLI, and MegaSCU (I admit I am not too familiar with managing this card through a CLI) but -v and -AdpAllInfo -aALL but they all returned nothing. I tried disconnecting the drives in case one had somehow become so fault during storage that it was crashing it, and no difference. I tried the only other PCI socket in my motherboard and it would not even boot then, guess that socket isn't even working with everything else installed in my system. I have no idea what to do now. The card refuses to work, claiming it's suffering some kind of firmware fault on POST, none of the software seems to even detect the presence of the card at all despite it physically showing up in Device Manager (although with an \"An I/O adapter hardware error has occurred.\" error) and HWiNFO, and I am not aware of any way I can attempt a force-reflash of the firmware in case it's a software issue (although I somehow doubt it) or of what else to try.

{"Title": "RAID card no longer working, gives firmware error on POST", "Author": "u/Cyber_Akuma", "Content": "I have a LSI 9260-8i, this was actually reflashed from the original IRM ServeRAID M5014 it arrived as. It has since also been upgraded to the latest firmware from LSI/Broadcom, which is 12.15.0-0239 (also the card at boot identifies as BIOS version \"3.30.02.2 (Build June 17, 2014)\"). I am just simply using it in my Windows 10 system, not as part of a server or NAS. This card had been disconnected from my system for about 6-12 months, as well as it's drives, I recently reconnected everything in a new system. I have four HDDs in a RAID5, but had recently acquired the license key to enable RAID6 and had installed a 5th HDD in preparation for that. I had a few errors at first, but many things in the system were at first giving me errors so I didn't think much of it as I had performed several upgrades and changes at once. I eventually got everything booting properly and then opened up the RAID Windows management software (Version 17.05.02.01 at the time) and it seemed to be going ok. It was performing a Patrol Read on all of my drives and was recharging the battery (Though it claimed the battery was bad, but it was new, so I figured it needed to do a recharge cycle and re-learn to see it as good again). It said the Patrol Read was only going to take 10 minutes but I knew it was going to take hours. Halfway in, at about the 3-4 hour mark, the software completely stopped responding. I restarted it, and now the card was showing that absolutely nothing was installed to it. I performed a reboot and now I kept getting an error message during the card's initialization during post: LSI MegaRAID SAS-MFI BIOS Version 3.30.02.2 (Build June 17, 2014) Copyright(c) 2014 LSI Corporation Host Adapter Bus 5 Dev 0: F/W is in Fault State MFI Register State 0xF0010002 Adapter at Baseport is not responding No MegaRAID Adapter Installed The card then could be seen as installed, but the drives were not showing up, and the management software could not even tell a card was installed anymore. I tried updating to the latest management software (17.05.06.00) in case it might at least see there is a card installed, with that being it's own can of worms of expecting me to manually install OpenJDK and set the environment paths myself, it also just gets stuck loading the application. I tried MegaCLI, StorCLI, and MegaSCU (I admit I am not too familiar with managing this card through a CLI) but -v and -AdpAllInfo -aALL but they all returned nothing. I tried disconnecting the drives in case one had somehow become so fault during storage that it was crashing it, and no difference. I tried the only other PCI socket in my motherboard and it would not even boot then, guess that socket isn't even working with everything else installed in my system. I have no idea what to do now. The card refuses to work, claiming it's suffering some kind of firmware fault on POST, none of the software seems to even detect the presence of the card at all despite it physically showing up in Device Manager (although with an \"An I/O adapter hardware error has occurred.\" error) and HWiNFO, and I am not aware of any way I can attempt a force-reflash of the firmware in case it's a software issue (although I somehow doubt it) or of what else to try. And yes, I have a backup of my data."},

{"Title": "Mid tower case vs 4U chassis for DIY NAS?", "Author": "u/Neurrone", "Content": "Hi, I'm currently looking to upgrade from an O11 air mini that only holds 4 drives because I realized it would be nice to have more drive slots and inadequate airflow causing some drives to run hot (ambient 28 C, idle 45, 51 under load). I made the mistake of choosing a case that only has as many drives that I had, so wanted to do it right this time. Use case is TrueNas with some apps, running on Ryzen 5700G to optimize for idle power consumption. I don't yet have a rack, but will be getting one when I move. Hence, I shortlisted some 4U rackmounts to place vertically first on a shelf: Logic case sc-4316 : US$350, 16 drives Sliger CX4712 : US$399, 12 drives. I'm leaning towards this These 4u cases aren't available for me locally - so estimated shipping to get either of those is an extra US$200, though I'm trying to find out if I can reduce that somehow. On the other hand,, a tower like the Fractal Meshify 2 (US$150) is much cheaper, and available to me locally, so I don't have to pay much for shipping. I could get 3 of these with the money needed to get the 4U. In this situation, are there enough advantages of those 4U cases to justify the extra expense? If I get a rack, I think I could place the Meshify 2 on its side on a shelf so that it only takes 6U. I'm new to rackmounted chassis, so these are the pros and cons I'm weighing, let me know if I missed anything. Pros: Support for redundant PSUs, hot swappable fans and drives for less uptime in case of a failure Support for larger motherboards: I currently have an ATX, not sure how useful support for larger form factors would be if I upgrade to lower end server boards Designed for rack mounting, smaller footprint Cons: Expensive Requires fan swaps for silence Higher drive temperatures?

So here: got the drives here: https://www.ebay.com.sg/itm/204806952151 It was slightly cheaper when I got it. But it's one of the cheapest options you can find anywhere even now. The next step is 24TB drives which are not sold factory recertified as of yet, so they would cost.. about 50% more than this. I was concerned that some of the disks will arrive damaged, but as you can see it comes very well packaged, and they all passed testing. I put them into a Xpenology home made NAS. which is basically a itx motherboard inside a NAS case (jonsbo N1). It works like a charm. with one disk redundancy, I got about 80TB of fast storage. They cleared the hours on it when they recertified, but not the rest I think. But all the disks passed testing and are not making any suspicious noises or giving any issues. https://preview.redd.it/my-new-factory-recertified-22tb-seagate-hard-drives-v0-j8twcye0lx4d1.jpg Seagate 22TB Sata Hard Drives"},

{"Title": "Help! I erased one of four RAID volumes set up with Disk Utilities", "Author": "u/peterinjapan", "Content": "Hi, I'm having an issue with a RAID with a volume I accidentally erased. My Yottamaster RAID started becoming unstable and was beeping all the time, so after giving up on it, I bought a Logitech enclosure and put the drives in, creating a RAID 5 volume with SoftRaid 8. After I got everything set up, of my disks disappeared from the new RAID, and as I was verifying the other three, another one gave me issues. So I decided to format the \"new\" disks and try again. I seem to have had one of the volumes in my old (backup) RAID selected, and erased it. The backup RAID was, I think, set up as two striped RAID volumes, which were then striped together to create a raid of that. This might not be the best way to do a RAID, but there was no option other than striped or mirrored disks, and at the time SoftRaid was not working with Apple Silicon at all. I have bought a large external disk to serve as a working disk to hopefully save my data. Can anyone suggest what will happen when I use the Restore option in Disk Utilities? If I can save the files and hopefully the folder structure, that will be good.  If there are any other tools besides Disk Utility I should be exploring, please let me know. Sending the disks to a data service isn't an option as I'm in rural Japan."},

So unless you have been living under a rock, Reddit has decided to begin pay-tiering its API following the footsteps of Facebook, Google and very recently Twitter. And people are MAD ! Given that here at Reddit we are a more tech-competent audience, protest has been very interesting . We have seen Subreddit black-outs, user mass-deletions.. I think the funniest suggestion I heard came from u/IkePAnderson who suggested overwriting posts with gibberish instead. Except there's a problem: I think this general attitude will not only fail to bring change, it will give the company exactly what it wants. I mean, is there any form of dissent better than self-destruction? All the complaints being filed and the rage and vitriol are cleaning after themselves. Once the new pay-tiers come into effect, the evidence of people not welcoming the change will vanish as has already happened in the case of Facebook and Twitter whose API changes failed to attract much attention from the press. Reddit, for better or worse, is a company that derives its revenue from band-waggoning trends. The top subreddits on this site include r/funny , r/AskReddit , r/worldnews ; things that capture the here and now and are not so much concerned with posteriority. Might I remind you that just until a few months ago, threads older than 6 months would be locked not allowing further edits or comments. Reddit's revenue stream does not benefit from retaining history beyond a certain point and is only retained as a gesture for brand-loyalty. So if everyone who now despises Reddit removes their history, that's okay, those who are indifferent will get to keep the same benefits and it won't cost Reddit any more or less. I'm saying all of this to make a point that mass-deletion only hurts individuals. It hurts you, it hurts me; it hurts the dissent towards Reddit because the community becomes invisible.. Your content is yours. It's not property of Reddit. And therefore, if you so wish, you can move it to another platform. As a dissenter of the API overhaul, I think it is in our interest to do so. The fact that our content is portable in this way is a thing that scares companies, because it is dangerous. Just look at YouTube and Twitch to see how they force their big streamers into exclusivity contracts. I might be u/themadprogramer on Reddit, and my words might be attributed to that name. But I can also exist as @madpro on other platforms; whether on YouTube or Discord, or something fediversy like Mastodon or Pleroma. So I believe the best way we can petition our redress is not through mass-deletion, but rather mass-action. You're a data hoarder, just download a bulk of your comments and post to a blog. If you're not camera shy record yourself talking about the API changes and why you left Reddit and put it on YouTube or TikTok. Do you want to know the best part? Reddit can't do anything about it, even the skeptics who have suggested the possibility of the company to revert changes must concede that the company cannot suppress what is happening outside of their platform. If nothing else, I just think it's good practice to cross-post because redundancy means retention. Every one of us has a personal history and that is personal not Redditorial . That personal history is split across mediums, as it should be, because we move in the world. Reddit is merely the context, it is neither the object nor subject. The best form of protest can only be reclaiming our content instead of destroying it!"},

I am more comfortable running two 2x3TB raid 1 array, since then I know that the data is formatted such that I can fetch it without rebuilding.  Even asustor themselves does not have a method of recovering the data from an raid 5 array. I have been using snapraid before, and that is has been feeling more safe, as  when a drive has failed, only the data on that drive has potentially been lost.

{"Title": "Mid tower case vs 4U chassis for DIY NAS?", "Author": "u/Neurrone", "Content": "Hi, I'm currently looking to upgrade from an O11 air mini that only holds 4 drives because I realized it would be nice to have more drive slots and inadequate airflow causing some drives to run hot (ambient 28 C, idle 45, 51 under load). I made the mistake of choosing a case that only has as many drives that I had, so wanted to do it right this time. Use case is TrueNas with some apps, running on Ryzen 5700G to optimize for idle power consumption. I don't yet have a rack, but will be getting one when I move. Hence, I shortlisted some 4U rackmounts to place vertically first on a shelf: Logic case sc-4316 : US$350, 16 drives Sliger CX4712 : US$399, 12 drives. I'm leaning towards this These 4u cases aren't available for me locally - so estimated shipping to get either of those is an extra US$200, though I'm trying to find out if I can reduce that somehow. On the other hand,, a tower like the Fractal Meshify 2 (US$150) is much cheaper, and available to me locally, so I don't have to pay much for shipping. I could get 3 of these with the money needed to get the 4U. In this situation, are there enough advantages of those 4U cases to justify the extra expense? If I get a rack, I think I could place the Meshify 2 on its side on a shelf so that it only takes 6U. I'm new to rackmounted chassis, so these are the pros and cons I'm weighing, let me know if I missed anything. Pros: Support for redundant PSUs, hot swappable fans and drives for less uptime in case of a failure Support for larger motherboards: I currently have an ATX, not sure how useful support for larger form factors would be if I upgrade to lower end server boards Designed for rack mounting, smaller footprint Cons: Expensive Requires fan swaps for silence Higher drive temperatures? I assume drive temps would be worse compared to e.g, the meshify Won't fit my 160 mm cooler Thanks for reading!"},

So here: got the drives here: https://www.ebay.com.sg/itm/204806952151 It was slightly cheaper when I got it. But it's one of the cheapest options you can find anywhere even now. The next step is 24TB drives which are not sold factory recertified as of yet, so they would cost.. about 50% more than this. I was concerned that some of the disks will arrive damaged, but as you can see it comes very well packaged, and they all passed testing. I put them into a Xpenology home made NAS. which is basically a itx motherboard inside a NAS case (jonsbo N1). It works like a charm. with one disk redundancy, I got about 80TB of fast storage. They cleared the hours on it when they recertified, but not the rest I think.

{"Title": "Help! I erased one of four RAID volumes set up with Disk Utilities", "Author": "u/peterinjapan", "Content": "Hi, I'm having an issue with a RAID with a volume I accidentally erased. My Yottamaster RAID started becoming unstable and was beeping all the time, so after giving up on it, I bought a Logitech enclosure and put the drives in, creating a RAID 5 volume with SoftRaid 8. After I got everything set up, of my disks disappeared from the new RAID, and as I was verifying the other three, another one gave me issues. So I decided to format the \"new\" disks and try again. I seem to have had one of the volumes in my old (backup) RAID selected, and erased it. The backup RAID was, I think, set up as two striped RAID volumes, which were then striped together to create a raid of that. This might not be the best way to do a RAID, but there was no option other than striped or mirrored disks, and at the time SoftRaid was not working with Apple Silicon at all. I have bought a large external disk to serve as a working disk to hopefully save my data. Can anyone suggest what will happen when I use the Restore option in Disk Utilities? If I can save the files and hopefully the folder structure, that will be good.  If there are any other tools besides Disk Utility I should be exploring, please let me know. Sending the disks to a data service isn't an option as I'm in rural Japan."},

{"Title": "The infuriating things about communicating the importance of data hoarding to the average internet user", "Author": "u/volthunter", "Content": "This is inspired by a conversation I've had which often feels cyclical about how we are losing access to most of the data on the internet, Yuzu the switch emulator was taken down and with it many clones and spin off's, Vimm's lair has had it's Nintendo roms forcefully removed, internet archive is being sued and getting cease and desists, some from Nintendo some from other companies, we've lost a multitude of pirate websites as of late, but people think piracy \" cant be defeated\". My point being that in the past 2 years more damage has been done to the current scene of the internet and preservation than all the years prior, it's not just about piracy or emulation, it's more than that, google search was a vital core of the internet and it's been ripped out. It's like the adage that there is a man in Czechoslovakia maintaining a piece of software that is crucial to the internet's existence and multiple times that has proven to be true, and now google has fallen and the internet is worse for it. A big loss that most people don't know if is that visa through their various connections to right wing christian organisations was actively campaigned by mormon extremists to revoke funding from most of the main xxx websites such as pornhub and xhamster, this seems funny, but an incredible amount of material was lost and i don't think it wise to dismiss something like this as just some minor occurrence. This may have been one of the largest data losses ever, the loss of amateur content on pornhub represented billions of hours of video that is lost to time, and PornHub conclusively proved that it was a sham case set up by a mormon church that aims to ban all adult material and even then, they were forced to shut down a retaliatory case and to shut down the amateur section of the site because of pressure from visa. The government itself has made material that many corporations would prefer you don't have access to such as fixing old factory equipment and booklets on home electric repair, with the american governments currently starting the fight to launch right to repair, you must realise that the companies would prefer if you did not have that right or information, ifixit and it's guides would be eliminated. Even the people testing products, tech channels like linus and level 1 techs would all be eliminated in time, too much finds itself at odds with these companies and you think it's hypothetical but if you upload a video tearing down an iphone and repairing it, apple may take it down, they are known to do it, same for john deer tractor hacks and lg washing machine repair videos, this is a fight, and we are losing. Anyways, i just see things getting worse and frankly it seems like we aren't bouncing back how the internet seems to think we are, the torrent scenes are no where near as alive as they used to be, even with private trackers, the scene is a shadow of what it once was, and i only see it getting worse, so hoard, data hoard it all."},

I believe Arq does a full backup and incremental from then on. I know Macrium has this option also. My main need is software that will never delete a file from a backup, no matter if I delete the source file or move it. Retaining a few versions. Bonus would be the ability to mirror this backup to the cloud in some form.

Cost is certainly a consideration. I have two needs: Backups - I presently have 2 x 3TB 5.4k rpm HDDs for storage in a desktop nearby. This PC needs to be replaced as its old and dying slowly. The HDDs work great - used for cold storage. the PC is off most of the time. More working space. Presently, I just keep my MBP clear of working document - i only load one project at a time and work off the internal 500GB SSD. This works but is getting tedious. I typically edit in either iMovie or Davinci Resolve (depending on project needs) and would like to move this to a larger DAS. I'm thinking I'd like 1 DAS with 4 bays. But from who? OWC? MediaSonic? Configure the two HDDs into a single Raid 1 for local backups with redundancy. I'll copy files to cold storage as needed. This data is backed up to an external drive in a fire-safe and critical docs are backedup to the cloud as well. Configure two SSDs into a single Raid 1 for faster working space redundancy. I'll use these as working space for editing two or three streams of 1080.60 video. Once projects are finished, the final result and maybe the raw footage is saved to the HDDs for archival. Questions: General thoughts for this approach? I'm sure i'm not the only one doing this but I couldn't find anything. Maybe I should just go RAID 10 or 5 or something :( Is there a specific bus type to handle 2x 1 Raid? How do i know if a DAS can handle this 2x Raid 1 configuration? is any JBOD good enough? Suggestions for affordable DAS? Raid controllers? Do i use Disk Utility or the DAS's softwareraid? Who's got the best notification of a failed drive? Speed - ideally i'd like NVMe as it's fast and future proof (i.e. I'll eventually get into 4k filming, maybe). Are there boxes that have NVMe and HDD? I couldn't find any.

Once the new pay-tiers come into effect, the evidence of people not welcoming the change will vanish as has already happened in the case of Facebook and Twitter whose API changes failed to attract much attention from the press. Reddit, for better or worse, is a company that derives its revenue from band-waggoning trends. The top subreddits on this site include r/funny , r/AskReddit , r/worldnews ; things that capture the here and now and are not so much concerned with posteriority. Might I remind you that just until a few months ago, threads older than 6 months would be locked not allowing further edits or comments. Reddit's revenue stream does not benefit from retaining history beyond a certain point and is only retained as a gesture for brand-loyalty. So if everyone who now despises Reddit removes their history, that's okay, those who are indifferent will get to keep the same benefits and it won't cost Reddit any more or less. I'm saying all of this to make a point that mass-deletion only hurts individuals. It hurts you, it hurts me; it hurts the dissent towards Reddit because the community becomes invisible.. Your content is yours. It's not property of Reddit. And therefore, if you so wish, you can move it to another platform. As a dissenter of the API overhaul, I think it is in our interest to do so. The fact that our content is portable in this way is a thing that scares companies, because it is dangerous. Just look at YouTube and Twitch to see how they force their big streamers into exclusivity contracts. I might be u/themadprogramer on Reddit, and my words might be attributed to that name. But I can also exist as @madpro on other platforms; whether on YouTube or Discord, or something fediversy like Mastodon or Pleroma. So I believe the best way we can petition our redress is not through mass-deletion, but rather mass-action. You're a data hoarder, just download a bulk of your comments and post to a blog. If you're not camera shy record yourself talking about the API changes and why you left Reddit and put it on YouTube or TikTok. Do you want to know the best part? Reddit can't do anything about it, even the skeptics who have suggested the possibility of the company to revert changes must concede that the company cannot suppress what is happening outside of their platform. If nothing else, I just think it's good practice to cross-post because redundancy means retention. Every one of us has a personal history and that is personal not Redditorial . That personal history is split across mediums, as it should be, because we move in the world. Reddit is merely the context, it is neither the object nor subject.

My point being that in the past 2 years more damage has been done to the current scene of the internet and preservation than all the years prior, it's not just about piracy or emulation, it's more than that, google search was a vital core of the internet and it's been ripped out. It's like the adage that there is a man in Czechoslovakia maintaining a piece of software that is crucial to the internet's existence and multiple times that has proven to be true, and now google has fallen and the internet is worse for it. A big loss that most people don't know if is that visa through their various connections to right wing christian organisations was actively campaigned by mormon extremists to revoke funding from most of the main xxx websites such as pornhub and xhamster, this seems funny, but an incredible amount of material was lost and i don't think it wise to dismiss something like this as just some minor occurrence. This may have been one of the largest data losses ever, the loss of amateur content on pornhub represented billions of hours of video that is lost to time, and PornHub conclusively proved that it was a sham case set up by a mormon church that aims to ban all adult material and even then, they were forced to shut down a retaliatory case and to shut down the amateur section of the site because of pressure from visa. The government itself has made material that many corporations would prefer you don't have access to such as fixing old factory equipment and booklets on home electric repair, with the american governments currently starting the fight to launch right to repair, you must realise that the companies would prefer if you did not have that right or information, ifixit and it's guides would be eliminated. Even the people testing products, tech channels like linus and level 1 techs would all be eliminated in time, too much finds itself at odds with these companies and you think it's hypothetical but if you upload a video tearing down an iphone and repairing it, apple may take it down, they are known to do it, same for john deer tractor hacks and lg washing machine repair videos, this is a fight, and we are losing. Anyways, i just see things getting worse and frankly it seems like we aren't bouncing back how the internet seems to think we are, the torrent scenes are no where near as alive as they used to be, even with private trackers, the scene is a shadow of what it once was, and i only see it getting worse, so hoard, data hoard it all."},

My main need is software that will never delete a file from a backup, no matter if I delete the source file or move it. Retaining a few versions.

Cost is certainly a consideration. I have two needs: Backups - I presently have 2 x 3TB 5.4k rpm HDDs for storage in a desktop nearby. This PC needs to be replaced as its old and dying slowly. The HDDs work great - used for cold storage. the PC is off most of the time. More working space. Presently, I just keep my MBP clear of working document - i only load one project at a time and work off the internal 500GB SSD. This works but is getting tedious. I typically edit in either iMovie or Davinci Resolve (depending on project needs) and would like to move this to a larger DAS. I'm thinking I'd like 1 DAS with 4 bays. But from who? OWC? MediaSonic? Configure the two HDDs into a single Raid 1 for local backups with redundancy. I'll copy files to cold storage as needed. This data is backed up to an external drive in a fire-safe and critical docs are backedup to the cloud as well. Configure two SSDs into a single Raid 1 for faster working space redundancy. I'll use these as working space for editing two or three streams of 1080.60 video. Once projects are finished, the final result and maybe the raw footage is saved to the HDDs for archival. Questions: General thoughts for this approach? I'm sure i'm not the only one doing this but I couldn't find anything. Maybe I should just go RAID 10 or 5 or something :( Is there a specific bus type to handle 2x 1 Raid? How do i know if a DAS can handle this 2x Raid 1 configuration? is any JBOD good enough? Suggestions for affordable DAS? Raid controllers? Do i use Disk Utility or the DAS's softwareraid? Who's got the best notification of a failed drive? Speed - ideally i'd like NVMe as it's fast and future proof (i.e. I'll eventually get into 4k filming, maybe). Are there boxes that have NVMe and HDD? I couldn't find any.

I also backed up the actual Photo Libraries that the app loads back when they were manageable sizes that could be stored on my computer. When I did work for distance learning, downloaded images, etc, the amount of images I generated skyrocketed. Since then iCloud's image recognition and character recognition abilities have become exceptional in my opinion, even processing frames of videos. However, this is not available on the desktop app. My efficiency has increased, as on my phone I can search my indexed library going back years by date, location, subject, and text. As of late I have been delighted to see that I can also search by text for images in folders on my Mac. I want to reap these benefits on an external storage drive. I've seen multiple image library applications with OCR capabilities. I understand that they are not able to handle such a large volume of images. I do like the convenience of scrolling through a library and am interested in hearing suggestions for these, although I have done some research myself. An issue that it poses is (in my experience) libraries doubling the amount of space my images take up by making their own copies for the library, and if I attempted to put all my photos into libraries that would take up so much space. I wonder if an idea I have has been executed by anyone other than Apple: is there any program that will alter the metadata, or create an index independent of a library app, such that I could search by text within Finder(/file explorer)?

Apparently misrepresents actual disk space. ZFS: Super bad because will never be in Linux tree, and is hard to maintain, apparently \"just hype\" https://www.reddit.com/r/zfs/comments/sfo1tq/linus_tech_tips_fails_at_using_zfs_properly_loses/ https://storytime.ivysaur.me/posts/why-not-zfs/ https://github.com/openzfs/zfs/labels/Type%3A%20Defect And then we had that corruption bug in ZFS.

Large storage capacity with fast read and write speeds. RAID capability for data loss protection.

A \"set it and forget it\" solution that won't require frequent upgrades or replacements.

Currently I'm using 68 of 80TB, and I think it grows slowly enough to still last me a bit. I'll have the backup system and don't really mind downtime so I'm wondering if RAIDz/1 parity is enough for my purposes? Or does it really make the difference to do RAIDz2 with 20tb drives?

So, here are some considerations I have. The replacement absolutely must be 7200 RPM, and a similar performance. Applications regularly load from this drive so a 5400 RPM drive is not an option. No matter what, this has to hold true. A quieter drive without losing capacity would be very nice. I'd be alright swapping for something like a 4 TB Blue if it was comparable. Alternatively, a size upgrade would also be great. I've heard the Exos X18 16 TB is good and also pretty fast. How much worse would the noise be compared to the Black?

So, here are some considerations I have. The replacement absolutely must be 7200 RPM, and a similar performance. Applications regularly load from this drive so a 5400 RPM drive is not an option. No matter what, this has to hold true. A quieter drive without losing capacity would be very nice. I'd be alright swapping for something like a 4 TB Blue if it was comparable. Alternatively, a size upgrade would also be great. I've heard the Exos X18 16 TB is good and also pretty fast. How much worse would the noise be compared to the Black?

However, there are still two things I can't figure out (or find recent opinions about at least). My first issue is choosing an internal burner to buy. Currently I only have an array of old DVD drives to batch rip old DVDs and no experience regarding bluray/M-DISK. I feel like I can only find product recommendations that are quite a few years old and it feels like one year people tend to recommend pioneer over everything else and another year its only LG and the year after pioneer again and so on... On top I can't figure out what to even watch out for. For example the currently available Pioneer drives BDR-S12XLT, BDR-213EBK, BDR-S13EBK, etc. all offer the same compatibility, same write speeds, same read speeds, and according as to how I read their product page the exact same features. Is there even something in a technical data sheet I can use to judge whether one drive might be more reliable for my use case than the other? What drives do you use/recommend in 2024 and why? My base line requirement is just burning M-DISKs (single/dual layer) and occasionally ripping a Blu-ray. Linux support would be highly appreciated but I can fall back to a windows system I have to keep running for other legacy scanning software anyways. For backing up old collections of media which won't change I guess how to do it is pretty straight forward. However, I'd also like to backup folders that like to change and grow like my document folders. These changing folders by far do not even come close to fill up the capacity of any M-DISK as of now. So I'd like to regularly keep burning info about recent changes/new files only on the same disk to not waste e.g. a 25 GB disk every time I backup a 3 GB folder. I originally intended to write a few small scripts that would keep track of changes/new files since last backup and manage versioning for writing/restoring those. However, I feel like reinventing the wheel here but can't really find the software I am looking for. Any simple and open source software recommendations there? Thanks for your input!"},

And then again, what do I even do with the digital copies if I do make them besides hoard them? I legally couldn’t share them most likely. I wouldn’t mind digitizing a copy and sending it to the original owner, but since it’s just a random lot online from a resale shop, there’s nothing really to go off of.

Now in the near future my SSD_A will be full. So I want to do the following: I want to buy a very large HDD use that as a backup and then use the two SSDs as my standard mounts for the home server to save stuff to. Ideas I could use mergerfs to combine both external SSDs to one mount point. I need to to this for some of my applications. I could then use rsync to create my backups from the SSD-mergerfs-mount to the HDD. Hopefully there is an rsync flag to indicate that I do not want to sync already existing data again (even if it changed). This ensures that broken files will not overwrite healthy files on the HDD. Yes, I know that this means that changes to files won't be backed up but this is ok for my use case. I could use ext4 for all drives, cause there is no reason not to and I do not know anything else. What do the experts think? Does that sound like a good approach? Could anything go wrong? I do not care about write speed to the SSDs they are fast enough I do not need striping. I also do not care if some data gets lost between the back up cycles so I do not need RAID. Is mergerfs the best there is and is it easy to set up? Should I use anything else then ext4? ext4 has always been my go to and I do not really see anything wrong with it. File hashes seem to be unnecessary cause I can just not overwrite existing files, that seems to do the trick for my use case. Very much appreciate any feedback on my plan."},

The second drive is currently one-way synced to the primary hard drive using a rysnc script i wrote. I don't need to store changes or previous file versions. Just want to mirror one drive to another. While rsync gets the job done, it doesn't handle the above efficiently because any changes are seen as new files, which means it's constantly writing/re-writing large files to the secondary hard drive. If I change the name of a directory including 100+ GB of files, rather than just similarly rename the directory of the secondary hard drive, rsync will delete all of the files, create a new directory, and re-sync all of those files. If I rename a file, rysnc will delete the file and then rewrite it. If I add a MacOS file tag to the file, rysnc will delete the file and then rewrite it. Thus, if I make any directory changes or tags, rsync can take hours (even days) to re-sync. I can imagine that's not healthy on either drive. It would be great if MacOS had a native function that said \"if I do anything to Drive A, do the same thing to Drive B\", but I haven't found it if it exists.

I got one called \"video download helper\" especially for the task but it just doesn't work with FB. I'm also a fan of Jdownloader but again that doesn't work with FB. Secondly I know you can switch \"www\" for \"mbasic\" and find the actual URLs of videos. You can then download them but ONLY it seems in the lowest possible quality. I suspect the URL just needs to be changed slightly to give me the high quality but I don't know how. What do you guys suggest?"},

In fact it's quite weird. The broken one is less than 1 month old. It's a WD red pro 18TB. I bought it from Amazon. Amazon agreed to send me a brand new replacement. But I need to return the broken one. So my question is: do I need to worry about the data safety? I know raid6 can only tolerate 2 disks failure. But some software claim be able to recover some information when even 3 disk failed. So I just wondering whether anyone can get some useful data from just 1 disk? Whether is it 0 risk or still some risk to send a disk of raid6 to others without erasing data? On my side, I cannot erase it because it even cannot be found when i put it into my PC. Regards,"},

{"Title": "Incremental M-DISK backups and drive choice", "Author": "u/ReactCereals", "Content": "Hello, so I have decided to revise my current backup strategy and opt for using off site M-DISK backups. However, there are still two things I can't figure out (or find recent opinions about at least). My first issue is choosing an internal burner to buy. Currently I only have an array of old DVD drives to batch rip old DVDs and no experience regarding bluray/M-DISK. I feel like I can only find product recommendations that are quite a few years old and it feels like one year people tend to recommend pioneer over everything else and another year its only LG and the year after pioneer again and so on... On top I can't figure out what to even watch out for. For example the currently available Pioneer drives BDR-S12XLT, BDR-213EBK, BDR-S13EBK, etc. all offer the same compatibility, same write speeds, same read speeds, and according as to how I read their product page the exact same features. Is there even something in a technical data sheet I can use to judge whether one drive might be more reliable for my use case than the other? What drives do you use/recommend in 2024 and why? My base line requirement is just burning M-DISKs (single/dual layer) and occasionally ripping a Blu-ray. Linux support would be highly appreciated but I can fall back to a windows system I have to keep running for other legacy scanning software anyways. For backing up old collections of media which won't change I guess how to do it is pretty straight forward. However, I'd also like to backup folders that like to change and grow like my document folders. These changing folders by far do not even come close to fill up the capacity of any M-DISK as of now. So I'd like to regularly keep burning info about recent changes/new files only on the same disk to not waste e.g. a 25 GB disk every time I backup a 3 GB folder. I originally intended to write a few small scripts that would keep track of changes/new files since last backup and manage versioning for writing/restoring those. However, I feel like reinventing the wheel here but can't really find the software I am looking for. Any simple and open source software recommendations there? Thanks for your input!"},

Plus it’s cheaper than shipping full sized VHS tapes. Unsurprisingly I’ll find home videos in the lots I buy. A part of me feels obligated to make digital copies since they’re someone’s memories, and also a time capsule of that period of time. Another part of me feels I shouldn’t because they are someone’s personal recording that I assume they had no plans to show outside of their homes. And then again, what do I even do with the digital copies if I do make them besides hoard them? I legally couldn’t share them most likely. I wouldn’t mind digitizing a copy and sending it to the original owner, but since it’s just a random lot online from a resale shop, there’s nothing really to go off of. I’ve found NSFW content as well, but the choice with that stuff is obvious and I just erase them. The normal, everyday stuff though I’m unsure about.

From the rules and the wiki it does seem ok, but I'm new to this sub. So currently I have two external SSDs for my home server. I'm using SSD_A to save all my stuff to it and SSD_B as a backup. Now in the near future my SSD_A will be full. So I want to do the following: I want to buy a very large HDD use that as a backup and then use the two SSDs as my standard mounts for the home server to save stuff to. Ideas I could use mergerfs to combine both external SSDs to one mount point. I need to to this for some of my applications. I could then use rsync to create my backups from the SSD-mergerfs-mount to the HDD. Hopefully there is an rsync flag to indicate that I do not want to sync already existing data again (even if it changed). This ensures that broken files will not overwrite healthy files on the HDD. Yes, I know that this means that changes to files won't be backed up but this is ok for my use case. I could use ext4 for all drives, cause there is no reason not to and I do not know anything else. What do the experts think? Does that sound like a good approach? Could anything go wrong? I do not care about write speed to the SSDs they are fast enough I do not need striping. I also do not care if some data gets lost between the back up cycles so I do not need RAID. Is mergerfs the best there is and is it easy to set up? Should I use anything else then ext4? ext4 has always been my go to and I do not really see anything wrong with it. File hashes seem to be unnecessary cause I can just not overwrite existing files, that seems to do the trick for my use case. Very much appreciate any feedback on my plan."},

Except it does SUCH a good job. You can set up sessions that copies when you run them - so update, mirror, things like that, to arbitrarily complex sets of disks and files. I use it extensively for backups to always know my files are backed up. It needs to be kicked off manually, but it just works so well and I like monitoring the steps. Most especially, I move files around between diff folders (think picture sorting, etc) and it will figure that out and \"move\" the files versus \"always re-copy\". So it really speeds everything up. So really what I use it for is \"make sure every file is backed up properly\" - and it does it really well - it \"never gives up until success\" no matter what happens. You can just re-run and make sure it's \"all up to date\". It supports Windows, Mac, and I think linux - so same on all platforms. It's donation-ware - and I think there is some more features if you donate - but I don't remember since I donated since the very beginning.

{"Title": "Most efficient method of syncing a primary drive to a back-up drive (MacOS)", "Author": "u/pipmike", "Content": "I could use advise on which syncing software to use for a Mac and two external hard drives. Scenario: I have one external hard drive as my primary \"hoard\" drive to which I actively add large files (1+ GB), move files to different folders, change file tags, etc. I have a second external hard drive that I use as my first-level disaster recovery in case my primary drive fails. The second drive is currently one-way synced to the primary hard drive using a rysnc script i wrote. I don't need to store changes or previous file versions. Just want to mirror one drive to another. While rsync gets the job done, it doesn't handle the above efficiently because any changes are seen as new files, which means it's constantly writing/re-writing large files to the secondary hard drive. If I change the name of a directory including 100+ GB of files, rather than just similarly rename the directory of the secondary hard drive, rsync will delete all of the files, create a new directory, and re-sync all of those files. If I rename a file, rysnc will delete the file and then rewrite it. If I add a MacOS file tag to the file, rysnc will delete the file and then rewrite it. Thus, if I make any directory changes or tags, rsync can take hours (even days) to re-sync. I can imagine that's not healthy on either drive. It would be great if MacOS had a native function that said \"if I do anything to Drive A, do the same thing to Drive B\", but I haven't found it if it exists. Thus, I'm looking at other options (Chronosync, Carbon Copy Cloner, etc.) that might be a better solution for my use case. Open for all suggestions or feedback."},

Redumper is pretty much the gold standard right now. AARU is also very well developed. DIC's original developer sort-of abandoned it and it's regarded as a legacy dumper utility and will be phased out at some point. Edit: Some clarification. The original developer behind DIC didn't abandon it. Redumper is being chosen over DIC where applicable and/or possible. These programs' inception originate to the Redump.org , Video Game Preservation Collective, Gaming Alexandria and Hit Save! organizations and communities where, through Discord, a ton of collaboration has taken hold for proactive media preservation, the world over. It's a very sizable, but niche community of dedicated people very much akin to the VHS Decode and Domesday Laser Disc duplicator projects.

They can be used to preserve all forms of media. EAC, Exact Audio Copy, is a bit dated because it can not grab, for example, compact disc subcode https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_Disc_subcode Redumper can be found here: https://github.com/superg/redumper BOS (Binary Object Scanner) is an integral part of MPF for detection of copy protection mechanisms and can be found here: https://github.com/SabreTools/BinaryObjectScanner While EAC is a decent utility, it lacks the ability to grab all possible information written to a an optical disc.

All my data is ~250 GB, and I am looking for recommendations on what are some good external hard drives I can use! Although I am considering online cloud services, but I'm not sure if I want to pay a yearly subscription which has roughly the same annual cost similar to an external hard drive. I would prefer to pay for 2 hard drives and have it last for couple of years instead, rinse and repeat. I am looking to buy 2 hard drives, but am having a hard time decide which ones. I don't care about transfer speeds, and am looking for 500GB to 1 TB memory. The thing I care most about is that it lasts. I know there isn't any guarantee a that a external drive will last and could die any moment, but I would prefer it to last at least 5 years (hopefully 10 years) before I find a replacement. I generally do a back up 3-4 times a year, and let it collect dust on my shelf for the rest of the year. I was thinking of buying a HDD since I thought those last longer than SSDs, but apparently a bunch of websites on Google is telling me otherwise? That today's SSDs now last as long as HDDs or longer?

While I have since decided to build myself a proper NAS to serve as my primary storage (with external storage and a cloud service serving as the backups), a couple questions still remain in regards to my current practices with external storage: To my understanding, there are far better hashing algorithms than CRC32 but would they provide any tangible benefits over CRC32 solely from a data corruption perspective (e.g. a lower chance of hash remaining the same in the event of corruption, even if unlikely to begin with)? (I'm probably overthinking this one, but) does it matter if I have one checksum file per directory (that contains all the file hashes in said directory) as opposed to an individual file per item?

When I plugged it in the computer it was able to read it without issue. Knowing the fragility of the situation, I started to copy the whole drive instead of browsing it. After 10% or so it stopped working. I re-plugged it in a different port and retried with similar results (with a progress equally low). After that it became hard to read it so I stopped —I didn't want to damage it by forcing a huge transfer in an unstable condition. My current plan is to try to access it from some Linux distro and, if I can read it, copy by folders (everything is organized in main categories).

It could check if the file was created at the same time, instead of comparing the files one by one. What I've done so far: Tried using AntiDupl.NET but it would take too long to sort them one by one. Tried using dupeGuru but I can't verify the files actually being duplicates. A slight problem could be that some images are in .HEIC and some videos are in .HEVC format.

I first had a ScanSnap ix1600 and now I have the Epson ES-580W. Both are great scanners, although I like the ES-580W a bit better because it has a web interface. But now I have reached the point where I don't want to bring every existing scanner into my house just to see if it has the functions I want, simply because the internet doesn't provide enough information. Therefore, I am reaching out to you for help. I need a scanner that allows me to create a large number of different profiles, in which I can then scan to a network folder. The reason is that my family and I have a wide variety of different documents that all need to be scanned directly into the corresponding folders (around 60+ profiles/shortcuts). The ScanSnap only has a handful of profiles and even though the Epson has 300 contacts, I can ultimately only create 48 presets. And I would like to be able to customize the file prefixes for each profile. I am hoping the community can help me find a suitable scanner. It should have what the previous two had, but additionally, it is important to me that it: Has a web server where I can make my settings (create profiles, etc.) Has a lot of Network Folder Shortcuts. Or alot of Shortcuts in General. Can scan receipts well Can handle no less than 30 pages The Epson was pleasantly quiet, so it would be great if it wasn't too loud (not a main criterion) The cheaper, the better, but given the price range I am currently considering, I expect to find something around €800 or less with the desired features.

I've been importing the pictures and videos on my iPhones to my PC for the last decade. Sometimes the import function didn't work as expected and I had to import everything all over again. Long story short, I now have 3 folders: Folder 1: Old pictures that are in DICM folders. It branches out quite a bit and their names are IMG_0001. Folder 2: A folder with pictures and videos split into two folders. Folder 3: Main folder that I want everything to be in. Most of it is right, but I'm sure it is missing the older pictures and videos in Folder 1. What I'm looking for: I want the pictures and videos to be chronologically placed so I can go through them without interruption. Preferably a program that would look at the 3 folders and create a new folder with all the files organized like 2024-05-28_IMG_0001. Remove duplicates so they don't occupy space unnecessarily. It could check if the file was created at the same time, instead of comparing the files one by one. What I've done so far: Tried using AntiDupl.NET but it would take too long to sort them one by one. Tried using dupeGuru but I can't verify the files actually being duplicates. A slight problem could be that some images are in .HEIC and some videos are in .HEVC format. I don't mind them being in that format as I use ImageGlass to view the pictures and VLC to view the videos. Extra: I'd appreciate if anybody have a good method of backing up their pictures and videos on their iPhone."},

{"Title": "Sagittarius NAS Case Review and Build Tips", "Author": "u/Ben4425", "Content": "I recently rebuilt my NAS by moving it from a Fractal Node 804 case into the Sagittarius NAS case available from AliExpress. The Node 804 was a good case, with great temps, but swapping hard drives around was a pain. The 804 is also ginormous. So, why the Sagittarius? It met my requirements for MATX, eight externally accessible drive bays, and what appeared to be good drive cooling. I also considered: Audheid K7. Only had two 92mm fans and some reviews reported high drive temps. Also required buying a Flex PSU. Audheid 8-Bay 2023 Edition. Provides better cooling with two 120mm fans but still required a Flex PSU if you wanted all 8 drive bays. Jonsbo N4. Only 4 bays were externally accessible and it only has one 120mm fan. Overall, I'm happy with the Sagittarius case. Its very compact yet it holds 8 drives, an MATX motherboard, and four 120mm fans. My drive and CPU temps are excellent. But, you really need to plan your build because there's no documentation, no cable management, and because some connectors are hidden by other components. If you don't plug in your cables as you build then you'll never get to them later after the build is complete. You also need think about air flow which I'll discuss after documenting my build. Time for some photos, starting with the empty case. Empty Case The two small rectangular holes in the upper and bottom left are all you have for routing cables from this, the motherboard side, to the hard drives on the other side. I ran 4 SATA cables through each of these holes. My motherboard mounts 4 of its SATA Ports along the edge so I had to plug those in before installing the motherboard itself. Otherwise, those connectors would have been practically inaccessible: Motherboard Edge Connector Issues The case supports two 2.5 SSD drives that are screwed to the bottom of the case. But, if you do, they will be flush to the case so plugging in cables will be near impossible. I purchased some 1/4\" nylon standoffs and longer M3-10 screws to elevate the SSDs a bit. It was still a pain to plug in the cables (because they are toward the bottom of this photo) but it worked: https://preview.redd.it/sagittarius-nas-case-review-and-build-tips-v0-31oe40fbxq2d1.jpg I routed all my SATA and fan cables next. I have 10 SATA ports total, two for SSDs and 8 for HDDs. Four of those interfaces are on an ASM-1064 PCIe add-on board and the rest are on the motherboard. Then, it was time for the power supply. I strongly suggest using a modular SFX power supply that typically comes with shorter cables. Long, or unnecessary, cables will be an issue because there's no place to put them. Also note you should plug in the EPS power cable before you install the power supply because you'll never get to it afterward: EPS Power Connector Also make sure you route the SATA power cable before installing the power supply. Last, install the fans. Standard 25mm thickness fans just barely clear the main motherboard power cable at the bottom of this picture. Also note I installed fan grills on all my fans otherwise (for my airflow) the cables would have hit the fan blades: Finished Interior Now, about the \"drive sleds\". This case only provides rubber bushings and screws to fasten those bushings to the sides of your hard drives. They also provide a metal plate with a bend that acts as the handle to pull the drive from the case: \"Drive Sled\" This is really basic but I found it works well. Wrapping up, here's a photo of the finished product. You can see the slots on the right that hold the rubber bushings that are attached to the hard drives. Final Result w/o Drive Bay Cover I installed four 120mm Phanteks fans (from my old Node 804) into this case and all of them are configured to exhaust air from the case. There are two behind the grill on the left of this picture and you can see that the fan screws just go through the grating holes. Air for the left side of the case is pulled in through holes in the rear and a large grating on the left side of the case (not visible here). So, on the left, air is pulled from the side and down towards the CPU and motherboard before exhausting out the front. On the right, there are two fans behind the hard drive cage. They too exhaust air that is pulled from the front of the case, past the hard drives, and then blown out the rear. There's maybe 5mm space between the drives so airflow is unimpeded. At 22c ambient, my idle drive temps vary from 24c to 27c. Not bad! As I said earlier, I'm happy. The case is very compact (about 300x260x265 mm), holds eight 3.5\" drives, two 2.5\" SSDs, and runs cool. For about $180, which included shipping to Massachusetts, I think it was a good purchase. That said, it isn't perfect: No cable management features. No fans are included, you must provide your own. Standard ATX PSU are supported but IMHO are impractical due to the larger PSU size and longer cables. Cable management would be a mess . FYI, the case has one USB 3.0 Type A port and one USB-C port on the front. Both of these are wired to the same USB 3.0 motherboard cable so the USB-C port will be limited to USB 3.0 speeds (5 Gbps). I.e. the USB-C port is wired to a USB 3.0 port on the motherboard."},

{"Title": "Compatibility between SATA Add-On Cards & NAS OSes (TrueNAS, Unraid, etc)?", "Author": "u/McFlyParadox", "Content": "I am just starting work on my first DIY NAS. It's going to either run Plex directly, or host files for Plex (still figuring that part out). I selected the Silverstone CS382 for the case, because I liked it size; that it had 8x hot swap drive bays; has a slot for a slim ODD so that I can do some limited BDR rips for cold storage; and that the motherboard tray is inverted, potentially allowing for full-length GPUs if I decide to run Plex directly (I end up transcoding a lot because I need subtitles on). The only thing I don't really care for is that the largest motherboard it can accept is mATX, which has less to do with the size and more to do with current trends that exist on modern mATX boards. Basically, most modern mATX boards seem to sacrifice SATA port count in favor of dedicating the PCIe lanes to NVMe slots instead. I get it: between their speed and lack of cables, NVMe are pretty neat (*rim shot*), but not really what I need for this build. It seems that most mATX boards top out around 4x SATA ports (LGA 1700 Intel mATX boards seem to top out at 4x; some AM5 AMD mATX boards will go up to 6x, but most are 4x), and instead offer 2-3x NVMe slots instead. So what I am wondering is this: Has anyone tried using SATA add-on cards in a situation like this? Not a RAID card, just \"here is some SATA ports and a chip a tie them into the PCIe lanes\". I've found a couple of items like the Vantec M.2 PCIe Gen3x2 to 5 ports SATA III expansion card that look like they might get me up to 9x SATA ports, which will be enough to get me my 8x hotswap bays operational and the slim ODD drive. But what I am concerned about is that 4x of the SATA ports will be \"proper\" ones on the motherboard and 5x will be \"add-ons\", and I am not sure how that might affect a RAID 5 or 6 array. Side note that may change people's answers: there is a non-zero chance that if I decide to run Plex directly on this box, I may just make it a server running Ubuntu or Windows instead, and figure out either a software RAID 5 or 6, JBOD, or just plain drives and remote backup."},

Also note you should plug in the EPS power cable before you install the power supply because you'll never get to it afterward: EPS Power Connector Also make sure you route the SATA power cable before installing the power supply. Last, install the fans. Standard 25mm thickness fans just barely clear the main motherboard power cable at the bottom of this picture. Also note I installed fan grills on all my fans otherwise (for my airflow) the cables would have hit the fan blades: Finished Interior Now, about the \"drive sleds\". This case only provides rubber bushings and screws to fasten those bushings to the sides of your hard drives. They also provide a metal plate with a bend that acts as the handle to pull the drive from the case: \"Drive Sled\" This is really basic but I found it works well. Wrapping up, here's a photo of the finished product. You can see the slots on the right that hold the rubber bushings that are attached to the hard drives. Final Result w/o Drive Bay Cover I installed four 120mm Phanteks fans (from my old Node 804) into this case and all of them are configured to exhaust air from the case. There are two behind the grill on the left of this picture and you can see that the fan screws just go through the grating holes. Air for the left side of the case is pulled in through holes in the rear and a large grating on the left side of the case (not visible here). So, on the left, air is pulled from the side and down towards the CPU and motherboard before exhausting out the front. On the right, there are two fans behind the hard drive cage. They too exhaust air that is pulled from the front of the case, past the hard drives, and then blown out the rear. There's maybe 5mm space between the drives so airflow is unimpeded. At 22c ambient, my idle drive temps vary from 24c to 27c. Not bad! As I said earlier, I'm happy. The case is very compact (about 300x260x265 mm), holds eight 3.5\" drives, two 2.5\" SSDs, and runs cool. For about $180, which included shipping to Massachusetts, I think it was a good purchase. That said, it isn't perfect: No cable management features. No fans are included, you must provide your own. Standard ATX PSU are supported but IMHO are impractical due to the larger PSU size and longer cables. Cable management would be a mess . FYI, the case has one USB 3.0 Type A port and one USB-C port on the front. Both of these are wired to the same USB 3.0 motherboard cable so the USB-C port will be limited to USB 3.0 speeds (5 Gbps). I.e. the USB-C port is wired to a USB 3.0 port on the motherboard."},

{"Title": "Compatibility between SATA Add-On Cards & NAS OSes (TrueNAS, Unraid, etc)?", "Author": "u/McFlyParadox", "Content": "I am just starting work on my first DIY NAS. It's going to either run Plex directly, or host files for Plex (still figuring that part out). I selected the Silverstone CS382 for the case, because I liked it size; that it had 8x hot swap drive bays; has a slot for a slim ODD so that I can do some limited BDR rips for cold storage; and that the motherboard tray is inverted, potentially allowing for full-length GPUs if I decide to run Plex directly (I end up transcoding a lot because I need subtitles on). The only thing I don't really care for is that the largest motherboard it can accept is mATX, which has less to do with the size and more to do with current trends that exist on modern mATX boards. Basically, most modern mATX boards seem to sacrifice SATA port count in favor of dedicating the PCIe lanes to NVMe slots instead. I get it: between their speed and lack of cables, NVMe are pretty neat (*rim shot*), but not really what I need for this build. It seems that most mATX boards top out around 4x SATA ports (LGA 1700 Intel mATX boards seem to top out at 4x; some AM5 AMD mATX boards will go up to 6x, but most are 4x), and instead offer 2-3x NVMe slots instead. So what I am wondering is this: Has anyone tried using SATA add-on cards in a situation like this? Not a RAID card, just \"here is some SATA ports and a chip a tie them into the PCIe lanes\". I've found a couple of items like the Vantec M.2 PCIe Gen3x2 to 5 ports SATA III expansion card that look like they might get me up to 9x SATA ports, which will be enough to get me my 8x hotswap bays operational and the slim ODD drive. But what I am concerned about is that 4x of the SATA ports will be \"proper\" ones on the motherboard and 5x will be \"add-ons\", and I am not sure how that might affect a RAID 5 or 6 array. Side note that may change people's answers: there is a non-zero chance that if I decide to run Plex directly on this box, I may just make it a server running Ubuntu or Windows instead, and figure out either a software RAID 5 or 6, JBOD, or just plain drives and remote backup."},

Note that \"for two media types\" here means more than one provider service (i.e. not just google). Questions: Do you use a storage service that looks similar, with plain old: files, folders, users, groups, permissions (read, write, admin) that you're happy with?  That covers this requirement Do you have a good automated way to copy from google drive to create backups periodically?  That preserves security data (possibly versioning too). This could be to my own RAID/NAS at home. Is there any service in the cloud that backs up directly from google drive for you (for a price) that works well? Encryption: do you know of a seamless service that allows one to automatically add a layer of zero-trust security to particular folders on google drive (or elsewhere). E.g. Some documents are financial and sensitive enough that we'd like extra security, but it's a big pain to encrypt/decrypt these locally then upload/download to the shared area.

{"Title": "A PWL solution that worked for me, and alternative drives", "Author": "u/flossy_cake", "Content": "I have the 12TB WD Red Plus drive.  It thumps every 5 seconds due to PWL.  It is annoying.  I was able to shut it up with this specific type of anti shock bracket which suspends the drive on rubber posts from all 4 sides.   You will need a 5.25\" bay in your PC case which are getting rarer these days. Available at the usual places like ebay, amazon, aliexpress etc. WARNING:  do not necessarily expect it to be a miracle solution for you straight away.  I have two 5.25\" bays and if I mount it in the top one I can still hear the thump.  If I use the bottom bay it is completely silent.   I don't know why.  I think it is something to do with resonation inside the case.   In the bottom silent bay I can put my ear right up to it and I hear no thump at all.  I can't explain it.  There is some trick to getting the drive suspended in just the right way that makes it not transfer any vibration.  I have read on some silent PC review site that people were suspending their drives in mid air inside the case with elastic bands.  Maybe it's like that.   When you are mounting the drive on the posts, inspect each post to make sure each one is making a perfect circular maximal contact patch on all 4 sides.  If one of the posts is bending slightly its contact patch will be smaller. It is easy to be slightly off and I think that affects how much vibration gets damped. Now for the alternatives:  I have two Western Digital 8TB blues (current model) which seem to not have PWL thump that I can tell.  Maybe they do, but I cannot hear it.   Or maybe it does it so rarely and quietly that I cannot tell it is happening.   But the 8TB blues have more platter spinning whoosh noise like \"hhhhhhhhhh\" so the 12TB red plus with silenced PWL is actually quieter. I will keep playing around with my top bay to get to the bottom of why it's still thumping despite the rubber mount.  Maybe one of the rubber posts went out of alignment or something.  I have it in the bottom bay right now and I can tell you there is no thump at all, none.  The drive has not gone to sleep. I was going to buy a second 12TB WD Red Plus but then I thought if they both thump every 5 seconds there is no guarantee both their thumps would be in sync so it could actually result in a thump every 2.5 seconds!   Imagine having four of them, it would be a thump every 1.25 seconds, oh my goodness!"},

I don't have any brand new tapes to use or a second tape drive so is it normal for used tapes to lose a lot of capacity and I will just have to account for this with a safer space margin?"},

I'm only seeing the original 5 no matter what I do. I thought maybe unplugging and old one and trying a new one could potentially let me know if I had too many, but then only the 4 drives showed up. They don't show up with fdisk -l, the don't show up in disks or gparted. I tried a USB enclosure to initialize them to see if that would help, and they did initialize, but once connected back to SATA, they don't show up.

I was recommended to use this since I can check \"verify files\" and it will do that after copying files on drive 1 and syncing to drive 2. Nobody said anything about checksum files. Not sure if it would be beneficial. I will rename files or add more files to the directory later on drive 1, then sync all the files to drive 2 again. If I need to do checksum, would I create a checksum for folders on drive 1, then start copy and sync to drive 2 but select \"do checksum at the end\" so it generates a second checksum on drive 2 that I can compare to the checksum from drive 1? Also do I need to choose \"store/verify checksum on ADS\"? (And should I use xx3-64 instead of MD5 now?) Thank you!"},

{"Title": "A PWL solution that worked for me, and alternative drives", "Author": "u/flossy_cake", "Content": "I have the 12TB WD Red Plus drive.  It thumps every 5 seconds due to PWL.  It is annoying.  I was able to shut it up with this specific type of anti shock bracket which suspends the drive on rubber posts from all 4 sides.   You will need a 5.25\" bay in your PC case which are getting rarer these days. Available at the usual places like ebay, amazon, aliexpress etc. WARNING:  do not necessarily expect it to be a miracle solution for you straight away.  I have two 5.25\" bays and if I mount it in the top one I can still hear the thump.  If I use the bottom bay it is completely silent.   I don't know why.  I think it is something to do with resonation inside the case.   In the bottom silent bay I can put my ear right up to it and I hear no thump at all.  I can't explain it.  There is some trick to getting the drive suspended in just the right way that makes it not transfer any vibration.  I have read on some silent PC review site that people were suspending their drives in mid air inside the case with elastic bands.  Maybe it's like that.   When you are mounting the drive on the posts, inspect each post to make sure each one is making a perfect circular maximal contact patch on all 4 sides.  If one of the posts is bending slightly its contact patch will be smaller. It is easy to be slightly off and I think that affects how much vibration gets damped. Now for the alternatives:  I have two Western Digital 8TB blues (current model) which seem to not have PWL thump that I can tell.  Maybe they do, but I cannot hear it.   Or maybe it does it so rarely and quietly that I cannot tell it is happening.   But the 8TB blues have more platter spinning whoosh noise like \"hhhhhhhhhh\" so the 12TB red plus with silenced PWL is actually quieter. I will keep playing around with my top bay to get to the bottom of why it's still thumping despite the rubber mount.  Maybe one of the rubber posts went out of alignment or something.  I have it in the bottom bay right now and I can tell you there is no thump at all, none.  The drive has not gone to sleep.

{"Title": "Expanding my Nas", "Author": "u/lgittens", "Content": "A couple years ago I miss judged my storage space needs. I should have bought a 8 bay nas but only purchased a four bay. I currently run plex off a ds418. 2x8tb and 2x18tb hybrid raid. I also have a 10tb currently not being used. Not sure what my next step should be Buy a two bay raid enclosure and a 10tb drive. This should last me a couple years. However I'm not sure what to get and if this may cause some lag while streeming. Buy 2x18tb drives or larger. Then I will have 3 drives not doing anything. This seems like a big waste until I upgrade my Nas which should be in a few years 2.Replace my Nas with a 8bay nas and buy another 10tb drive. This is not my favorite option as this will be the most expensive. My current Nas I would have to find a good home for. Somthing else to note is that my pc already has plenty of hd space. My goal is to use my pc for sorting and move all data to the Nas for storage. Any thoughts or suggestions would be appreciated."},

Every external storage device I’ve purchased has eventually had to be sent to repair services and be promptly replaced within a two to four year span - I’m now on my third harddrive, and have decided that I need a change to my approach. I am a college student with tons of personal digital memorabilia, from movies to OSTs and historical documents. After a period of time, the drives I’ve bought have consistently taken ages to mount & unmount, face a myriad of widely-spanning technical problems, and then promptly refuse to work. This has led to the decision that they will never, ever leave my areas of residence for fear of some whimsically-inclined failure. So I’m down on my luck, and thought I’d ask y’all for help since you folk seem dedicated enough to have some tips!! :D I suppose a list of what I’m generally looking for in a storage device would be helpful: Can be safely relocated, but incredibly rarely Can be accessed with immediacy (ie direct cables and not network shenanigans) Loads files at an incredibly accessible speed Preferably functions out of the box, some set-up is fine if it needs updates or a wizard, hesitant if it requires additional purchases Doesn’t require a 24/7 connection to a computer Is not OS-dependant, can be formatted to be read by anything Offers 5TB of storage or more Thank y’all so much for reading!!

This feature is now removed entirely with no plan to return after I have only had the \"lifetime\" plan for 2 months. I understand things change, so I reached out to politely request a refund and they said it was out of the 30 day window for a refund. So I am 60 days into a \"lifetime\" subscription and they will not do even a partial refund, after they removed the most important feature they sold me. Amazing business plan, offer many wonderful features and then remove them once you have customers money. I would like to point out that the photo upload worked terribly and inconsistently to begin with, and I really should have canceled much sooner, but I wanted to give a new company the benefit of the doubt. Also they recently released webdav, but it requires running your own server, which kind of defeats the purpose of webdav. Practically every other service lets you upload many different ways and deal with your own encryption. I made a terrible mistake and am out $1000. I should have listened to people's warnings that Internxt was not good, and that it was a waste of money. I really was foolish and Internxt did an evil bait and switch. Do not give Internxt your money! pcloud, icecloud, koofr are all much more qualified companies"},

However this is more of a hack. rsync is more a syrnconisation tool than a dedicated network transfer tool. So while it works great, it has issues resulting from frequent dropouts. It works okay but I'm after something more robust that can withtstand network dropouts. To complicate matters, the NAS is running (ReFS)[ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ReFS] , the machines which generate the data run window10, others run weird Centos DE and finally the last one is ubuntu.

I did my research and narrowed it down to Synology 923+ to start my data hoarding journey however I recently came across a PC built to use as NAS. Now, because of this, I am a bit confused as to which one should I go for since the PC helps me save a lot of money. However, I am not that knowledgeable when it comes to using NAS via TrueNAS, maintaining my NAS-related PC setup etc. I have used a Windows PC Tower (with monitor) in the past but I only used it for 7 years (without any major issues) and changed to a laptop. It will be really helpful to know if the PC setup given below is a good choice for its price, good for my use case and if it will consume too much power as a NAS or not. This person is looking for $240 (probably can give the system to me for $220).

Preferably some external solution, a power cable, and a USB A output so it would be easy to plug into my media box For now, I've been using a few USB thumb drives, which did the job. They were slow to transfer too and one of them died (tho it was easy to get it replaced via the manufacturer). So I'm basically thinking about some smaller ssd, nvme setup (2tb each drive), but I'm having a hard time finding one that isn't just a single ssd or single nvme enclosure. External hard drives also didn't sound so bad. Still, if I wanted a bigger capacity I would be stuck with Seagate One Touch Hubs and the question of how long will it last. In contrast, external SSDs seemed bad since they cost like 100 euros per 1tb while a decent 2tb nvme costs around 120 euros (150 euros if where count the enclosure)."},

I have a new mini PC and I had hoped to move these into a NAS and access them as is, no reformatting, no RAID - although I may buy another drive and drop it in a 4-bay solution and mirror to that, I have no need or desire for reformatting these drives currently, nor to move to a RAID solution. All the NAS units I look at say I have to reformat my drives first. I can't just plug them in and use them. It's a shame as my really old 2-bay Buffalo NAS allowed just that. DAS drives look attractive, but mixing an SSD with HDDs seems harder there and I haven't found one to suit. Any thoughts or solutions for the above?

{"Title": "Optimal external drive distribution?", "Author": "u/CautiousXperimentor", "Content": "Hello. Historically, I’ve had the following USB spinning hard drives (all 2.5”): - WD My Passport: 1 TB: personal stuff and old files, as this was my first external drive; this includes photos, videos, class recordings, old images and screenshots, music, software from the 90s and early 2000… stuff that I don’t want to get rid of. It’s at 80% full. - Toshiba Canvio Basics (1TB): Movie backups, classified by genre, and game backups. 96% capacity. - Toshiba Canvio Basics (yes, I love how good and reliable this model is) (2TB): Series, documentaries and anime backups, as well as other content from the internet such as podcasts or video-podcasts. It’s at 60% of its capacity. - Re-used Hitachi drive (256GB): it’s health is low, but it still works, I use it as the only ExFAT drive if I need to use it on a machine that doesn’t support my current files system (APFS). It has a lot of random stuff. Now, those are the traditional spinning external drives I’ve always had. On the other hand, during the recent years, thanks to different sales, I’ve managed to get the following Samsung T5 and T7 SSDs. My plan when I got this new T5 and T7 Samsung SSDs was to be able to carry with me the same information but with much less weight, and keep the older 2.5” hard drives as a long term storage/backup, without actually using them unless when I want to back up something very important. My new portable SSDs are the following: -T5 500GB: I intend to use it to carry it with me to the university, store class recordings (including video) that usually take 1GB each, and my device has only 128GB on board. I want to use it as a high performance pen-drive. -T5 1TB: here, I’d thought to store the same personal data, such as photos or videos or old files that I already have on my WD My Passport (1TB) - T7 2TB: intended to use as a media SSD, because of it’s big size. However, I’m not sure if I should use it to store my academical recordings (remember, ~1GB per file), or just put there my favorite movie and series backups. Or maybe both? But having already 1TB 2.5” HDD just for movies, and another 2TB 2.5” HDD for series+anime backups and other Internet video content such as videopodcasts, I’m not sure if putting here my favorite content (duplicate) is wasting this 2TB SSD. -T7 Shield 4TB: And when I thought I had enough SSDs to fulfill my needs… I saw a sale on the T7 Shield 4TB SSD, at less than half the price. Obviously, I had to get it. So now I have this 4TB SSD that I can carry with me with EVERYTHING I have on the other SSDs, in just one drive. However, when I go to the Uni, the SSD I want to carry with me is the T5 500GB. It’s the cheapest and everything on it will -hopefully- be backed up. My main doubt is (option A) wether to use the T5 1TB SSD for personal stuff that I already have on the WD My PassPort, but that’s not data I use too much. In this case I would use the 2TB SSD for my classes (long term) AND my favorite media content such as movies and shows. The alternative (option B) is to use the T5 1TB for storing my classes long term (short term is what the 500GB is for), and leave the 2TB SSD just for non-personal media. In this case (option B), among the personal data from the WD drive, I could make a selection, i.e. all my personal photos and memories and PDFs and documents, and put them on the 4TB drive along with the media stuff and my uni stuff to have everything in one drive. I could also use this 4TB SSD to sort all the duplicates I have on every hard drive, which I suspect they are a lot. I think it’s easier having all in one drive. Don’t worry about privacy, as I’m formatting all the T5 and T7 with encryption and a 16-20 character long password, a different one for each drive. How would you use the 4 SSDs if you were me? You can also comment on my hardware if you want. The Toshiba Canvio Basic were cheap and extraordinarily reliable and silent hard drives that still work perfectly after more than 10 years."},

It connects via USBC) that I saw on sale along with 4 24TB Seagate drives. My idea was to then use Windows Storage Spaces to create a pool and mirror the drives to add redundancy. But then I saw a lot of people on here really don't like Storage Spaces which sent me down a rabbit hole of Googling and reading threads which involved a million acronyms and other words and names I don't understand and now I'm thoroughly confused. Like what's the difference between a DAS and a JBOD? What's a Home Lab? What's ZFS? (I'm just asking these to show the kind of research mess I've ended up in, don't feel the need to spend paragraphs answering them.) Is Storage Spaces good enough for what I want? Will it easily allow me to add more drives to the pool down the line? Did I buy the wrong thing? Should I have done something else?"},

Preferably some external solution, a power cable, and a USB A output so it would be easy to plug into my media box For now, I've been using a few USB thumb drives, which did the job. They were slow to transfer too and one of them died (tho it was easy to get it replaced via the manufacturer). So I'm basically thinking about some smaller ssd, nvme setup (2tb each drive), but I'm having a hard time finding one that isn't just a single ssd or single nvme enclosure. External hard drives also didn't sound so bad. Still, if I wanted a bigger capacity I would be stuck with Seagate One Touch Hubs and the question of how long will it last. In contrast, external SSDs seemed bad since they cost like 100 euros per 1tb while a decent 2tb nvme costs around 120 euros (150 euros if where count the enclosure)."},

I've been researching and asking questions regarding NAS drives, and I thought I'd chosen a NAS to purchase. Then, just before I buy, I see that it formats the drives you're installing and there's no way round it, something I can't do. I have an 512Gb SSD and two 1TB HDDs filled with data in my old PC. I have a new mini PC and I had hoped to move these into a NAS and access them as is, no reformatting, no RAID - although I may buy another drive and drop it in a 4-bay solution and mirror to that, I have no need or desire for reformatting these drives currently, nor to move to a RAID solution. All the NAS units I look at say I have to reformat my drives first. I can't just plug them in and use them. It's a shame as my really old 2-bay Buffalo NAS allowed just that. DAS drives look attractive, but mixing an SSD with HDDs seems harder there and I haven't found one to suit. Any thoughts or solutions for the above? Am I missing a NAS that could mix these drives and not require me to reformat? Is there a DAS that would allow SSD and HDD together?

{"Title": "Optimal external drive distribution?", "Author": "u/CautiousXperimentor", "Content": "Hello. Historically, I’ve had the following USB spinning hard drives (all 2.5”): - WD My Passport: 1 TB: personal stuff and old files, as this was my first external drive; this includes photos, videos, class recordings, old images and screenshots, music, software from the 90s and early 2000… stuff that I don’t want to get rid of. It’s at 80% full. - Toshiba Canvio Basics (1TB): Movie backups, classified by genre, and game backups. 96% capacity. - Toshiba Canvio Basics (yes, I love how good and reliable this model is) (2TB): Series, documentaries and anime backups, as well as other content from the internet such as podcasts or video-podcasts. It’s at 60% of its capacity. - Re-used Hitachi drive (256GB): it’s health is low, but it still works, I use it as the only ExFAT drive if I need to use it on a machine that doesn’t support my current files system (APFS). It has a lot of random stuff. Now, those are the traditional spinning external drives I’ve always had. On the other hand, during the recent years, thanks to different sales, I’ve managed to get the following Samsung T5 and T7 SSDs. My plan when I got this new T5 and T7 Samsung SSDs was to be able to carry with me the same information but with much less weight, and keep the older 2.5” hard drives as a long term storage/backup, without actually using them unless when I want to back up something very important. My new portable SSDs are the following: -T5 500GB: I intend to use it to carry it with me to the university, store class recordings (including video) that usually take 1GB each, and my device has only 128GB on board. I want to use it as a high performance pen-drive. -T5 1TB: here, I’d thought to store the same personal data, such as photos or videos or old files that I already have on my WD My Passport (1TB) - T7 2TB: intended to use as a media SSD, because of it’s big size. However, I’m not sure if I should use it to store my academical recordings (remember, ~1GB per file), or just put there my favorite movie and series backups. Or maybe both? But having already 1TB 2.5” HDD just for movies, and another 2TB 2.5” HDD for series+anime backups and other Internet video content such as videopodcasts, I’m not sure if putting here my favorite content (duplicate) is wasting this 2TB SSD. -T7 Shield 4TB: And when I thought I had enough SSDs to fulfill my needs… I saw a sale on the T7 Shield 4TB SSD, at less than half the price. Obviously, I had to get it. So now I have this 4TB SSD that I can carry with me with EVERYTHING I have on the other SSDs, in just one drive. However, when I go to the Uni, the SSD I want to carry with me is the T5 500GB. It’s the cheapest and everything on it will -hopefully- be backed up. My main doubt is (option A) wether to use the T5 1TB SSD for personal stuff that I already have on the WD My PassPort, but that’s not data I use too much. In this case I would use the 2TB SSD for my classes (long term) AND my favorite media content such as movies and shows. The alternative (option B) is to use the T5 1TB for storing my classes long term (short term is what the 500GB is for), and leave the 2TB SSD just for non-personal media. In this case (option B), among the personal data from the WD drive, I could make a selection, i.e. all my personal photos and memories and PDFs and documents, and put them on the 4TB drive along with the media stuff and my uni stuff to have everything in one drive. I could also use this 4TB SSD to sort all the duplicates I have on every hard drive, which I suspect they are a lot. I think it’s easier having all in one drive. Don’t worry about privacy, as I’m formatting all the T5 and T7 with encryption and a 16-20 character long password, a different one for each drive. How would you use the 4 SSDs if you were me? You can also comment on my hardware if you want. The Toshiba Canvio Basic were cheap and extraordinarily reliable and silent hard drives that still work perfectly after more than 10 years."},

For years I have also used online backup. I've used IDrive in recent years (I've seen some complaints here, but I've found it to be fine, if a bit clunky) and Carbonite before that. But with my IDrive renewal coming up, I have wondered if having both Google Drive and IDrive are redundant. Years ago, I recall reading that online backup was still necessary because cloud storage wasn't reliable. But it seems like cloud storage has come a long way in terms of reliability and features, like file versioning and retrieval in case of loss.

So I am looking to Seagate to see if you offer 14+TB drives that do not have regular PWL thump sounds. I dont care about access noise nor motor whirr noise but PWL every 5 secs is like Chinese Water Torture! The ONLY issue is regular Pre-emptive Wear Levelling noises - and NOT access or drive noise Seagate Agent: Upon checking with the concern technical team, our technical team requested to inform you that, you will get a minimum sound with a lite vibration in our drives. As this sound will occur in all the hard drives, It will not be unusual like WD and this sound will not be disturbing to you. Other than that you can buy any Seagate drives according to the capacity and usage. PWL sounds will not occur in Seagate. But you can hear some minimum sort of sound and vibration can be heard slightly when the drive is in a silent room. You need not worry, you will not face any PWL sound issue in Seagate. Me: Second question: what is the best large drive that copes with regular power cycles? In my usage, the drive will be attached to a USB external dock cabinet which powers down the drive after 20 mins of non-use. This will occur 20 times a day, Out of the SG range, what copes best? Seagate Agent: Upon checking, Seagate does not recommend to use the drives in the USB dock or using splitters or any other external connectors. We recommend and request you to use the drives directly to the host device."},

I thought the corruption might've been carried over, so I decided to alphabetically re download all the videos onto the 2 TB drive. Re downloading the videos going fine until I hit a bit of a snag. I'd gotten to the R and S part of the video title alphabet. After I pasted some video files onto the 2TB drive I noticed there was external corruption being caused. I know this because I tried to paste a rar of the pc version of neversoft's spider-man game onto the drive (It was the lightest game I could think of) and the archive ended up being corrupt. I can tell when it's a clean paste, because the rar will paste slowly and the green meter resembles a set of waves, but when it's a corrupted paste, it'll look more like a straight line. I took those files off the drive, re pasted the archive and the rar was just fine.

I started off with a Synology DS920+ in 2020, equipped it with 4x6 TB drives, and soon found myself upgrading to 4x10 TB drives as my media and container needs grew. I've been heavily using PLEX, SONARR, RADARR, among other containers, and it's been fantastic so far. However, I'm now planning to dive into 4K transcoding, enhance my setup with more RAM for network labs, and maybe even host a gaming server. The demand on my current system is skyrocketing, and once again, I'm running out of space. I'm contemplating building a custom PC since the price seems comparable to getting an 8-bay Synology unit, but I'm really hung up on finding the right case. I'd prefer something that isn't a tower due to space constraints and aesthetics, but most importantly, I need it to support hot swapping. As my data hoarding isn't slowing down any time soon, I want to easily add more drives and replace any that fail without shutting down the system. Has anyone here tackled a similar upgrade or built their own high-capacity, hot-swappable storage system?

Did I make a mistake getting the WUH721816ALE6L1 not the ALE04 or is the drive from ServerPartDeals bad? The L1 is a \"self-encrypting drive\". It's supposed to be \"refurbished\" by WDC and has a new WDC label that says \"Recertified 12 NOV 2023\" and P/N 0F24861  FW:870. I previously bought two 14TB  WUH721414ALE604 drives from Amazon before I learned of ServerPartDeals.com here (thanks guys!). I ran Spinrite 6.1 Level 5 on both. Each took about almost a week to do. Level 5 checks every sector, recovers (if possible) unreadable data, inverts it, writes it, reads it, verifies it, then rewrites and re-verifies each sector. One of them was fine and the other had some bad sectors at the very end so I returned it. I was thinking I should have bought a 16TB one, so after returning the 14TB to Amazon, I bought the WUH721816ALE6L1 from ServerPartDeals on Friday and got it today, Monday. Free 2nd Day Air. Very cool! I especially liked that they say it's \"Manufacturer Recertified\". Spinrite can see the drive and reads it's configuration from the drive electronics. It knows it's 16TB and how many bytes and sectors it has. It tests every drive it can recognize to be sure it can read and write sectors on each drive. However when it tests the 16TB drive to verify it can read and write the drive's sectors, that fails. I've tried this on two different systems with the same result. I did a quick test in Linux trying to 'dd' another drive to it, but it complained it can't access the drive saying that maybe it is DRM'd. The same 'dd' command works just fine with the 14TB drive. Is there something I need to do to the drive to make it work or is it just bad and needs to be returned? My apologies if I should post this elsewhere.

I started off with a Synology DS920+ in 2020, equipped it with 4x6 TB drives, and soon found myself upgrading to 4x10 TB drives as my media and container needs grew. I've been heavily using PLEX, SONARR, RADARR, among other containers, and it's been fantastic so far. However, I'm now planning to dive into 4K transcoding, enhance my setup with more RAM for network labs, and maybe even host a gaming server. The demand on my current system is skyrocketing, and once again, I'm running out of space. I'm contemplating building a custom PC since the price seems comparable to getting an 8-bay Synology unit, but I'm really hung up on finding the right case. I'd prefer something that isn't a tower due to space constraints and aesthetics, but most importantly, I need it to support hot swapping. As my data hoarding isn't slowing down any time soon, I want to easily add more drives and replace any that fail without shutting down the system.

Did I make a mistake getting the WUH721816ALE6L1 not the ALE04 or is the drive from ServerPartDeals bad? The L1 is a \"self-encrypting drive\". It's supposed to be \"refurbished\" by WDC and has a new WDC label that says \"Recertified 12 NOV 2023\" and P/N 0F24861  FW:870. I previously bought two 14TB  WUH721414ALE604 drives from Amazon before I learned of ServerPartDeals.com here (thanks guys!). I ran Spinrite 6.1 Level 5 on both. Each took about almost a week to do. Level 5 checks every sector, recovers (if possible) unreadable data, inverts it, writes it, reads it, verifies it, then rewrites and re-verifies each sector. One of them was fine and the other had some bad sectors at the very end so I returned it. I was thinking I should have bought a 16TB one, so after returning the 14TB to Amazon, I bought the WUH721816ALE6L1 from ServerPartDeals on Friday and got it today, Monday. Free 2nd Day Air. Very cool! I especially liked that they say it's \"Manufacturer Recertified\". Spinrite can see the drive and reads it's configuration from the drive electronics. It knows it's 16TB and how many bytes and sectors it has. It tests every drive it can recognize to be sure it can read and write sectors on each drive. However when it tests the 16TB drive to verify it can read and write the drive's sectors, that fails. I've tried this on two different systems with the same result. I did a quick test in Linux trying to 'dd' another drive to it, but it complained it can't access the drive saying that maybe it is DRM'd. The same 'dd' command works just fine with the 14TB drive. Is there something I need to do to the drive to make it work or is it just bad and needs to be returned? My apologies if I should post this elsewhere.

However, this data is only touched at max 30 days per year. Currently, I manually turn on my archive NAS when need, run my test, move any new data to the archive, and power down the NAS manually. I am curious if there is any hardware or software that can do this automatically. I am thinking of something like a disk enclosure or disk shelf that contains an 'archive pool.' When I access the archive pool, the enclosure powers up, attaches the pool to the NAS, and works as normal. Then, after some delay, the pool detaches and powers down. This is more about power consumption than wear and tear. I currently average about ten years of life out of my drives. They start their lives as constantly spinning drives in my primary NAS, and then when I replace those drives with larger ones, they move to the archive NAS, which runs infrequently."},

I managed to pull the data off the drives and am currently running some tests on them to make sure there are no issues. (They are older drives, and quite small by today's standards). Thankfully, no data lost! I'm trying to figure out the best solution for myself going forward. Should I go NAS for storage and grab a mini-pc (N100 Beelink or similar) for the living room? Should I build a new HTPC/Server? (it would need to be somewhat cost effective) The main uses I need are: Sharing of media over our home network (in house only) I'd like to run a Jellyfin or Plex server to serve that media Data Storage (pictures, family movies, work projects) I'm not looking to share files remotely and there would be a max of 2 users accessing the data on our home network. Unfortunately, I wasn't able to salvage anything but the mechanical drives from the system. (MB was fried and video card was ancient). Supplies I already have but am not married to: Radeon 6800 XT (given from a friend's old system) 1TB NVME Drive - Western Digital Blue 3x 1TB Mechanical Drives - Western Digital Black -- Want to ditch these for something more robust 3TB Mechanical Drive - Western Digital Black -- Same as above Any thoughts/ideas would be greatly appreciated, as all my data is currently living on my current system and it's backed up on various external drives (not ideal).

They are not listed To those who wonder why the height is important, max 15mm height for 2.5\" drives has been the standard for may years and is the largest height allowed in 2.5\" enclosures. The 5TB MyPassport case is 19.2mm and the drive is 15mm. The 6TB is 20.6mm so the drive is probably 16 or 16.5mm to accommodate the additional platter.

I am a robotics engineer. I have a lot of old sensor data that is used very infrequently. Whenever we release a new release, we run a simulation against old data to ensure there are no regressions. However, this data is only touched at max 30 days per year. Currently, I manually turn on my archive NAS when need, run my test, move any new data to the archive, and power down the NAS manually. I am curious if there is any hardware or software that can do this automatically. I am thinking of something like a disk enclosure or disk shelf that contains an 'archive pool.' When I access the archive pool, the enclosure powers up, attaches the pool to the NAS, and works as normal. Then, after some delay, the pool detaches and powers down. This is more about power consumption than wear and tear. I currently average about ten years of life out of my drives. They start their lives as constantly spinning drives in my primary NAS, and then when I replace those drives with larger ones, they move to the archive NAS, which runs infrequently."},

I then had it write a 34GB file to tape and it took 528 seconds (not including tape rewind time) coming in at ~69.1/MBs which is still slow so I don't think the bottle neck is the SATA drives. The FC card is showing the link speed as 8Gbps and even if it was 1Gbps it's still too slow so I don't think it could be that. All that's left is the tape drive or Debian/drivers/software.

Basically, I currently have an  Apple 2021 M1 iMac with 1 TB of storage, and I would like to backup my data. I can buy a $65 2 TB Seagate HDD, a $20 enclosure, use time machine to backup my data, and this would be a good solution (right? I’m saying these things as I understand them, but please correct anything I say that’s not entirely accurate). However, I have an old 1 TB HDD from an old iMac, because I swapped the HDD for an SSD. I think it might be convenient to use this for my backups instead. However, I’m like 90% I need to wipe and reformat the drive first, because when I just plug it in, it doesn’t show up on Time Machine. I’ve looked at the drive, and it seems like pretty much all of the data on it is on my current computer. However, I don’t want to lose any files that might only be on the HDD, and while I’m like 90% certain that all the data on the HDD is also on my iMac, I’d like to make certain before wiping it. So, two questions here: What is the easiest way to check and see if all the data on the HDD is also on the SSD? Do I even need to do that? Should I just bite the bullet and get a new 2 TB HDD? The HDD doesn’t support SMART so I can’t see exactly how many total read/writes are on it, but I’m fairly certain it really isn’t that many, so that isn’t a big concern of mine. Newer drives like the ones I was looking at from Seagate support SMART, so I guess that might be better for monitoring the drive’s health. Also, I’m only using about 250 GB on my SSD right now, the 1 TB HDD is large enough for backups. I look forward to being enlightened by this community!"},

{"Title": "Downsized from 5TB to 100GB on OneDrive Edu - Seeking Storage Solutions on a Budget!", "Author": "u/cuong3101", "Content": "I’m in a bit of a pickle and could use your collective wisdom. My OneDrive Edu account, which was my digital haven with 5TB of space, has been abruptly downsized to a mere 100GB. This change came without warning, as I missed the memo about Microsoft scaling down storage for educational institutions. Here’s my current setup: Three 3.5 inch 1TB HDDs (one’s a dedicated movie library) A 500GB Samsung 860 Evo SSD A “2.5 / 3.5 inch 2 Bay USB3.0 1 to 1 Clone Hard Drive Dock” (sans RAID, so it’s just two separate drives) With my OneDrive now bursting at the seams with 1.3TB-1.5TB of data, I’m exploring storage alternatives that won’t break the bank. The NAS Synology DS220j or DS223j are within my financial reach, but they offer only two hard drive slots. There’s also an old family computer gathering dust back home, powered by an i5 (6th or 8th gen) and a 300W power supply of dubious origin. It’s been out of action for a while, and I’m not even sure it’s still operational. Reviving it would mean having it shipped over, which is a 4-5 day wait. So, dear Redditors, what’s my best move here? Should I invest in a budget NAS, attempt to resurrect the old PC, or is there another ingenious solution I haven’t considered? UPDATE: Thanks for everyone's comments, after a week has passed I update the current situation as follows. Temporarily : I have manually backed up all data on OneDrive to 2 1TB hard drives. My data is temporarily safe. Future : Maybe I will find a way to take advantage of the old computer at home to use up the remaining hard drives and have access to the data in the other two hard drives at all times. If that doesn't work, I'm thinking of buying Synology's DS423 NAS device. The best-case scenario is that I could have 2 separate devices (1 Synology NAS and 1 NAS from my old computer), put them in 2 separate places and hope to find a way to sync them. In the long run, I will look into some more cloud storage packages to back up data from the other 2 devices. So I can have 3 copies of data: 1 on my personal computer that can be accessed at all times, 1 on the NAS device and 1 on the cloud. Hopefully this way I won't have to worry about data being at risk of being lost in the future. UPDATE 2: I was wondering why everyone suggested a 6TB hard drive to me so much. Then I realized that my poor English writing made people misunderstand that I needed to back up 5TB of data from OneDrive instead of 1.5TB."},

I’m considering a few options and would love your input: Installing Proxmox on SSDs: Utilizing the SSDs for the OS to leverage their speed for the hypervisor. Using SAS drives as cache: Taking advantage of the 12Gbps speed for caching to enhance overall performance. Direct ZFS on Proxmox: Managing the drives directly in Proxmox with ZFS, but I’m concerned about losing functionalities like SMB sharing, permissions management, and user administration. I also have an old Synology RS2818RP+ that I could use: Synology NAS with 16 bays and 10GbE connectivity. Equipped with the E10M20-T1 (a 10Gig Network card with 2x 2TB NVMe SSDs for network cache). Considering moving all large HDDs to the Synology and using it as the main storage, and only hosting the VMs' main system on the Dell's SSDs (so each VM gets 32GB; the main storage is on the Synology). Direct 10GbE connection to the Dell R750 for high-speed access. (Block Access) Potential Solutions: Bare Metal TrueNAS Scale: Install TrueNAS directly on the server for maximum performance, but lose the flexibility of Proxmox. Proxmox with ZFS and Containers/VMs: Use Proxmox with ZFS for storage and handle additional services (SMB, permissions, Nextcloud) via LXC containers or VMs. Hybrid Approach: Keep Proxmox with ZFS pools, and run a VM for TrueNAS Scale to manage SMB and NFS, with other services running in containers/VMs on Proxmox. Leveraging Synology NAS: Use the Synology as the main storage system with 10GbE connectivity to the Dell R750. Utilize the NVMe SSD cache on the Synology for improved performance. Keep the SSDs and SAS drives in the Dell R750 for caching and high-speed storage needs. I’d love to hear your thoughts on these approaches or any other suggestions you might have. What would be the best way to balance performance, flexibility, and power efficiency in this setup? Thanks in advance for your help! I hope you all have a good weekend.

At the moment I have 1,3TB of photos and videos in a WD Blue 4TB, and I edit photos and videos with it. Therefore, I'm thinking of buying a SSD to backup my media, since I haven't had any problems with them (granted, I've only used them as main drives). Is the Crucial X6 (119 € 2TB) a good choice? It's on sale right now, but I've read that the cache depletes after having had 250GB written. After that, it writes at 40MBps, if I'm not mistaken. It is also QLC, which might affect longevity. Regarding the X9 (144€ 2TB), I can't find any review... I have bought the X9 pro (174€ 2TB) for my work, and it's very good, but it might be overkill for backups. A redditor, u/ JohnnieLouHansen said that if I didn't need the speed of an SSD and wanted reliability, to go with Western Digital Enterprise drives, gold.

Basically, I currently have an  Apple 2021 M1 iMac with 1 TB of storage, and I would like to backup my data. I can buy a $65 2 TB Seagate HDD, a $20 enclosure, use time machine to backup my data, and this would be a good solution (right? I’m saying these things as I understand them, but please correct anything I say that’s not entirely accurate). However, I have an old 1 TB HDD from an old iMac, because I swapped the HDD for an SSD. I think it might be convenient to use this for my backups instead. However, I’m like 90% I need to wipe and reformat the drive first, because when I just plug it in, it doesn’t show up on Time Machine. I’ve looked at the drive, and it seems like pretty much all of the data on it is on my current computer. However, I don’t want to lose any files that might only be on the HDD, and while I’m like 90% certain that all the data on the HDD is also on my iMac, I’d like to make certain before wiping it. So, two questions here: What is the easiest way to check and see if all the data on the HDD is also on the SSD? Do I even need to do that? Should I just bite the bullet and get a new 2 TB HDD? The HDD doesn’t support SMART so I can’t see exactly how many total read/writes are on it, but I’m fairly certain it really isn’t that many, so that isn’t a big concern of mine. Newer drives like the ones I was looking at from Seagate support SMART, so I guess that might be better for monitoring the drive’s health. Also, I’m only using about 250 GB on my SSD right now, the 1 TB HDD is large enough for backups. I look forward to being enlightened by this community!"},

{"Title": "Downsized from 5TB to 100GB on OneDrive Edu - Seeking Storage Solutions on a Budget!", "Author": "u/cuong3101", "Content": "I’m in a bit of a pickle and could use your collective wisdom. My OneDrive Edu account, which was my digital haven with 5TB of space, has been abruptly downsized to a mere 100GB. This change came without warning, as I missed the memo about Microsoft scaling down storage for educational institutions. Here’s my current setup: Three 3.5 inch 1TB HDDs (one’s a dedicated movie library) A 500GB Samsung 860 Evo SSD A “2.5 / 3.5 inch 2 Bay USB3.0 1 to 1 Clone Hard Drive Dock” (sans RAID, so it’s just two separate drives) With my OneDrive now bursting at the seams with 1.3TB-1.5TB of data, I’m exploring storage alternatives that won’t break the bank. The NAS Synology DS220j or DS223j are within my financial reach, but they offer only two hard drive slots. There’s also an old family computer gathering dust back home, powered by an i5 (6th or 8th gen) and a 300W power supply of dubious origin. It’s been out of action for a while, and I’m not even sure it’s still operational. Reviving it would mean having it shipped over, which is a 4-5 day wait. So, dear Redditors, what’s my best move here? Should I invest in a budget NAS, attempt to resurrect the old PC, or is there another ingenious solution I haven’t considered? UPDATE: Thanks for everyone's comments, after a week has passed I update the current situation as follows. Temporarily : I have manually backed up all data on OneDrive to 2 1TB hard drives. My data is temporarily safe. Future : Maybe I will find a way to take advantage of the old computer at home to use up the remaining hard drives and have access to the data in the other two hard drives at all times. If that doesn't work, I'm thinking of buying Synology's DS423 NAS device. The best-case scenario is that I could have 2 separate devices (1 Synology NAS and 1 NAS from my old computer), put them in 2 separate places and hope to find a way to sync them. In the long run, I will look into some more cloud storage packages to back up data from the other 2 devices. So I can have 3 copies of data: 1 on my personal computer that can be accessed at all times, 1 on the NAS device and 1 on the cloud. Hopefully this way I won't have to worry about data being at risk of being lost in the future. UPDATE 2: I was wondering why everyone suggested a 6TB hard drive to me so much. Then I realized that my poor English writing made people misunderstand that I needed to back up 5TB of data from OneDrive instead of 1.5TB."},

Here’s a quick overview of my current configuration: Server: Dell R750 Front: Twelve 3.5\" SATA/SAS bays Rear: Four 2.5\" SATA/SAS bays RAID Card: PERC 350H (supports RAID 1, 0, 10) (don’t worry, I use it in passthrough mode and it works so far, even on ZFS. Yes, I know that’s also a problem, and I plan to buy an HBA or use the RAID card for its intended purpose) 4x 10Gig SFP+ Networking via DAC SFP+ Moduels (For more info on that i have a post of my entire homelab on my Profile) Drives: Eight 4TB HDDs Two 3TB HDDs Two 2TB HDDs Two SAS 600GB HDDs Two 2TB SATA SSDs Current Setup: Proxmox as the hypervisor TrueNAS Scale as a VM with passthrough for ZFS I’m facing potential performance issues because TrueNAS Scale is virtualized. I’m considering a few options and would love your input: Installing Proxmox on SSDs: Utilizing the SSDs for the OS to leverage their speed for the hypervisor. Using SAS drives as cache: Taking advantage of the 12Gbps speed for caching to enhance overall performance. Direct ZFS on Proxmox: Managing the drives directly in Proxmox with ZFS, but I’m concerned about losing functionalities like SMB sharing, permissions management, and user administration. I also have an old Synology RS2818RP+ that I could use: Synology NAS with 16 bays and 10GbE connectivity. Equipped with the E10M20-T1 (a 10Gig Network card with 2x 2TB NVMe SSDs for network cache). Considering moving all large HDDs to the Synology and using it as the main storage, and only hosting the VMs' main system on the Dell's SSDs (so each VM gets 32GB; the main storage is on the Synology). Direct 10GbE connection to the Dell R750 for high-speed access. (Block Access) Potential Solutions: Bare Metal TrueNAS Scale: Install TrueNAS directly on the server for maximum performance, but lose the flexibility of Proxmox. Proxmox with ZFS and Containers/VMs: Use Proxmox with ZFS for storage and handle additional services (SMB, permissions, Nextcloud) via LXC containers or VMs. Hybrid Approach: Keep Proxmox with ZFS pools, and run a VM for TrueNAS Scale to manage SMB and NFS, with other services running in containers/VMs on Proxmox. Leveraging Synology NAS: Use the Synology as the main storage system with 10GbE connectivity to the Dell R750. Utilize the NVMe SSD cache on the Synology for improved performance. Keep the SSDs and SAS drives in the Dell R750 for caching and high-speed storage needs. I’d love to hear your thoughts on these approaches or any other suggestions you might have. What would be the best way to balance performance, flexibility, and power efficiency in this setup? Thanks in advance for your help! I hope you all have a good weekend.

However I remembered I pulled a few SAS HBA's out of it when I got it. They are Dell g164p 6GB/S HBA cards, apparently they are the same board as the more common H200E just with no internal headers, just external. I'm thinking I can use these instead of purchasing another card, but unsure how I would hook this up, as far as I can deduce I'll need to plug in a backplane somewhere in the rear for the SATA board and I'll have to route the cables from outside the chassis. The g164p cards have a type of sfp connector, assuming this is standard for connecting backplanes etc and buying a backplane off of eBay for R720XD will work with this? Related question, I would assume it's not possible to split the front drive bays so some are served with different controllers? If not then I'd have to mount new drives for the HBA controller in the rear somewhere, there does look established slots there already, 2.5\"."},
{"Title": "Advice on building a DAS", "Author": "u/the_mcm", "Content": "I’m about to head off to college and want to have a single place for storage with some redundancy. I know it’d be best to have some sort of offisite backup, but I don’t really have the money for that right now judging by the amount of files I need to store. I’d mostly be storing a lot of video projects (abt 6tb+ currently), hoping to also do some editing off of the DAS, along with playing and storing a decent bit of dvd/blu ray rips (abt 2+ tb and growing). I’d also probably have a decent but more of other miscellaneous music, videos, etc to store. Doing some limited research I saw good things about the OWC Mercury quad paired with OWC’s SoftRaid to do a RAID5 set up. Pricing things out, it seems like I could get 4 WD Red 8tb HDDs along with the OWC enclosure for right around my budget of about $1k, and would give me 24tb usable space. Does this seem like a reasonable set up for my needs, and would RAID5 be good if I’ll be writing and reading from the DAS often? Thanks."},
{"Title": "Will storing large files in a NAS wear out hard drives faster?", "Author": "u/Hostile_18", "Content": "Hi all. New to all this. Got my media NAS and am trying to decide between good x254 encodes at around 1.2-2.2gb or full 1080p remux episodes at around 7-12gb. My question is will the quality difference be worth it, and also will it significantly reduce the hard drives lifespan? I've got 6x 20tb Exos drives that have a work load of 550tb a year for 5 years, I guess half that if you run parity once a month. All this and that's not even counting huge 4k remux files. The X-files 1080p remux from the Blu-Ray discs is like 2tb alone. What's anyone elses experience hosting large media files? Have the hard drives held up over time?

I want to consolidate decades of data from different sources and put it all together on a DAS (or similar) that can plug into a 2018 MacBook Pro (with USB-C). I’m going with DAS-to-computer setup because I intend to use Backblaze to keep the whole thing backed up to the cloud for low-cost (directly connected drives are included in their unlimited backup and only need to be plugged in once a year to stay backed up). Ideally, I’d like around 10 TB, but I’m unsure how to get there. I was hoping to use SSD drives or M.2 in some kind of enclosure but they may be too expensive. It sounds like software RAID is better, but I’m unsure how to get that going on a Mac, and I’m not sure which enclosure/drives to get. Oh yes, and the main consideration is cost - I need to do this on the cheap, even if it's a little improvised or rough around the edges. I don’t need screaming speed, but I do want to move and access many photos and videos without having to wait. If 2 or 3 large and slow SATA drives on a particular RAID setup gets me good enough performance through USB-3 or Thunderbolt, that’s also fine. There are so many options, and I’m a little bamboozled.

Since most of the games are shareware (demo), I think most people like me could only play the demo version of Super Angelo, limited to 3 levels only, since the shareware version is the easiest to find. The complete version has way more levels and the final ending. The Flash version of Super Angelo is also complete. Some of the games can't be be purchased anymore and remain in their demo version like Olaf & Elmar In the Castle of Nabokos. Some of the games include their user's manual, level maps (Super Worms) or source code (Mario & Luigi and Mario!!!).

{"Title": "Re-formatting SMR HDD as NTFS, or just keeping as exFAT?", "Author": "u/Caesar_35", "Content": "So, all of my previous drives have been your run-of-the-mill 2.5\" portables, all pre-formatted NTFS. I only use them for backup purposes, so phone pictures, game screenshots, some files, etc, which I manually copy across to two drives (muh redundancy). Lots of small files basically. My dutiful 2TB drive's recently gotten the dreaded red line of \"your space's running out\", and I saw a good deal on an 8TB 3.5\" external so jumped on it. However, it comes pre-formatted exFAT, which I'm aware isn't as well regarded as NTFS. I've only ever seen them on flashdrives myself. It's also an SMR drive (spooky, I know), so I'm not sure if NTFS or exFAT makes a difference there. Basically my question is, is it really worth while re-formatting to NTFS, or can I just keep it exFAT? This is going to be the backup drive of my backup drive, but I'd still rather it not get corrupted or have any other issues down the line. I'd also rather not unnecessarily spend time re-formatting it if there's not much reason to. I mean, I figure it should be fine since that's how it came out the box, but better safe than sorry. It's one of those newer-era Seagate Expansions with the diagonal lines, if that makes any difference. And lastly, if I do go the route of re-formatting, would a quick format be fine given it's never been used for anything? And any guidelines for allocation unit size, being an SMR drive (is smaller/larger size better)? Thanks all!"},

When I was showing my archived photos to my family in the Synology photos app, my grandma asked if I could digitize her thousands upon thousands of photos. Then she spread the word to her emblem club and elks lodge friends that I was doing it for her and now a half dozen of her friends want me to do theirs too. They offered to pay me for the service. I was looking at scanners, and it seems like consumer grade scanners are a hit and miss. They are either too slow, or the ones that are fast leave marks on the originals. I tried looking up commercial grade scanners but I'm not able to find anything. I'm sure they're expensive, but I've been wanting to start a side business for my wife, so that she can quit her current job and be at home with the kids more. So I'm willing to invest in a good quality machine if the market is there."}
