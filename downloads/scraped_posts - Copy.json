For the cost of a DVD or two a month you can access a \"channel\" with thousands of movies/TV with one click. This sub is a bubble unfortunately.\nOnly one person in my friend group uses physical media and everyone else tossed their DVD/Blu-ray players for a streaming box years ago.\nEvery thrift store I visit in my area has 5+ Blu-ray players on the shelf and HUGE piles of discs.

Could I fuck..\nYou see they implemented a DRM that required a specific instruction set, that was intel only, after a certain generation...\nSo, my desktop AMD (as remember, these came out as AMD started to really take the market from Intel) was out, my old spare desktop was also out as that was AMD too.\nMy $6k mobile workstation, the i7 was too old, my HTPC (which let's face it would've been the ideal machine for it) the i5 in it was too old.\nPartners laptop was out, my two spare laptops didn't cut it.\nMy NAS, put of all the machines in the house, the single one I'd built to not have a screen attached had a piddly i3 that was new enough to play 4k Blu-ray's.\nSo, extra long hdmi cable purchased I run it around to my 100\" 4k tri-lazer projector and...it's a piece of shit.\nThe 4k scan is terrible and just wall to wall iso noise, the 4k Blu-ray of Die Hard looks worse than the 25th anniversary copy I already had, feck, it's worse than watching the DVD through the projectors auto upscaling..\nThe one I'd won, Alien, great movie, great copy, but I was done. If spent a fair bit of money to buy a player and this, this killed buying media for me. \nI had a huge dvd/hd dvd/Blu-ray collection before I emigrated (had left at my old man's, who casually mentioned he just took it to the tip six months later, twat) and had started to rebuild a good collection since getting here.\nBig movie fan and big believer in buying the films, I've run movie clubs, regularly go opening night/weekend to the movies (just saw A Quite Place:Day One yesterday), always had the biggest collection of anyone I know (and when you rub movie clubs you get to know some real buffs).\nPrime target audience, but I was done, left with a foul taste in my mouth that I couldn't watch my legally paid for media on my legally paid for drive simply because some greedy asshole decided the DRM they wanted, which was quickly cracked, just like every other, would be so burdensome to the actual end user.\nIt literally became the \"stolen\" version was a better product. I could watch that on any device in my house, or out with my nebula capsule, just conveniently steamed from Plex without any of the hoops to jump through or unskippable \"you wouldn't shit in a policeman's hat\" antipiracy or forced trailers (for movies not even tangentially related to the one on the disc) before the content I wanted to watch.\nFuck 'em, good riddance.",

Could I fuck..\nYou see they implemented a DRM that required a specific instruction set, that was intel only, after a certain generation...\nSo, my desktop AMD (as remember, these came out as AMD started to really take the market from Intel) was out, my old spare desktop was also out as that was AMD too.\nMy $6k mobile workstation, the i7 was too old, my HTPC (which let's face it would've been the ideal machine for it) the i5 in it was too old.\nPartners laptop was out, my two spare laptops didn't cut it.\nMy NAS, put of all the machines in the house, the single one I'd built to not have a screen attached had a piddly i3 that was new enough to play 4k Blu-ray's.\nSo, extra long hdmi cable purchased I run it around to my 100\" 4k tri-lazer projector and...it's a piece of shit.\nThe 4k scan is terrible and just wall to wall iso noise, the 4k Blu-ray of Die Hard looks worse than the 25th anniversary copy I already had, feck, it's worse than watching the DVD through the projectors auto upscaling..\nThe one I'd won, Alien, great movie, great copy, but I was done. If spent a fair bit of money to buy a player and this, this killed buying media for me. \nI had a huge dvd/hd dvd/Blu-ray collection before I emigrated (had left at my old man's, who casually mentioned he just took it to the tip six months later, twat) and had started to rebuild a good collection since getting here.\nBig movie fan and big believer in buying the films, I've run movie clubs, regularly go opening night/weekend to the movies (just saw A Quite Place:Day One yesterday), always had the biggest collection of anyone I know (and when you rub movie clubs you get to know some real buffs).\nPrime target audience, but I was done, left with a foul taste in my mouth that I couldn't watch my legally paid for media on my legally paid for drive simply because some greedy asshole decided the DRM they wanted, which was quickly cracked, just like every other, would be so burdensome to the actual end user.\nIt literally became the \"stolen\" version was a better product. I could watch that on any device in my house, or out with my nebula capsule, just conveniently steamed from Plex without any of the hoops to jump through or unskippable \"you wouldn't shit in a policeman's hat\" antipiracy or forced trailers (for movies not even tangentially related to the one on the disc) before the content I wanted to watch.\nFuck 'em, good riddance.",

Could I fuck..\nYou see they implemented a DRM that required a specific instruction set, that was intel only, after a certain generation...\nSo, my desktop AMD (as remember, these came out as AMD started to really take the market from Intel) was out, my old spare desktop was also out as that was AMD too.\nMy $6k mobile workstation, the i7 was too old, my HTPC (which let's face it would've been the ideal machine for it) the i5 in it was too old.\nPartners laptop was out, my two spare laptops didn't cut it.\nMy NAS, put of all the machines in the house, the single one I'd built to not have a screen attached had a piddly i3 that was new enough to play 4k Blu-ray's.\nSo, extra long hdmi cable purchased I run it around to my 100\" 4k tri-lazer projector and...it's a piece of shit.\nThe 4k scan is terrible and just wall to wall iso noise, the 4k Blu-ray of Die Hard looks worse than the 25th anniversary copy I already had, feck, it's worse than watching the DVD through the projectors auto upscaling..\nThe one I'd won, Alien, great movie, great copy, but I was done. If spent a fair bit of money to buy a player and this, this killed buying media for me. \nI had a huge dvd/hd dvd/Blu-ray collection before I emigrated (had left at my old man's, who casually mentioned he just took it to the tip six months later, twat) and had started to rebuild a good collection since getting here.\nBig movie fan and big believer in buying the films, I've run movie clubs, regularly go opening night/weekend to the movies (just saw A Quite Place:Day One yesterday), always had the biggest collection of anyone I know (and when you rub movie clubs you get to know some real buffs).\nPrime target audience, but I was done, left with a foul taste in my mouth that I couldn't watch my legally paid for media on my legally paid for drive simply because some greedy asshole decided the DRM they wanted, which was quickly cracked, just like every other, would be so burdensome to the actual end user.\nIt literally became the \"stolen\" version was a better product. I could watch that on any device in my house, or out with my nebula capsule, just conveniently steamed from Plex without any of the hoops to jump through or unskippable \"you wouldn't shit in a policeman's hat\" antipiracy or forced trailers (for movies not even tangentially related to the one on the disc) before the content I wanted to watch.\nFuck 'em, good riddance.",

Not all that easy but still rather cheap. Then you have to build a prototype in a lab. This can be pretty tricky, but as long as your idea is sound, you likely can just throw a bit of money around and make it work. And you can get away creating something mostly impractical and just scale up your numbers etc. At this point, media will often write some pretty fantastical articles how this breakthrough will change the world.\nHowever, the most important, difficult and often very expensive step is the last: Devising a production method, material, and supply line that can transforms the idea into a cheap, mass producible and end user friendly product. And here tons of ideas break apart. Making the protype out of pure gold might be fine, but for the end product you have to make it work with a gold coating. Scratch that, to stay competitive you have to make it out of copper. And that special centrifuge you used to create this gel you use? You either have to find a way to make this using a normal mixing plant, or somehow find someone willing to invest like a billion dollars into developing a much larger version of that centrifuge. Oh, and you have to make the product much more sturdy, otherwise consumers will break it all the time. And no, you cannot make people take a 3 week course just to learn how to handle your product. You have to make it idiotproof. All while keeping costs low.\nTLDR: Until you can buy it for a reasonable price, just ignore videos like this.",

You also can't add/remove drives without the unit resetting, so keep that in mind.\nThe drives WILL fall out or at least disconnect by force of their own weight if the unit is sufficiently tipped or jarred even if the magnetic cover is attached and because that'll reset the whole unit there's significant chance of data loss/corruption. If there's any chance of tipping or getting bumped, move it somewhere safer or tape or strap the front cover into place.\nRE: the drive height gap (sorry, misinterpreted your post initially)\nYou could shim them with something but there's actually no solid barrier on the inside between drives so be careful not to break the thin plastic strips that separate the slots. Maybe look at attaching your shim pieces to the front cover or just between the drives themselves, rather than sticking them between the drive and slot separators.\nAlso highly recommended only using the unit in the position it's meant to be (horizontal) otherwise you run the risk of the SATA backplane connection getting fiddly over time from stress, heat, and vibration.",
