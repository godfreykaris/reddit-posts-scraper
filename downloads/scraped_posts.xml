He gifted them to me a while back because, while he wouldn't admit it, his eyes are starting to go, and he couldn't enjoy them anymore. With the tablet he can zoom in as far as needed so I know he would love to revisit the comics once they are in digital form. Everything is in pristine condition with sleeves and backers, but there is nothing insanely valuable in the collection. He has a couple that are worth something, but most sit at &amp;gt;$10. That said, it would crush him if any were damaged so the scanning method must be non-destructive.      What I have tried:  Czur Aura Pro    Super quick, but random cropping and glare for days, even using the side lights. I tried using it with the official light box, outside the box, with 1-5 additional lights, with only external lights at every angle known to man, in a diffusion light box, with polarizers, etc. The only thing that worked 100% of the time was scanning while sitting on my back porch on an overcast day. I opened a ticket with their support and the response was "Make your room light bright enough, but do not have direct light shining on the book.". They didn't address the cropping issues.  Epson Perfection V600Epson Scan - Impressive for OEM software but inconsistent and changing the framing is a pain unless things are at perfect right angles.  VueScan - Sometimes it decides just not to scan, sometimes it scans and the image is black. When it does scan it does fine, but the auto skew is ~90% accurate which may as well be 0 because I have to adjust every single picture.  Silverfast - I was surprised at how much better the scans look, but the scans take 2-3 times as long as the Vue or Epson software. Also I have to take a prescan every time I move the page?      At this point I'm ready to hire a service if anyone has any suggestions, but I would really prefer to do the scanning myself because I plan on at least completing the series that he has, and probably expanding on them. I do have an R10 and an M50, so I could try some sort of diybookscanner.com solution, but that is a lot of effort for something that may or may not have different results.</Content></post><post><Title>NAS build...

I managed to get my first backup for storage (tight on budget and stuff, and quite specific usecase where CD/DVD dominated HDDs, anyway) and I can't find one opinion about making it copied between two. No it's just cold storage drive I use when I need to access specific stuff, but mostly add to it, so there's no need to make sync after I will make copy of it (I'll just be adding on two different drives same stuff from another storage)..      What I found is.. It's reccomended to use software focused on that area of file operations. There are decent open source or free tools.. I have dilemmah wich of these I should use, but maybe there's some hidden gem you could recommend? Rsync - focused with good opinion, but commands line and no idea about speed FreeFileSync - GUI, rest as above did - I know that guy, I know it's missing a bit in speed but is quite tidy and could backup everything from one to another, right?      It's just rookie thing, about 4 or 5 Tb and 2 external drives connected via USB 2.0 (probably, tho drives use 3.0, but not device I want to use for it).. And I wonder what way will be best to make copy in less than few days 😅 sorry for language flops, I'm kinda messed recent days</Content></post><post><Title>Seeking advice regarding large storage options whether internal or external</Title><Author>u/__Y8__</Author><Content>I somewhat recently built a PC with one 2TB SSD (Samsung 980 Pro).

HW or SW?</Title><Author>u/trapexit</Author><Content>After just having a drive failure (of course it happened while transferring data to a new drive) I was wondering if there was any tooling around that perhaps data recovery folks leveraged to help diagnose issues. I've got two drives right now (8TB Seagate Archive drives) that died suddenly. One seems like it could be a bad logic board and I do have another with not just the same general board but the same batch? (same qr code) but haven't transferred the ROM between the boards to see if that will address it. The other (the one that died today while trying to transfer data to a new drive) will spin up but then makes a sound like the heads are seeking twice and then spins down. As I understand that's likely a hardware problem and not as home fixable.      While the data one these drives aren't critical it would be nice to be able to better diagnose the problems to see if it is worth the hassle to try to recover them.</Content></post><post><Title>Can you not download age restricted videos on mp3juices!</Title><Author>u/MichaelAftonXFireWal</Author><Content>So I use mp3juices to download my videos and I've been trying to download an age restricted video but every time it keeps saying error so I was wondering does that mean I can't download age restricted videos off of mp3juices?</Content></post><post><Title>Is EaseUS Partition Surface Test Reliable?</Title><Author>u/chineke14</Author><Content>Just wanted to see if anyone has experience with using Easeus for surface test?

I have a few that have died/stopped working? and don't know what to do now.      I have a Mac by the way, and an Windows 11 NUC running MacDrive, I have connected the drive to both, and have had nothing at all.      Edit: when I connect it, I can feel it running when I touch it, but it doesn’t mount at all, I can’t backup anything because I can’t see anything when it is connected.</Content></post><post><Title>Any advice on LTO-6 drive models (2nd hand on eBay) to look out for?</Title><Author>u/freshairproject</Author><Content>Which LTO6 drives do people usually recommend for Windows 11?

As I work on developing a robust backup strategy for my NAS, I wonder if QNAP offers a native solution that allows splitting backups across multiple external drives automatically, without manually dividing my directories into chunks of 4 TB each.      The rationale is that a 24 TB backup cannot fit on a single 4 TB external HDD. This becomes even more apparent if I expand to a usable 144 TB in the future. In that case, it would be impossible to find a single 144 TB external drive, as such drives simply do not exist.      So, is it possible to distribute backups across multiple external drives using QuTS hero 5? How exactly?</Content></post><post><Title>New Exos X14: HSMR or HM-SMR?</Title><Author>u/SirLouen</Author><Content>I've found this drive Exos X14 model ST10000NM0568      Here is the data sheethttps://www.seagate.com/www-content/datasheets/pdfs/exos-x-14-channel-DS1974-5-1912GB-en_AU.pdf    In the photo i can clearly read that HSMR       But I can't seem to figure out which kind of disk are we talking about.

However, having only one backup copy of my shit is not a recipe for success. Having one is as good as having none as I like to say, redundancy is crucial when it comes to hoarding my data. Important pictures are backed up, the most important of which are printed out.      My consideration here is whether or not I get a high capacity internal HDD @ 7200 RPM or if I buy a high capacity portable HDD that can take abuse and is less likely to be damaged by physical adjustments and movements. This is rarely a concern in my day to day but I live in an earthquake prone area and I would agonise over losing everything to some shaking dirt.      I can't do both due to financial constraints at the moment but the decision is as follows;      Do I get a second external USB HDD that will be slower and have inferior transfer rates BUT be more protected in event of disaster and any other events that may happen (dog with zoomies for instance.)      or      Do I get a more efficient and practical internal HDD (I imagine its also cheaper) that I suspect to be significantly more fragile and susceptible to sudden movements and will likely be lost in the aforementioned events.      If the internal is selected, should I acquire this before the sale ends? If I should go with an external what should I acquire? I'd like something larger than my current 5TB. I haven't used more than 1.1TB on it but I'd rather kick the can of running out of space a few more years down the road.</Content></post><post><Title>Honey, I Shrunk My Server</Title><Author>u/sylinen</Author><Content>No content</Content></post><post><Title>LSI 9207-8i setup</Title><Author>u/Mooman5</Author><Content>Hey everyone I’m currently trying to get the LSI 9207-8i to work in my home unraid server.

I am still a little baby hoarder with only about 15-20TB of data floating around my noisy 10 year old desktop-turned-HTPC. I was looking to expand to ~30TB (with room to grow of course) for a couple of initiatives and initially had been set on a rack and rackmount server or NAS chassis with a bunch of 3.5" bays for price-efficient spinning drives.      The cost though! Racks = $$$ Rackmount Chassis or pre-builts = $$$$!      Every penny I would save in drive capacity I would pay back in getting a nice (home-office) rack and NAS.      So I've come to you questioning a pivot point: What do you think about smaller solutions? Specifically I am thinking about a Mini-PC running unRAID connected to a JBOD enclosure for disks or large/cheap SSDs.      What's the performance difference between a setup like the above and a low-end rackmount setup (which is at the limit of what I could realistically afford)?

Located in India</Title><Author>u/The_Bipolar_Guy</Author><Content>Building my first DIY NAS. Need 2+2 tb to start off with. Trying to be as cheap as possible. Will be storing all memories and irreplaceable things. Will get an external HDD for offsite backup. Also, I do not care about read write speeds. I just want my data to be safe and backed up at the end of the day for as cheap as possible, I will add new data maybe once a month if not even more rarely. I will be using my old motherboard (6 SATA ports) and processor. Will get a new 500 GB ssd for OS and new RAM.      Now here is the dilemma. I am from India and WD Purples are selling for 5250 INR each, cheapest. Next up, WD Blue is also selling for 6000+ INR. I can technically afford (but want to avoid at all costs) to get a 10TB UltraStar or EXOS for 22000 INR but I need two physical drives at least and my total storage need for backup right now or even 3 years later will not exceed 4-5TB. so a 10TB HDD will be useless, not to mention spending 45K INR on drives only (which is VERY VERY EXPENSIVE FOR ME).      I know WD Purple glosses over write errors and can be bad. Chucking is equally expensive, if not more. Should I just get 2x 2tb WD Purple for 10.5K INR and set up my backup server for now. Will add more HDDs later as needed (1-4 years later). Can I do anything to prevent the write errors?      Also, if there is a cheaper way, especially in the long run, I would appreciate it. Currently I have ~2TB data which grows by like 200-400GB a year.

I've been living exclusively out of my backpack + carryon luggage for the last decade and have been filming my travels as I go along.

I try not to edit directly off my external drives, and I've got an 8TB M-class macbook pro that I've been lugging around with me around the world.      I'm trying to figure out how to handle my long term storage needs for the next few years of travel. On average, I'm capturing 100GB - 400GB per week of travel. I'm figuring I've got another 100 countries left to visit around the world, so 100 weeks * ~200GB per country maybe lands me in the ~20TB range of storage I'm anticipating I'll need for the remainder of my travels?      Does anyone have any suggestions here? Could I get away with getting 2 x 16TB SSDs with external enclosures and that 32TB worth of capacity would generously cover my needs with wiggle room? If so, what SSD + enclosure combo would you recommend?</Content></post><post><Title>Migrate from Unraid to OMV, SnapRAID, mergerfs. How to keep hard links, that span between two drives?</Title><Author>u/ChrisWreck</Author><Content>I'm in the middle of migrating from Unraid to OpenMediaVault, where I'll be using Snapraid and mergerfs.      I have 3 disks, one parity and two data drives. They're using XFS in Unraid. I want to use ext4 in OMV.      I have formatted the parity drive to ext4, and planned to move data from disk 1 to the parity drive, then format disk 1 to ext4, and then move all data from disk 2 to disk 1 and make disk 2 the new parity drive for SnapRAID.      However, I just realized I have hard links from the arr suite, spanning over both data disks ...      How can I migrate and preserve the hard links? Preferably without having to move all data to one disk in Unraid before migrating.      EDIT: For those of you wondering why I'm switching, I'm actually switching from Unraid to Proxmox, but I'll use OMV to handle my disks (combination of ZFS and ext4) and shares.</Content></post><post><Title>Question about Pixiv bulk downloading</Title><Author>u/_izix</Author><Content>Has anyone been blocked or banned from bulk downloading from pixiv?

I have been hunting for the right location to ask my many, many questions. This may not be technical enough for this subreddit, but it seemed like the right place to go.      I'm a big fan of physical media, likely casual to most here but to my friends I am perceived as intensely pro-physical media. As such, whenever people have spare tapes, CDs, DVDs, etc etc, I'm the man they throw them at.      Unfortunately, I am horribly unfamiliar with the digitization process for everything except for CDs and DVDs, and even then I occasionally have hiccups.      Recently I purchased the JVC RC-EZ38S CD Portable System (link to user manual) from a flea market to play some of my tapes and CDs, and realized I had a few tapes I'm unable to find anywhere online. Usually I wouldn't worry about my tapes growing old from wear because I can download songs and save them that way, but these tapes (mostly Halloween tracks) were impossible for me to find elsewhere, so I've been trying to preserve them.      The JVC product I purchased plays CDs, cassette tapes, and the radio. It has one single 3.5mm jack, a headphone output. I have done some googling, and found my best bet to save the audio is through a combination of cables and Audacity. Unfortunately, my computer only recognizes my aux cord as headphones, and I cannot treat my JVC product as a microphone when using Audacity. I have two cables - one aux with two 3.5mm ends, and one cable that has a male 3.5mm on one end and the other end has two male parts, white and yellow RCA jacks.      How, if at all, can I use my JVC player to preserve the tapes I have? Is there a special cord combination I may be able to put together that won't put me out of house and home (I'm unemployed and in a somewhat difficult spot financially, even a $20 purchase has me aghast sometimes) or would I be better off looking for a different product to record my tapes? A friend of mine is currently looking to rehome an old car radio with cassette player - Do those typically have RCA plugs, and would that be a way to go about this?      Anything helps, even just correcting my terms so I can communicate what I'm looking for a little better - I'm in a space where I truly don't know what it is that I don't know. I'd love to be a part of saving some lost media, even if it seems a little silly. People put work into those Halloween tapes, dammit!</Content></post><post><Title>What are the best options for adding disks to my setup?</Title><Author>u/StarLordOfTheDance</Author><Content>Is it possible to transition my setup from mergeFs+Snapraid to zfs without a lot of spare storage that I don't have?      I currently have 2x4TB mergeFs setup, with a 4TB drive for Snapraid parity. (Total 8TB usable storage). - currently holding 7TB of data      I have purchased 2x4TB more drives.

I built out my homelab to learn and get a job in IT. Mission success there. I've since gotten into all kinds of stuff and have a need to rework my storage, but I'm not sure how best to set things up.      Here's what I'm looking to do:      Complete separation of storage and compute Compute consists of a handful of VMs running on Proxmox, and critically, a Kubernetes cluster The cluster is currently running in VMs but I have plans to move just about everything into the cluster and move into SFF PCs This is partially why the complete separation is important, for flexibility and future migration      Here's what I have currently for equipment:      Brocade switch with 48x 1gbe and 8x10gig sfp 2x 12 bay 3.5" servers, one with Proxmox, one with TrueNAS 1x 24 bay 2.5" server Repurposed NetApp 24x 3.5" chassis, modified to work as DAS 4x 16gb spinners, currently in raidz1 ~32 old 2, 3, and 4gb spinners      I found that K8s cluster was very unstable with my first setup, which was an iscsi target on the TrueNAS server. The iSCSI share was mounted in Proxmox with LVM to create K8s VM OS and NFS storage for containers. This got much better when I moved to a local 3x SSD zpool on the Proxmox host. I understand that the latency with spinners and over the network was likely the cause, but this doesn't allow for the separation if like.      Use here is all over - media server is the main thing currently, which for transcoding needs fast seq read/writes, K8s app dev for work, and all kinds of testing containers for work and home. I'd also like to put all VM storage remote as well to play around with some different compute setups. I'd really love to be able to fully wipe Proxmox and try out XCP-ng, or Azure HCI, stuff like that... It's a lab, after all.      I'm competent enough to implement a solution, but I guess not enough experience yet to design. I'm not afraid of complex setup, but I do need redundancy, particularly if putting these small drives to use as I don't trust them - came for free with the NetApp shelf.      So... Any suggestions on how to set this up for minimal latency and fast read/write? Ceph? Mirrored ZFS using all those small spinners? Dedicated ZFS pools for each K8s node? Caching layers? Not against additional equipment, within reason, if needed.</Content></post><post><Title>Gallery-dl instagram help</Title><Author>u/Graestra</Author><Content>I'm trying to scrape an instagram account however gallery-dl isn't downloading all posts from the account.

My enterprise drives idle at 43-45 C which is ok, but could be a little better.

I don't let my drives spin down but if they were to, the fan does stop spinning after a while, afaik that's the only control the DAS has over the fan. So if i were to add a 2000rpm fan, would it instantly shoot up to that rpm and always spin that fast? Is there a way to control fan speed?

For anyone unaware, (almost) all SpongeBob episodes are split into A and B parts. For example, "Pizza Delivery" is only episode 5a, with "Home Sweet Pineapple" being episode 5b. Two "segments" make up one episode.      Normally this isn't a problem, as each segment in the SpongeBob DVDs has its own .mkv file. That is, until season 9, where there are no .mkv files for individual segments, only the combined episode. This is rather annoying as I don't want to scrub to the half-way mark of the videos just to watch the episode I actually want to see. I've thought of splitting the files in half, but it would be a tedious process as seasons are quite long.

After reading some posts, I thought about purchasing a license for Bvckup 2, which is more cost-effective and would allow me to use my other drives for backup.      My plan is to transfer data from the 5TB drive to one of the 8TB drives and periodically back up the data to the other 8TB drive. If I run out of space, I could use the 4TB drive similarly and back up data to the other 5TB drive.      While this might sound inefficient to experienced data hoarders, how bad/good is this idea?

Currently I don't use raid/parity of any kind... All drives are single volumes and it just sync's each drive from my main NAS to the second NAS, so I try to make the drive setup equal. However, the recent addition of the EXOS 16Tb kills that.      Since my main NAS is changing to a FreeBSD/TrueNAS with a ZFS pool, what's the best setup?      I was thinking maybe 8Tb+8Tb+6Tb+6Tb in the ZFS pool, then 16Tb+3Tb as single volumes on my second NAS. This way drives in the pool are as similar as possible in size and if parity wastes one drive, it will be about the same total capacity as the second NAS.

I know that Cathy and VVV have come up before on this subreddit. I was wondering if anyone's figured out some portable freeware that can do Boolean search.

I was able to find posts on this sub about nsfw bodyparts recognition, but its not what Im looking for.      What level of recognition? It must be able to tell appart photos of mass events, people, pets, documents, roads, buildings etc. Having them organized by a location metadata, perhaps. Finding similar (almost duplicate, but with different hash) images.      Would be great if I could select all the tagged images after, re-check them for false-positives, and delete.      The fileshare is hosted on OpenSuse VM, but I also can deploy and mount it on any other OS on the same server.

But I'm not doing actual streaming, just collecting an ever larger amount of images, RAW and jpg (I'm an event photographer hobbyist).      I would look at the NAS online and see perhaps a cheap 4 bay NAS, then look at the reviews and see a lot of complaints.  Seems like getting a reasonably reliable NAS would be more like getting a high end desktop.      For those digital hoarders who don't have a lot of streamable data, do you prefer NAS or just a big desktop with a lot of drive slots, and maybe a software RAID?  I tend to be a cheapskate so historically it's always been "buy another drive that's larger and copy stuff over" but I really need to start thinking long term.</Content></post><post><Title>Official Giveaway: June 2024 Seagate IronWolf Pro 16TB Hard Drive Giveaway</Title><Author>u/Seagate_Surfer</Author><Content>Hi r/DataHoarder crowd!

He gifted them to me a while back because, while he wouldn't admit it, his eyes are starting to go, and he couldn't enjoy them anymore. With the tablet he can zoom in as far as needed so I know he would love to revisit the comics once they are in digital form. Everything is in pristine condition with sleeves and backers, but there is nothing insanely valuable in the collection. He has a couple that are worth something, but most sit at &amp;gt;$10. That said, it would crush him if any were damaged so the scanning method must be non-destructive.      What I have tried:  Czur Aura Pro    Super quick, but random cropping and glare for days, even using the side lights. I tried using it with the official light box, outside the box, with 1-5 additional lights, with only external lights at every angle known to man, in a diffusion light box, with polarizers, etc. The only thing that worked 100% of the time was scanning while sitting on my back porch on an overcast day. I opened a ticket with their support and the response was "Make your room light bright enough, but do not have direct light shining on the book.". They didn't address the cropping issues.  Epson Perfection V600Epson Scan - Impressive for OEM software but inconsistent and changing the framing is a pain unless things are at perfect right angles.  VueScan - Sometimes it decides just not to scan, sometimes it scans and the image is black. When it does scan it does fine, but the auto skew is ~90% accurate which may as well be 0 because I have to adjust every single picture.  Silverfast - I was surprised at how much better the scans look, but the scans take 2-3 times as long as the Vue or Epson software. Also I have to take a prescan every time I move the page?      At this point I'm ready to hire a service if anyone has any suggestions, but I would really prefer to do the scanning myself because I plan on at least completing the series that he has, and probably expanding on them. I do have an R10 and an M50, so I could try some sort of diybookscanner.com solution, but that is a lot of effort for something that may or may not have different results.</Content></post><post><Title>NAS build...

No it's just cold storage drive I use when I need to access specific stuff, but mostly add to it, so there's no need to make sync after I will make copy of it (I'll just be adding on two different drives same stuff from another storage)..      What I found is.. It's reccomended to use software focused on that area of file operations. There are decent open source or free tools.. I have dilemmah wich of these I should use, but maybe there's some hidden gem you could recommend? Rsync - focused with good opinion, but commands line and no idea about speed FreeFileSync - GUI, rest as above did - I know that guy, I know it's missing a bit in speed but is quite tidy and could backup everything from one to another, right?

I've got two drives right now (8TB Seagate Archive drives) that died suddenly. One seems like it could be a bad logic board and I do have another with not just the same general board but the same batch? (same qr code) but haven't transferred the ROM between the boards to see if that will address it. The other (the one that died today while trying to transfer data to a new drive) will spin up but then makes a sound like the heads are seeking twice and then spins down. As I understand that's likely a hardware problem and not as home fixable.

As I work on developing a robust backup strategy for my NAS, I wonder if QNAP offers a native solution that allows splitting backups across multiple external drives automatically, without manually dividing my directories into chunks of 4 TB each.      The rationale is that a 24 TB backup cannot fit on a single 4 TB external HDD. This becomes even more apparent if I expand to a usable 144 TB in the future. In that case, it would be impossible to find a single 144 TB external drive, as such drives simply do not exist.

However, having only one backup copy of my shit is not a recipe for success. Having one is as good as having none as I like to say, redundancy is crucial when it comes to hoarding my data. Important pictures are backed up, the most important of which are printed out.      My consideration here is whether or not I get a high capacity internal HDD @ 7200 RPM or if I buy a high capacity portable HDD that can take abuse and is less likely to be damaged by physical adjustments and movements. This is rarely a concern in my day to day but I live in an earthquake prone area and I would agonise over losing everything to some shaking dirt.      I can't do both due to financial constraints at the moment but the decision is as follows;      Do I get a second external USB HDD that will be slower and have inferior transfer rates BUT be more protected in event of disaster and any other events that may happen (dog with zoomies for instance.)      or      Do I get a more efficient and practical internal HDD (I imagine its also cheaper) that I suspect to be significantly more fragile and susceptible to sudden movements and will likely be lost in the aforementioned events.      If the internal is selected, should I acquire this before the sale ends? If I should go with an external what should I acquire? I'd like something larger than my current 5TB.

I was looking to expand to ~30TB (with room to grow of course) for a couple of initiatives and initially had been set on a rack and rackmount server or NAS chassis with a bunch of 3.5" bays for price-efficient spinning drives.      The cost though! Racks = $$$ Rackmount Chassis or pre-builts = $$$$!      Every penny I would save in drive capacity I would pay back in getting a nice (home-office) rack and NAS.

Located in India</Title><Author>u/The_Bipolar_Guy</Author><Content>Building my first DIY NAS. Need 2+2 tb to start off with. Trying to be as cheap as possible. Will be storing all memories and irreplaceable things. Will get an external HDD for offsite backup. Also, I do not care about read write speeds. I just want my data to be safe and backed up at the end of the day for as cheap as possible, I will add new data maybe once a month if not even more rarely. I will be using my old motherboard (6 SATA ports) and processor. Will get a new 500 GB ssd for OS and new RAM.      Now here is the dilemma. I am from India and WD Purples are selling for 5250 INR each, cheapest. Next up, WD Blue is also selling for 6000+ INR. I can technically afford (but want to avoid at all costs) to get a 10TB UltraStar or EXOS for 22000 INR but I need two physical drives at least and my total storage need for backup right now or even 3 years later will not exceed 4-5TB. so a 10TB HDD will be useless, not to mention spending 45K INR on drives only (which is VERY VERY EXPENSIVE FOR ME).      I know WD Purple glosses over write errors and can be bad. Chucking is equally expensive, if not more. Should I just get 2x 2tb WD Purple for 10.5K INR and set up my backup server for now. Will add more HDDs later as needed (1-4 years later). Can I do anything to prevent the write errors?      Also, if there is a cheaper way, especially in the long run, I would appreciate it. Currently I have ~2TB data which grows by like 200-400GB a year. I have thought of BluRay drives but I am unable to procure new BluRay drives cheap enough.</Content></post><post><Title>VIA RAID disks question</Title><Author>u/thenovum</Author><Content>Hey.

Budget: hopefully &amp;lt;$10k?</Title><Author>u/immranderson</Author><Content>Hey! I've been living exclusively out of my backpack + carryon luggage for the last decade and have been filming my travels as I go along. I've been traveling around the world and have amassed a large collection of 2/4TB Samsung T-Series SSDs which is beginning to bump up against the physical carrying capacity in my bags.      Lucky enough I've got a 128GB Pixel 1 that I use still to this day for daily remote storage + backup, so that has served me well.      However, I also like to have local backups, and have been trying to shop around for SSDs. I'm trying to keep things as compact as possible, and I'm traveling so have avoided going the HDD route since my stuff can get pretty rough and tumbled quite often. I try not to edit directly off my external drives, and I've got an 8TB M-class macbook pro that I've been lugging around with me around the world.      I'm trying to figure out how to handle my long term storage needs for the next few years of travel. On average, I'm capturing 100GB - 400GB per week of travel. I'm figuring I've got another 100 countries left to visit around the world, so 100 weeks * ~200GB per country maybe lands me in the ~20TB range of storage I'm anticipating I'll need for the remainder of my travels?      Does anyone have any suggestions here? Could I get away with getting 2 x 16TB SSDs with external enclosures and that 32TB worth of capacity would generously cover my needs with wiggle room? If so, what SSD + enclosure combo would you recommend?</Content></post><post><Title>Migrate from Unraid to OMV, SnapRAID, mergerfs. How to keep hard links, that span between two drives?</Title><Author>u/ChrisWreck</Author><Content>I'm in the middle of migrating from Unraid to OpenMediaVault, where I'll be using Snapraid and mergerfs.      I have 3 disks, one parity and two data drives. They're using XFS in Unraid. I want to use ext4 in OMV.      I have formatted the parity drive to ext4, and planned to move data from disk 1 to the parity drive, then format disk 1 to ext4, and then move all data from disk 2 to disk 1 and make disk 2 the new parity drive for SnapRAID.      However, I just realized I have hard links from the arr suite, spanning over both data disks ...      How can I migrate and preserve the hard links? Preferably without having to move all data to one disk in Unraid before migrating.      EDIT: For those of you wondering why I'm switching, I'm actually switching from Unraid to Proxmox, but I'll use OMV to handle my disks (combination of ZFS and ext4) and shares.</Content></post><post><Title>Question about Pixiv bulk downloading</Title><Author>u/_izix</Author><Content>Has anyone been blocked or banned from bulk downloading from pixiv?

I have been hunting for the right location to ask my many, many questions. This may not be technical enough for this subreddit, but it seemed like the right place to go.      I'm a big fan of physical media, likely casual to most here but to my friends I am perceived as intensely pro-physical media. As such, whenever people have spare tapes, CDs, DVDs, etc etc, I'm the man they throw them at.      Unfortunately, I am horribly unfamiliar with the digitization process for everything except for CDs and DVDs, and even then I occasionally have hiccups.      Recently I purchased the JVC RC-EZ38S CD Portable System (link to user manual) from a flea market to play some of my tapes and CDs, and realized I had a few tapes I'm unable to find anywhere online. Usually I wouldn't worry about my tapes growing old from wear because I can download songs and save them that way, but these tapes (mostly Halloween tracks) were impossible for me to find elsewhere, so I've been trying to preserve them.      The JVC product I purchased plays CDs, cassette tapes, and the radio. It has one single 3.5mm jack, a headphone output. I have done some googling, and found my best bet to save the audio is through a combination of cables and Audacity. Unfortunately, my computer only recognizes my aux cord as headphones, and I cannot treat my JVC product as a microphone when using Audacity. I have two cables - one aux with two 3.5mm ends, and one cable that has a male 3.5mm on one end and the other end has two male parts, white and yellow RCA jacks.      How, if at all, can I use my JVC player to preserve the tapes I have? Is there a special cord combination I may be able to put together that won't put me out of house and home (I'm unemployed and in a somewhat difficult spot financially, even a $20 purchase has me aghast sometimes) or would I be better off looking for a different product to record my tapes? A friend of mine is currently looking to rehome an old car radio with cassette player - Do those typically have RCA plugs, and would that be a way to go about this?      Anything helps, even just correcting my terms so I can communicate what I'm looking for a little better - I'm in a space where I truly don't know what it is that I don't know. I'd love to be a part of saving some lost media, even if it seems a little silly. People put work into those Halloween tapes, dammit!</Content></post><post><Title>What are the best options for adding disks to my setup?</Title><Author>u/StarLordOfTheDance</Author><Content>Is it possible to transition my setup from mergeFs+Snapraid to zfs without a lot of spare storage that I don't have?      I currently have 2x4TB mergeFs setup, with a 4TB drive for Snapraid parity. (Total 8TB usable storage). - currently holding 7TB of data      I have purchased 2x4TB more drives.

I built out my homelab to learn and get a job in IT. Mission success there. I've since gotten into all kinds of stuff and have a need to rework my storage, but I'm not sure how best to set things up.      Here's what I'm looking to do:      Complete separation of storage and compute Compute consists of a handful of VMs running on Proxmox, and critically, a Kubernetes cluster The cluster is currently running in VMs but I have plans to move just about everything into the cluster and move into SFF PCs This is partially why the complete separation is important, for flexibility and future migration      Here's what I have currently for equipment:      Brocade switch with 48x 1gbe and 8x10gig sfp 2x 12 bay 3.5" servers, one with Proxmox, one with TrueNAS 1x 24 bay 2.5" server Repurposed NetApp 24x 3.5" chassis, modified to work as DAS 4x 16gb spinners, currently in raidz1 ~32 old 2, 3, and 4gb spinners      I found that K8s cluster was very unstable with my first setup, which was an iscsi target on the TrueNAS server. The iSCSI share was mounted in Proxmox with LVM to create K8s VM OS and NFS storage for containers. This got much better when I moved to a local 3x SSD zpool on the Proxmox host. I understand that the latency with spinners and over the network was likely the cause, but this doesn't allow for the separation if like.      Use here is all over - media server is the main thing currently, which for transcoding needs fast seq read/writes, K8s app dev for work, and all kinds of testing containers for work and home. I'd also like to put all VM storage remote as well to play around with some different compute setups. I'd really love to be able to fully wipe Proxmox and try out XCP-ng, or Azure HCI, stuff like that... It's a lab, after all.      I'm competent enough to implement a solution, but I guess not enough experience yet to design. I'm not afraid of complex setup, but I do need redundancy, particularly if putting these small drives to use as I don't trust them - came for free with the NetApp shelf.      So... Any suggestions on how to set this up for minimal latency and fast read/write? Ceph? Mirrored ZFS using all those small spinners? Dedicated ZFS pools for each K8s node? Caching layers? Not against additional equipment, within reason, if needed.</Content></post><post><Title>Gallery-dl instagram help</Title><Author>u/Graestra</Author><Content>I'm trying to scrape an instagram account however gallery-dl isn't downloading all posts from the account.

My enterprise drives idle at 43-45 C which is ok, but could be a little better.      So i thought about adding a new and better fan to the enclosure (Icy Box IB-3805-C31), but the fan never changes speeds, literally never. I don't let my drives spin down but if they were to, the fan does stop spinning after a while, afaik that's the only control the DAS has over the fan. So if i were to add a 2000rpm fan, would it instantly shoot up to that rpm and always spin that fast? Is there a way to control fan speed?

For anyone unaware, (almost) all SpongeBob episodes are split into A and B parts. For example, "Pizza Delivery" is only episode 5a, with "Home Sweet Pineapple" being episode 5b. Two "segments" make up one episode.      Normally this isn't a problem, as each segment in the SpongeBob DVDs has its own .mkv file. That is, until season 9, where there are no .mkv files for individual segments, only the combined episode. This is rather annoying as I don't want to scrub to the half-way mark of the videos just to watch the episode I actually want to see. I've thought of splitting the files in half, but it would be a tedious process as seasons are quite long.      Are there any programs or tools that would make this easier?</Content></post><post><Title>Seeking Advice on Cost-Effective Backup Solutions for Multiple Hard Drives (beginner) - Thoughts on Bvckup 2?</Title><Author>u/AlvTellez</Author><Content>I have several larger hard drives:      5TB portable drive connected to my HTPC for films and series via Plex      Two unused 8TB drives      4TB drive containing important media (that doesn't fit in my laptop and/or is more important)      Initially, I considered getting a Synology NAS, but with less than 10TB of actual data, it seems like overkill, especially since I rarely access this data and usually keep the drives unplugged, except for the 5TB drive that's always connected to my HTPC (I also don't really need a NAS for my Plex needs, since I already have the HTPC as a server for that).      After reading some posts, I thought about purchasing a license for Bvckup 2, which is more cost-effective and would allow me to use my other drives for backup.      My plan is to transfer data from the 5TB drive to one of the 8TB drives and periodically back up the data to the other 8TB drive. If I run out of space, I could use the 4TB drive similarly and back up data to the other 5TB drive.      While this might sound inefficient to experienced data hoarders, how bad/good is this idea?

One EXOS 16Tb, two Barracuda 8Tb, one IronWolf 6Tb, on WD "white" 6Tb and on WD Red 3Tb. My main NAS is a desktop with +6 slots, my second NAS is a 4 bay Asustor.      Currently I don't use raid/parity of any kind... All drives are single volumes and it just sync's each drive from my main NAS to the second NAS, so I try to make the drive setup equal. However, the recent addition of the EXOS 16Tb kills that.      Since my main NAS is changing to a FreeBSD/TrueNAS with a ZFS pool, what's the best setup?      I was thinking maybe 8Tb+8Tb+6Tb+6Tb in the ZFS pool, then 16Tb+3Tb as single volumes on my second NAS. This way drives in the pool are as similar as possible in size and if parity wastes one drive, it will be about the same total capacity as the second NAS.      Does this make sense?</Content></post><post><Title>Using CRC or the like for music backup checking</Title><Author>u/__99999</Author><Content>Hello, I know about the various ways to get a crc and sha etc. I'm trying to find a program that keeps the same crc if I change the Metadata of the audio file.

I was able to find posts on this sub about nsfw bodyparts recognition, but its not what Im looking for.      What level of recognition? It must be able to tell appart photos of mass events, people, pets, documents, roads, buildings etc. Having them organized by a location metadata, perhaps. Finding similar (almost duplicate, but with different hash) images.      Would be great if I could select all the tagged images after, re-check them for false-positives, and delete.

But I'm not doing actual streaming, just collecting an ever larger amount of images, RAW and jpg (I'm an event photographer hobbyist).      I would look at the NAS online and see perhaps a cheap 4 bay NAS, then look at the reviews and see a lot of complaints.  Seems like getting a reasonably reliable NAS would be more like getting a high end desktop.      For those digital hoarders who don't have a lot of streamable data, do you prefer NAS or just a big desktop with a lot of drive slots, and maybe a software RAID?  I tend to be a cheapskate so historically it's always been "buy another drive that's larger and copy stuff over" but I really need to start thinking long term.</Content></post><post><Title>Will youtube ad Injections break music downloads?</Title><Author>u/Nerds_r_us45</Author><Content>I like downloading some channels in bulk and idk if this will break my ability to hoard music easily or not.</Content></post><post><Title>Is it possible to save an online quiz  to offline and use it offline and recieve results?</Title><Author>u/dokha</Author><Content>It’s important to note thats the kind of assessment pages im talking about are the casual ones such as the fun ones you take on Buzzfeed and the ones you see on astrology sites..

For context, I'm mostly a hobbyist photographer that wants to just keep my data safe and I don't believe I'd have a need for most of what a NAS offers, so I'm looking into DAS/JBOD as a solution. I currently have around 6TB of photo/video I consider "important" enough to backup.      My current setup is just a single 14 TB WD External HD which is not really being backed up anywhere so I'd like to improve my setup.      At the core, I'm currently planning on doing the following:      Buying a new 8TB HDD that I'll be "working off of", and moving all of my existing data into it      Buying a 4 bay DAS, either using 2 drives for now for RAID1 or buying 4 for RAID4/5 (??) to periodically mirror data from the single 8TB drive onto.      Using Backblaze to backup my PC + DAS.      Does this setup make sense for my needs? If it does make sense, does anybody have any particular product recommendations for the DAS/JBOD and if there's any specific thing to look for in the type of drive(s) to purchase? Is this perhaps overkill for the use case?

For text-heavy books I use the CamScanner app, and then scan the cover using my flatbed. Non destructive, very effective. For magazines and newspapers, the flatbed is usually enough, as the lack of a solid spine makes scanning with minimal wear very easy.      Now comes my problem: I have a lot of image-heavy books that I want to scan, but I have yet to find a good method to do so.    CamScanner is horrid at dealing with illustrations and photographs. The flatbed works alright, but not great. Because I avoid breaking the book's spine, there are always visible shadows and both text and images become a little blurry when they're close to the hinge.  I'm wondering if there's an app similar to CamScanner but more appropriate for photographs? Or a different method altogether.    I know some people melt the glue keeping the spine together, scan the pages individually, and then glue everything back on. This wouldn't work for all of the books in my collection- but I have considered trying it on a handful of them. I'm just a little scared of screwing the process up.      Thanks in advance.</Content></post><post><Title>Why is XFS not more popular? Are there are any concerns with XFS still?</Title><Author>u/ECrispy</Author><Content>This is for home desktop usage, not servers/data centers where XFS is far more common.      performance - in every test I could find, XFS is near the top, beating btrfs/ext4. Its esp good for parallel workloads and almost everything on a modern desktop is like that. The only perf concern I read about is it used to have higher cpu usage for updating metadata but I believe thats been fixed and no longer relevant?      (I think for most users, performance in benchmarks may not be noticeable and other features matter more, but its still an important consideration)      SSD/OS installs - XFS is almost as fast as f2fs for these. I see no reason why anyone would use f2fs on anything other than a sd card or on any NAND device with wear leveling.      CoW/snapshots - this is no doubt a very powerful feature of zfs/btrfs. But I see very little mention of reflinks/snapshots on XFS which can achieve a lot of this. They are not atomic but enough to satisfy a lot of use cases. I don't see support for this in the usual tools like snapper/timeshift either. XFS also has support for deduping. All of this comes without the usual cost of CoW      other features - dynamic inodes (on ext4 an inode for every 16kb/256kb is wasteful, even if most people never notice it), automatic fsck, journalling (sure, copied from ext3, but thats not a bad thing)      stability/reliability - I don't think there should be any doubt about this. Its a proven enterprise class fs with a hallowed pedigree and reputation, is now backed by RHEL and has probably seen more active development than most other file systems.      The biggest factor seems to be that the default ext4 is good enough, and frankly most people will not care or know about, and should not care, about the underlying fs. There are also distros like Fedora/OpenSuse that used to use XFS as the default and have switched to btrfs. I don't know of anything that uses XFS as default except unRaid now - unRaid is used to manage TBs by home users and that probably says something.      The only concerns I've found are -      a) it doesn't support shrinking a volume. how common is this anyway? I've never seen any home user need to do this, 99% of the time you only need this when you are installing another OS on the same ssd/hdd and need to shrink your current /, which is an advanced use case.      b)supposedly XFS doesn't handle hw failures. Even on this I found no consensus - some people say its risky and can corrupt with no recovery, others say even with a forced  shutdown its safe. I'm not sure if its any less robust than ext4/btrfs? Is this actually a concern these days?</Content></post><post><Title>Recertified EXOS X18 constantly reading?</Title><Author>u/wiadrovit</Author><Content>Hey there Guys,      I've bought a recertified EXOS X18 12TB for my NAS. The drive isn't exactly loud and it performs as I would expect, but there's one thing that I can't walk past - it acts as if it was doing something, even when completely idle.      The drive lives in my Sabrent DS-SC5B hdd enclosure which I've been using for over a year now and which I'm very satisfied with.      Video: https://imgur.com/a/o39cfd8 (it's the second one from the top - as you can see its LED is blinking in a regular manner).      I've read that EXOS drives have their own APM feature which can be disabled using seachest tool. I've managed to successfully disable both EPC as well as the power balance feature, but that didn't change anything, the LED still blinks and I can hear a regular, gentle cracking sound as if something was read/written.      The drive is mounted on my Debian installation and I've confirmed that no process is using it. What's weird is that activities stop as soon as I unmount the drive (and start again as soon as I mount it back).      In fact, this is a second drive that does the same thing. I've returned previous one to the seller as I've felt something is not right with it. Both were manufactured (or rather reassembled?) back in March 2024.      I should add that I have another EXOS drive (X16 16TB sitting in my backup device) and it doesn't act this way.      Is it normal for these drives or do you think I should return this one as well and go for something else?      It isn't that much annoying, I am just worried that if the head keeps flying all the time, the drive will wear sooner and might die prematurely.

So please don't come saying get a 2TB NVME, get a 2.5 SATA SSD and yap yap yap.. And I have other systems too. One EATX, One MFF, Two SFF and One HTPC. So I am not a new builder. Posting here since it will be more appropriate than posting in Homelab or DataHoarder sub.      As we know it we have very limited SFF cases with HDD support. Manufacturers hardly make them anymore.      Some options that we have today:      Node 304: Outdated and front panel is very restrictive. 92mm fans in front are noisy as they are 3pin. In my country I can't find any 92mm fan.      Jonsbo N series: Pat on the back for Jonsbo on launching several SFF NAS cases back to back. They feel like they have restrictive airflow. They aren't available in my country.      SAMA IM 01 and its copies: Supports 4 - 5. A cheap knock of this is available. But is an option.      So my question is have you guys though about squeezing extra HDDs in cases like Deepcool CH 160, Coolermaster NR200P etc. For example if I can use rear fan mount for 120 AIO intake then does 120 fan slot above have motherboard has hinges for 3. 5"HDD? Does it have space to tuck one below a dual slot dual fan GPU. I know 1 3.5" HDD can go on front panel when I use a SFX PSU. Similarly for NR200P. More suggestions are welcome. I'll use a Noctua L9i or 120 AIO as I have then lying around.

How many of you have had a year as bad as mine so far?      5 failures. 1 DOA      Parity 1 and 2 went in January      The first Replacement Drive was DOA      Data Disks 5, 8 and 11 have since failed.      I've been able to recover 90% of the data through the use of my backups and catching the problem in time. But seriously. 6 drives have died on me this year. And we're only half way through the year.      They're dying so frequently that I can barely afford to replace them.      Now. For the details.      Parity Disk 2 had a physical fault of some kind. Reallocated sector counts when from 0 to 256 in one night.      Parity 1 had a controller board failure (This will be a common cause. I've figured out the problem since this happened.)      Data Disk 5 kicked the bucket spectacularly. The Seek Error Rate went from 85% accurate, which is the average in my server due to how many disks are in there. To 1% in the span of 3 days. Making it infuriatingly slow to get any data off the drive but still possible.      Data 8 and 11 both experienced controller board failures. Strange drop outs in connection, hang ups, read and write error flags despite no data corruption either reading or writing. Obviously I couldn't trust those drives anymore.      But this thing is, only 2 of these failures are genuine faults. The other 3 are my fault.      The drives that had controller board failures, at least some of them, were due to how much pressure was being put on the sata connectors when I closed the side panel. Yes, I'm serious. In any other circumstance, the Define R6 would have ample room for sata power and data cables at the rear of the case. But when you have 11 drives and all their cables back there, the thickness of the noise dampening foam presses into those cables and puts dangerous amounts of pressure on the connectors.      I proved this by running read checks on the "failing drives" with and without the side panel on. With it off, 1 drive had errors 100% of the time. With it on, all drives showed the same errors. Errors which disappeared when I removed the side panel... SMH.      So now I need to replace yet more drives, the cables and the case.      My server is a bottomless money pit. It has to be.</Content></post><post><Title>New drives, questions about testing</Title><Author>u/lilbud2000</Author><Content>Yesterday I bought my first "big" refurb hard drives (2x12TB HGST drives, upgrade from a 2TB and 4TB drive).      The current plan is to have one in my computer, and use the second as a backup with an external enclosure. Probably not the "best" way to do it, but it should suffice in the meantime.      Currently waiting for them to ship and looking into the whole testing process in the meantime.      I was wondering what would be the best way to test them, as I've read about a bunch of different ones (like smartctl, Badblocks, HD Sentinel, etc.) And it's making my head spin a bit.      I guess my questions are as followed:      What/how many tests need to be run on a refurb drive? I've seen some posts listing multiple long tests and others just saying a few SMART tests. Is there any general consensus?      Badblocks is on Linux only, would that work on something like WSL? Or would I have to get a Linux machine/VM setup? I have a Pi 3 collecting dust, could that be used?      How long would testing the drives take? I've seen that a full badblocks 4 pass run can take days or even a week of 24/7 running just for one drive. Does that sound right? I was thinking about using a secondary machine like my old Thinkpad if it was going to take a week. My desktop (where the drive will eventually end up) is in use daily, and I'd be a bit concerned about leaving it on but not killing the test accidentally.      I'm a bit new to all this, only having a 2TB and 4TB drive for the past few years. Any help in making sense of all this would be appreciated.</Content></post><post><Title>Ripping entire Russian Encyclopedia - viable?</Title><Author>u/gulisav</Author><Content>I'm not extremely tech savy, so I have some possibly silly questions.      Two days ago it's been announced that Great Russian Encyclopedia has been given no funding this year at all and the encyclopedia will be discontinued. (The encyclopedia is a heir to the Great Soviet Encyclopedia, and is fairly decent as far as general encyclopedias go.) Apparently Russia has bigger priorities than funding an encyclopedia... So, I think I might try my hand at saving the encyclopedia's online edition, before it 404s. Now, there are two domains, bigenc and old.bigenc (both .ru domains), and I'll focus on the latter. It seems fairly simple to rip, because each encyclopedic article has a corresponding PDF file, with the URLs only changing their final number (with 6 or 7 digits). I could produce a list of all the possible URLs in Excel. However, if I were to feed that list to a download manager, I'm wondering if that would cause any serious issues on the part of the server. There's probably close to a hundred thousand articles available on the site, and the downloader would also have to check possibly millions of URLs that contain no PDFs. Would this be like a sort of borderline DDOS attack? Could my requests be blocked?      Furthermore, even if I rip all that stuff, it would result in thousands of files with nothing in particular to identify them, as the filenames are just numbers. Is there a way to derive the article titles from the text within the PDFs (which ofc include the title of the article) and rename the files accordingly?      (The PDFs themselves are small in size, so I'm not worrying about space constraints.)</Content></post><post><Title>Safe to buy 3 yr old HDD?</Title><Author>u/Shumhow</Author><Content>Found a seller online selling a 1TB laptop HDD with casing for about 15 USD.

Currently I have an old desktop, i5-4690 + ASUS H97 Pro + 16Gb RAM, with 3Tb WD Red + 6Tb IronWolf + 8Tb Barracuda drives and 2.5GbE + 1GbE interfaces. This works as my Plex server and it's where I dump files from the desktop/laptop, it's running on Windows 10 for now, but about to switch to FreeBSD or TrueNAS (or Proxmox?) with ZFS pool.Now I've added an Asustor AS1102TL Drivestor 2 Lite (2 bays, 1GbE) which is probably being returned for an AS1104T Drivestor 4 (4 bays, 2,5GbE). It is supposed to be a remote NAS using Wireguard, that's why I didn't care for 1GbE, but the initial backup is taking a LONG time. The price difference is only 100€ for more bays and speed (useful for full copies and full restores if needed). Here there's a 6Tb WD "white label" and an 8Tb Barracuda as single volumes (JBOD looks risky and can't use RAID with different drives).      Part of my issue is which file transfer protocol to use. NFS? My desktop and laptop are Windows, not sure NFS works properly. FTP? Or SMB? SMB is giving me speed issues, not going over 150MBps and for some reason when cloning the 6Tb IronWolf to the 6Tb WD "white label" the speed sinks to 10MBps. It's copying RAW photos and videos, like thousands of 50-100Mb files mostly.      Having file access sorted, what's your recommendation for file transfer/backup? Asustor Backup Plan? Paragon Backup and Recovery? Macrium Reflect? Or, since I already own SyncBackPro, just use that? This question is related to both, from my computers to the main NAS and main NAS to the Asustor.      A little guidance will be much appreciated, since I want to go through this once and "forget". My day job is IT PM so I know my way around a computer, but by far not an expert in this area. ty</Content></post><post><Title>What is the best way to go about cloning a 1 tb HDD with 48 bad sectors to an ssd?</Title><Author>u/mudcakes2000</Author><Content>I've installed aoemi backupper and ive seen there is an option to clone "sector by sector" however I have heard for large drives this can take hundred of hours.

I've read many debates saying just get an HBA card instead of a RAID card but I've never actually seen any performance (real world statistics) comparing the two.

Well I have joined the club and am now the proud owner of a Supermicro 45 Bay JBOD Expansion Server Shelf 847E16-RJBOD1 with ~30 drives and ~460TB. Currently have it hooked up via 2 SFF-8088 to SFF-8088 cables to a LSI 9201-16e 6Gbps 16-lane external SAS HBA installed in my "server".      This is replacing my previous setup with the same "server", 2 x LSI 9201-16e 6Gbps 16-lane external SAS HBA cards with 8 x SFF-8088 to 4 SATA cables running to 8 x RSV-SATA-Cage-34 that are/were on a couple of shelves.      Been up and running for about a week and thoughts so far are:      It looks cool in the 4-post 42U rack      It is loud! (I knew it was loud but that holy s#$% moment when you first power it up)      snapraid backup/scrub is only happening at about 2/3 the speed of before (sort of knew this as well)      that was a lot of screws to remove the drives from the RSV caddies and screw them into the JBOD caddies.      It looks cool!      As mentioned, I have it hooked up via 2 SFF-8088 to SFF-8088 cables, one for each backplane, and am wondering if I can hook up the other 2 SFF-8088 ports on the JBOD with two more cables to get some additional speed. I did read the manual it it discusses the other two ports are used for daisy-chaining but you never know.      Not being one to let well enough alone, I am now on the journey to repackage my two "servers", one from above and the other used for acquiring linux ISO's, into a couple of 2U cases so I can get them nicely into the rack.      For the latter, am thinking about a RackChoice MicroATX/Mini-ITX 2U Rackmount Server Chassis as I am running a mitx MB and a couple of 3.5 drives and a couple of SSD's with no add-on cards so should fit just nice.      For the former, the "server" hooked to the JBOD, I am looking at this RackChoice 2U Rackmount Server Chassis as it allows full height cards to be used via PCI riser so I can keep using the HBA card I already have. The other option I am looking at is picking up a LSI SAS 9300-8e 12Gb/s SATA/SAS and a couple SFF-8644 to Mini SAS SFF-8088 cables and a 2nd RackChoice MicroATX/Mini-ITX 2U Rackmount Server Chassis but I am not sure if the SAS3 HBA is backwards compatible with SAS2 backplanes.      Anyway, the adventure continues ....

I've always played it super risky because all my data has never been properly backed up or duplicated. Now I want my files to be available between different (windows) computers. Ideally, every change would automatically get synced between both computers, through a cloud storage provider (that also stores the files for access from outside), as long as either computer is connected to the internet.      Now, plenty of services offer this, in its most basic form. I get 1TB OneDrive though my parents' family plan and OneDrive is pretty nice. It integrates well enough into Windows. But there is one major limitation that makes it pretty much unsuitable for me: I don't want all my syncable data to be in one single folder. I want it spread out over different folders and even drives, because I run quite a few different drives with different purposes.      Is there a service that basically offers a way to set custom endpoints for syncable folders? Say I have a cloud folder /Files, then I want a client that runs on any connected computer where I can set /Files to be synced to G:\Files, or to C:\Users\some_user\Documents\CloudFiles on another computer?

In this case, is it okay to just build a decently powerful modern personal desktop - killing 2 birds with 1 s tone, instead of building 2 computers, one for desktop (desperately need the upgrade now) and one specifically for a server/nas? Is this totally okay?      I live by myself so aside from being a personal computer with data storage, it'll just be serving me alone at home. To be honest, at the moment, I pretty much just consume media on my desktop, so even nas/media server features like plex, jellyfins aren't even 100% necessary - though nice to have perhaps in the future.  Summary: Decently powerful personal desktop with a focus on datahoarding/data storage that can also perform some server side of things like running VMs, and other homelab things down the road.  OS: FreeBSD with ZFS + ECC Memory  CASE: thinking of a big case like Fractal Design Define 7 XL that is capable of holding 14-18 HDDs.  MOBO:  SSD: What's a good NVMe 2.0 ?(maybe 1TB)  CPU: amd or intel? what series/models would you guys recommend?  MEM: looking for ECC ram as the main focus will be data storage. but how much memory will I need for zfs (assuming I will fill up the whole case with 18 HDDs down the road)?  GPU: a gpu capable of driving maybe a LG DualUp 2560 x 2880 with a 34" 1440p 3440×1440 ultrawide monitor. I will also be doing some photo editing with darktable, rawtherapee, etc. as well so a designated gpu that is good enough should be enough. (don't think there will be much gaming).  PSU: how big of a power supply? keep in mind the full capacity is 18 HDD, with dual monitor, etc.  CPU COOLER:  HDD: thinking of 18 or 20TB seagate exos (are they too loud to use in the bedroom in a personal desktop? should i go for ironwolf pro?)</Content></post><post><Title>5x3.5 tool-less drive bay prices</Title><Author>u/Doodarazumas</Author><Content>I'm putting together a nas and I saw several threads where people recommended these kind of 3x5.25 to 5x3.5 hard drive cages  https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00DWHLFMA/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_glt_fabc_ZJWWH4ZW3JXHXF89RMN3?_encoding=UTF8&amp;amp;th=1https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00DWHLFMA/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_glt_fabc_ZJWWH4ZW3JXHXF89RMN3?_encoding=UTF8&amp;amp;th=1    plus silverstone/rosewill/etc.      Now most of these threads were from a few years back and since then the prices on all these things have tripled or quadrupled.

I'm not asking for help doing piracy 101 or anything.      Hi fellow hoarders. I'm not sure if this is the right place to post this, but I figure this is a good place to ask fellow hoarders about what they hoard. Feel free to lmk if you think there's a better place to post this.      I'm trying to archive the different versions of Disney movies that have regional differences. For example, I have the different versions of Inside Out where Riley hates either broccoli (US) or green bell peppers (Japan).      Most movies only have a few variations, but Cars 2 and Planes each has about 7 variations each where the design of a car or a plane changes depending on the region. I've gotten nearly all of them, and almost all the variations of all the other movies, except for three:      Chinese Zootopia (secondary newscaster is a panda)      Russian Cars 2 (Car is styled as the Russian flag)      Russian Planes (the "sexy" girl plane is styled after the Russian flag)      You can probably see why I'm having trouble with these. Disney+ isn't offered in those countries for geopolitical reasons.      I've scoured the internet that is available to me looking for ways to source these either physically or digitally, but even my non-public sources are not very interested in this kind of thing.

I have a NAS with 16TB of active storage using RAID. As a newbie, I didn’t even think about the possibility of my NAS drives failing with time, especially after reading horror stories with seagate ironwolf drives which I’m currently using.      I hate SaaS and cloud, and would much prefer a local backup to my Synology NAS. What drives do you recommend? Been looking at the WD My Book 16TB or Easystore 18TB from Amazon, but I’m unsure. I don’t care about house fires / theft, so ignore that risk of backup solutions.      Taking all ideas!

I'm prepping to do a migration to trunas and a set of larger drives and an also 9305 card but until I can get some new drives I'm limping along with this old card.      I currently have a RAID6 array of 9 4tb WD red drives. One degraded and it's been trying to rebuild. I'm currently running windows server 2016 essentials. I think something is causing the is to bsod while rebuilding the array. So I went into the cards bios to rebuild there.      Does anyone know if the card will rebuild while I'm in the bios screen of the card? I would rather leave it there and let it rebuild.      It could also be the drive is hosed and I need to buy a new one. Not sure why the drive went degraded except that we had a storm the other night and my UPSs battery apparently failed (less than 6 months old) and the server hard shutdown. The drives were unlikely to be writing anything as I don't currently write to that array. It's purely read operations.      Any help would be greatly appreciated.      *Btw I have backed up data to external drives, but I would still rather not lose the data as I could mount the array and make copying to the new array in trunas faster.</Content></post><post><Title>Cold storage backups</Title><Author>u/Vatican87</Author><Content>What's the best way to backup important media (Photos / Videos), are cold storage options the best way?

Now, storage is NOT my forte. I know enough to be dangerous to myself. How do I go about replacing the failing card without losing all my data?

Complete novice to home server operation.  After discussion in another thread, I've decided to not go with Windows OS on the server and instead run a Linux based OS so some sort.      My hardware is a i5-9500 with 8gb or ram. In terms of storage I have a 256gb m2 NVME, 2x 10tb HDD and a 256g 2.5" SSD if it is useful in some way. This leaves me with 2 sata3 ports(1 if I use the 2.5" SSD) and 1 m2 slot available for further expansion of storage.      Initial intended uses are to run JellyFin media server, Home Assistant and an image management app for pics, all local.      I would like full redundancy via raid1, this is where I'm a bit uncertain on approach.      I assume I'll run the OS and any apps on the NVME, not the HDD. Since i have the additional NVME slot available is there benefit to adding a second NVME drive for cache or even a mirror of the OS and apps?      Should I be looking to manage my raid with an application of some sort or in the Debian OS itself?      If the raid is setup in Debian, how does that affect future expansion? Do i have to add pairs of drives or could I for example just add a 18tb random drive?      If for example a year from now I add 2 additional drives, at that time would there be a better solution than raid1?

The drive is originally in exFAT with some warranty content on it. I have Windows 10, so not using badblocks, but have HD Sentinel. My order is this:      Minimum:  Short Long self-test (which will do an initial READ)      Surface WRITE+Read with default 0's      Quick format (to NTFS for use)      Extensive:      Short self-test      Quick format (to NTFS, solely for the next step)      Filling disk with large files (using TeraCopy verify+test using H2TestW)      Surface READ test      Surface WRITE+Read with default 0's      Surface WRITE+Read with 1's (0xFF)    Surface WRITE+Read back with 0's      Quick format (to NTFS)      Alternatively, badblocks instead of steps 5-7, or full u/EchoGecko795 routine below in the comments.      Thanks to everyone, all questions answered!      Some notes:  Extended self-test can be skipped, as it just short self-test + READ test sequence within the drive, just less informative than the Surface read test as doesn't consider connectivity performance  Full format in Windows isn't needed, as it's the same as Surface READ + WRITE (with 0's) tests, maybe more limited, and quick format is enough just to change the filesystem      Different surface write+read patterns emulate the 4-pass badblocks test      A few things I wanted to clarify:      how redundant is filling the drive with files, considering further WRITE+Read surface test? Does it only serve as another WRITE pass, just with different data?      do I really need the Read test before the WRITE+Read test, or is the latter enough? (i.e. can a READ before WRITE indicate something that a READ after WRITE won't?). My idea was to see the initial READ after the drive is filled with files, then overwriting it with 0's and reading again      how important is changing the pattern/flipping 0's to 1's?      should I flip 1's to 0's back again? Can the 1's pattern remain, following a quick format prior to using the drive?      And finally, is the more time-consuming 3-4 pass procedure really worth it, and not an overkill?</Content></post><post><Title>Regarding Uloz.to</Title><Author>u/HakimOne</Author><Content>Hi,      Any thoughts on https://ulozto.net ?

When I looked at Amazon I saw that there are many options of new models if standard spinning drives for much less.      As far as I know from reading over the years spinning drives are more likely to fail than the spinning disk drives.  But I haven’t ever actually seen the test data to see just how likely or unlikely they are to break compared to SSD.      If this drive is going to be used only at home and not carried anywhere, does anyone have any idea just how much more likely it is to fail than an SSD?

The serial numbers do trace back to Seagate, but I'm experiencing some unusual issues with it. Has anyone else encountered this?      Here's what's happening when I test it with my Windows machine:      With the machine powered off, I plug in the drive, but the machine doesn't boot.      With the machine powered off, I boot to BIOS, and the disk is found. However, after rebooting, the machine doesn't boot.      If I unplug the drive after step 2, the machine boots normally.      If I plug the drive back in at the login screen, the machine freezes.      If I log in first and then plug the drive in, I can see the task manager showing max activity on my main OS SSD before the machine freezes. Unplugging the drive at this point unfreezes the machine.      I've bought a number of drives this way before and never had a serious issue. Any insights or suggestions would be greatly appreciated. In the meantime I am reaching out to the seller.

Complete novice to home server operation.  After discussion in another thread, I've decided to not go with Windows OS on the server and instead run a Linux based OS so some sort.      My hardware is a i5-9500 with 8gb or ram. In terms of storage I have a 256gb m2 NVME, 2x 10tb HDD and a 256g 2.5" SSD if it is useful in some way. This leaves me with 2 sata3 ports(1 if I use the 2.5" SSD) and 1 m2 slot available for further expansion of storage.      Initial intended uses are to run JellyFin media server, Home Assistant and an image management app for pics, all local.      I would like full redundancy via raid1, this is where I'm a bit uncertain on approach.      I assume I'll run the OS and any apps on the NVME, not the HDD. Since i have the additional NVME slot available is there benefit to adding a second NVME drive for cache or even a mirror of the OS and apps?      Should I be looking to manage my raid with an application of some sort or in the Debian OS itself?      If the raid is setup in Debian, how does that affect future expansion? Do i have to add pairs of drives or could I for example just add a 18tb random drive?      If for example a year from now I add 2 additional drives, at that time would there be a better solution than raid1?

I've put together a NAS for my business and I was wondering if there were any alternatives to Qnap Qsync that would work with Truenas. (I also asked this in the truenas server but figured it would hurt to ask here too). The functionality in specific that I'm looking for is the ability to create users that can then establish a two way sync with the server, but similar to with Qsync, there would ideally be a smart sync that would only download what users actually need locally and not anything that isn't necessary to their work so they're not having to deal with terabytes of storage being synced.  They could then work directly on the mounted drive from their machines and anything they create will be synced to everyone and they won't have to worry about manually downloading/duplicating files on the server.      When building this I didn't realize how hard it would be to find a tool for this, and everything I've found just isn't very useful. Syncthing is not helpful, its not smart and would require everyone mirror 20tb of files (unless im misunderstanding what it does.) SMB sharing technically works but is too slow for people to work off of for our purposes as our files have huge datarates (multilayer EXR sequences, 1gb a frame kind of stuff).  I'm also experimenting with Google Workspace to see if that works any better for this but I'd figure I'd ask for help before I go down that road.      If any of you have any experience with this or could maybe point me to a client-side software that can manage client side downloads from the server in a smart way like Qsync that would be amazing.</Content></post><post><Title>Need recommendations for USB3 or eSata external drive to connect to router for FTP server.</Title><Author>u/mufasis</Author><Content>What’s going on data hoarders.

It does not store data on the servers - rather, two devices have to be online at the same time for data to be synced.

First being that wireless syncing is slow, second being that errors are more common with wireless syncing (from my experiences).      Imagine a folder and imagine that every day I make a few changes to the files within it. I need the ability to sync all the changes within the folder for 2 devices. If I do not sync them, I would have to comb the entire folder for every change and apply them one by one OR delete the folder and paste the updated folder from my PC.

Bought a 12 TB External HDD + Backblaze (Computer Backup, not B2) so I can back up my scattered external drives to the big HDD and have that backup automatically to Backblaze.      That should allow me, I hope, to finally delete files from my computer's SSD as well as my 3 other external SSDs that are all clogged up with old photos and videos. (I'm a photographer + videographer + audio engineer so I produce a lot of files —I'm out of working space and it's ruining my life!)      My issue:      I backed up 2/3 external SSDs to the big HDD about a month ago, but since then, new files have been added. I want to add only the new files to the HDD, without having to re-copy the entire folder, since I suspect that would also mess with Backblaze's file detection.  I think this means I need a file syncing and/or deduplication program.    I've seen FreeFileSync as a recommended service. Is this what I need?

Want to upgrade storage and reasonably future-proof as best as possible. Considering changing my setup from PC (Plex Media Server) + external HDD (media storage), to a mini PC (Plex) + DAS. Could use advice.    Hi, I've done some research on upgrading my current Plex / general media storage setup and I've come up with a plan that looks something like the below. Please share any constructive criticisms, tips, things I might have overlooked, etc. I want to do this right the first time around.      Use case: 1-2 simultaneous 1080p streams, most clients will be able to directly play my mostly HEVC (h.265) content without needing to transcode. Not all, though, so transcoding option is nice. I have Plex Pass so HW transcoding is also an option.      My current setup:      PC [Plex Media Server]    External Hard drive (12TB) [~10TB personal media]      What I'm thinking of moving to:      Mini PC (Beelink Mini S12) [Plex Media Server]    DAS (4-bay QNAP)      3.5 12TB HDD (shuck my current drive) [~10TB personal media]      3.5 12TB HDD (buy a new one) [RAID backup?]      empty (add a 12TB in future for more storage?)      empty (add a 12TB in future for more storage?)      If this looks good, I have a bonus question: How do I safely move my content on my current 12TB external hard drive to the DAS? Is it as simple as shucking the drive and installing in the DAS? I've also read that setting up RAID will wipe the drives; will it be necessary to buy a third 12TB drive before moving my media?

What if they never actually shared any media or websites, and instead gave a series of links to libraryofbabel.info (or similar website modified to generate random html code) which would conatain either the direct text or the source code of the designated media?      By doing this they would be able to circumvent copyright laws as anything they share would be the product of randomly generated code and they would simply be telling you where to find it as opposed to sharing the image      secondly, what if we made a website like this but for compression? Instead of needing 400mb of compressed files you could have a 2mb text file that links you to the necessary pages      TLDR instead of compressing the entire bee movie script you would only need to compress a text folder containing 1-10 of "https://libraryofbabel.info/bookmark.cgi?bee_movie_script_random)" and write a program to decrypt them</Content></post><post><Title>I know iCloud is not considered a backup but..</Title><Author>u/askinghawking</Author><Content>I know iCloud is more considered as a sync service but do you think I can use it as a backup how I do it?

This will be my first such setup and I want to KISS for the moment. Figure that (4) 12TB Reman HGST would be a good start. At Raid 5 that's approx 36TB. Or approximately 4x all my current motley collection of externals combined.

Bought a 12 TB External HDD + Backblaze (Computer Backup, not B2) so I can back up my scattered external drives to the big HDD and have that backup automatically to Backblaze.      That should allow me, I hope, to finally delete files from my computer's SSD as well as my 3 other external SSDs that are all clogged up with old photos and videos. (I'm a photographer + videographer + audio engineer so I produce a lot of files —I'm out of working space and it's ruining my life!)      My issue:      I backed up 2/3 external SSDs to the big HDD about a month ago, but since then, new files have been added. I want to add only the new files to the HDD, without having to re-copy the entire folder, since I suspect that would also mess with Backblaze's file detection.  I think this means I need a file syncing and/or deduplication program.    I've seen FreeFileSync as a recommended service. Is this what I need?

Want to upgrade storage and reasonably future-proof as best as possible. Considering changing my setup from PC (Plex Media Server) + external HDD (media storage), to a mini PC (Plex) + DAS. Could use advice.    Hi, I've done some research on upgrading my current Plex / general media storage setup and I've come up with a plan that looks something like the below. Please share any constructive criticisms, tips, things I might have overlooked, etc. I want to do this right the first time around.      Use case: 1-2 simultaneous 1080p streams, most clients will be able to directly play my mostly HEVC (h.265) content without needing to transcode. Not all, though, so transcoding option is nice. I have Plex Pass so HW transcoding is also an option.      My current setup:      PC [Plex Media Server]    External Hard drive (12TB) [~10TB personal media]      What I'm thinking of moving to:      Mini PC (Beelink Mini S12) [Plex Media Server]    DAS (4-bay QNAP)      3.5 12TB HDD (shuck my current drive) [~10TB personal media]      3.5 12TB HDD (buy a new one) [RAID backup?]      empty (add a 12TB in future for more storage?)      empty (add a 12TB in future for more storage?)      If this looks good, I have a bonus question: How do I safely move my content on my current 12TB external hard drive to the DAS? Is it as simple as shucking the drive and installing in the DAS? I've also read that setting up RAID will wipe the drives; will it be necessary to buy a third 12TB drive before moving my media?

I'd like to start by creating a weekly Wikipedia backup job to track change history.

What if they never actually shared any media or websites, and instead gave a series of links to libraryofbabel.info (or similar website modified to generate random html code) which would conatain either the direct text or the source code of the designated media?      By doing this they would be able to circumvent copyright laws as anything they share would be the product of randomly generated code and they would simply be telling you where to find it as opposed to sharing the image      secondly, what if we made a website like this but for compression? Instead of needing 400mb of compressed files you could have a 2mb text file that links you to the necessary pages      TLDR instead of compressing the entire bee movie script you would only need to compress a text folder containing 1-10 of "https://libraryofbabel.info/bookmark.cgi?bee_movie_script_random)" and write a program to decrypt them</Content></post><post><Title>Message Board Posts</Title><Author>u/Expensive_Elk_3618</Author><Content>I am trying to figure out how to download all of the message board posts in a certain category along with all of the responses.

The problem is they seem to be of varying quality almost like shucking a drive. Sometimes they're totally new, sometimes unused old stock and sometimes manufacturer refurbished.      My brother got a years old stock that had zero on power hours.      However, a review of the seller suggested the following methodology. They were reviewing a 12TB Exos      "According to my tests, this drive is legit. I was able to:      Verify the serial number at the Seagate website-  - - -    - Format the drive into 11 partitions.      Put files into the first and last 2 partitions and was able to read back the files.      Note that the drive has 11,175.98 GB of actual free space. The missing 825 GB may have been allocated to the file mapping table."      Why do you need to partition it n-1 TB times then write data on the first and last partition? Is this even sound? I think they suggested it because it's quicker and more painless than stress testing the whole drive for a legitimacy test.      EDIT. I want to clarify I know the scam of declaring high capacities using a smaller capacity medium. Also most of these drives usually have valid warranties just in a different region when checked via the their respective manufacturers website even the refurbished ones.</Content></post><post><Title>Transport 3.5" HDD with tray weekly in small casing - can't re-use packaging forever</Title><Author>u/No-Balance-8038</Author><Content>I want basically a similar small case that allows for a 3.5" with tray which is 17cm long, but as small and portable!

I have been doing this for years but lately I've been trying to streamline and speed up the process.      I have a SATA dock installed inside my system (straight SATA, no USB), and when I slot in my old 1TB Crucial MX500 drive, I can run the macrium backup in about 6 minutes.      I have lots of spare NVMe drives, so I got one of these Orico 10Gbps USB 3.2 NVMe enclosures (https://www.amazon.com/ORICO-NVMe-Thunderbolt-Compatible-SSDs-PWM2-BK/dp/B0BJ23JTXX) several months ago and it has worked fine for transferring files. However, when I run the same macrium backup as before to this NVMe drive it seems to hang for a second, then shows an estimate of 6 minutes, then within a few seconds the transfer rate drops from 1+gbps to under 100mbps and the estimated time shoots up to 55 minutes.      You would think that the symptoms point to a crappy USB enclosure or a problem with the drive... but when I copy the same image file directly from the SATA drive to the NVMe drive manually in Windows the transfer rate is pegged at over 550MB\sec (megabytes) and it is done in just over a minute.      Is there something I can adjust in Macrium or elsewhere that would fix this seeming incompatibility with this NVMe USB enclosure? I'd love to use it (to free up my old 1TB MX500) but having to wait nearly 10 times as long for backups is unacceptable.

You plug in a memory card (not specifically Sony Memory Stick. I mean like Compact Flash, SD Card, and so on), press a button, and it copies your card to a folder on the hard drive.

Is unRAID my only option if I want to start with the bare minimum and expand later on as I can afford more drives?</Content></post><post><Title>Building up my personal media server, and I have additional questions about sourcing storage</Title><Author>u/TheXypris</Author><Content>So I asked r/Plex a few days ago and got some really great advice      One of which was to send me here      So along side what I was told there I had more questions      How is shucking more affordable than just buying the regular drive? And how do I actually find those deals      Are Seagate drives really that bad?      What is the general consensus on buying drives second hand off eBay or through a liquidation auction? Bad idea or risky at best?      I'm assuming Facebook marketplace/Craigslist should be avoided, but is there any merit in looking there? Like if I find a second hand external I could shuck?      How important are RPMs sata type and all that other non capacity info? What's good and what's bad? Tradeoffs?      How long will a healthy high capacity drive realistically last? People keep saying raid is mandatory and act like drives fail because you look at them funny. I can't afford a raid array right now and anything I'm putting on it would be easily required if time consuming.      Are there price monitoring sites I can use to keep an eye out for deals or sales?

I admit i don't have much experience in video manipulation but this is turning out to be exceptionally hard.      I have around 5 movies which have 5 vob files each. The movies are around 4 hours long but around 12gb in size for barely 704x570p so i would love to concatinate and compress them.      Now here's the problem, none of the video editor software is picking up the subtitles, not handbrake, not even ffmpeg but mpv somehow plays with the subtitles, though it takes mpv 10ish seconds to load the subtitles (weird ik).      Now if i join 5 of the files to make 1 complete movie using ffmpeg, the subtitles stop loading.      I have no idea what to do :(      thanks</Content></post><post><Title>"Vimm's Lair" receives notice to remove tons of games.</Title><Author>u/blackletum</Author><Content>No content</Content></post><post><Title>10 year old Cold storage 4TB HGST drive 4 weak sectors 1200 bad sectors? User error ? Expert advice needed 🫠</Title><Author>u/Positive_Minds</Author><Content>This 4TB drive and also my 10 year old 2TB HGST drive. have popped up bad and weak sectors , they haven’t been switched on in 10 years ..      So was this basically my fault for not powering them up every and using disk fresh etc or is it just a case of age related demagnetisation or mechanical failure ? I just don’t get as most of my 10 year old western digital drives or seagate have been fine when tested after 10 years      I’m seriously thinking of doing yearly refreshes of my drives from now on .. My other question is can the weak sectors be reallocated or removed ?      I read this on super user , is this true ?      In order to keep the data signal from fading, you need to re-write the data. This is often known as “hard disk maintenance”, and should be done 3 or 4 times a year. While it does not prevent data from being corrupted or deleted, it can go a long way towards ensuring that the magnetic signal does not fade away completely. The way it works is to read every sector of the drive, and then re-write the data found there, provided the drive reported no errors. If this is done on a regular basis, the magnetic signal of every part of the drive will be refreshed long before the signal fades or becomes ambiguous. This technique also gives the drive controller the opportunity to decide whether to retire any sectors that are becoming too unreliable, before any important data is lost.      Magnetic Field Breakdown      Most sources state that permanent magnets lose their magnetic field strength at a rate of 1% per year. Assuming this is valid, after ~69 years, we can assume that half of the sectors in a hard drive would be corrupted (since they all lost half of their strength by this time). Obviously, this is quite a long time, but this risk is easily mitigated - simply re-write the data to the drive. How frequently you need to do this depends on the following two issues (I also go over this in my conclusion).      To periodically refresh the data on the drive, simply transfer it to another location, and re-writing it back to the drive. That way, the magnetic domains in the physical disk surface will be renewed with their original strength (because you just re-wrote the files back to the disk). If you're concerned about filesystem corruption, you can also format the disk before transferring the data back.      You can also help to avoid this issue by archiving your data with recovery data and error correction when you put the data onto the drive. Many archive formats support the inclusion of data recovery algorithms, so even if you have a few corrupted sectors, you can still re-build the lost data.      Depending on the priority of the data you've stored, you may want to refresh the hard disk more often. If it is essential data, I would recommend no less then 2 years at maximum. If you can withstand some chance of minor data loss (e.g. a few corrupted sectors here and there), go with 5 years. It doesn't take long to copy the data off the drive, and copy it back.      One thing not considered is the servo tracks and markings. These are written one time at the factory and never again (on modern disks). No amount of re-writes by the user or so-called low-level formatting freshens these. Once they fade, they fade!      It's different with the first stepper motor disks of the 80's. They don't have servo tracks and a low-level format writes ALL of the bits - fresh.</Content></post><post><Title>Backing up MacBook and multiple SSDs to single HDD</Title><Author>u/cloudfortynine</Author><Content>Hi everyone,      I could use some guidance as I'm unsure what the simplest and low maintenance solution is for me.

However people online had also mentioned CCC and I'm unsure how that works? I was also hoping to back this all up to a portable HDD but it seems that 8TB HDDs can only be plugged in is that true?

I only have my toe dipped in data hoarding but I've been meaning to buy the orico 6228US3 dual bay non cloning docking station.      Here is my use case:      Use my extra 3.5" 500GB HDD for my modded wii u (to be formatted for the wii u) it will be where my games are installed while running the console      back up photos, videos, school files, and game ROMs I have on future storage expansions (1-4TB at a time)      have two drives connected to my pc at the same time      on a very tight budget as a student      In the future, I would like to build my own NAS if I get into bigger data hoarding and archiving. It's something I want to do but do not have the budget for right now. I have a lot of files currently but 1 or 2 more extra drives would be enough. If I could, I'd like to own two copies of my files.      I have read some posts here on the subreddit raising issues on cooling, partitions, and corrupted drives. On cooling, would it still be an issue for a dual bay? I don't exactly understand the formatting problem of the partitions so I'd like to ask about that too. On corrupted drives, I'll always wait for the disk to stop spinning before ejection and also not move it as much as possible.      Is a dual bay docking station a good low cost entry into data hoarding or is there an alternative more appropriate for my use case?</Content></post><post><Title>A New Idea for Data Storage: Combining Piezoelectric Materials and 3D NAND</Title><Author>u/Mysterious_Crazy9606</Author><Content>Hey everyone,      I’ve been thinking about a new way to revolutionize data storage by combining piezoelectric materials with 3D NAND technology. Here’s the gist of my idea:      The Concept  •High-Speed Piezoelectric Module: Use piezoelectric crystals that can oscillate at frequencies in the gigahertz range as an ultra-fast data buffer. This could potentially give us read and write speeds way beyond what we have with current tech.•Main 3D NAND Storage: Use 3D NAND for the main long-term storage. We all know it’s reliable and has a high capacity.    How It Would Work  1.Writing Data: Incoming data would first go to the piezoelectric module at super high speeds.2.Transferring Data: The data would then be transferred to the main 3D NAND storage for long-term keeping.3.Reading Data: For reads, the system would first check the piezoelectric buffer for quick access. If the data isn’t there, it would pull from the 3D NAND storage.    Benefits  •Speed: This setup could drastically reduce latency and boost read/write speeds.•Energy Efficiency: Piezoelectric materials might be more energy-efficient for rapid operations.•New Storage Architecture: Combining the speed of piezoelectrics with the capacity of 3D NAND could create a super-efficient storage solution.    Challenges  •Tech Integration: Making sure the piezoelectric and 3D NAND components work seamlessly together.•Cost: High-quality piezoelectric materials and the complexity of this setup might be pricey.•Durability and Reliability: The materials need to handle high-frequency oscillations over long periods without wearing out.    Potential Impact      If we can make this work, it could be a game-changer for data centers, mobile devices, and industrial applications that need ultra-fast response times.      What do you all think? Could this actually work?</Content></post><post><Title>help with a complicated wget string : how do -A and -R args stack, and is there any means of boolean filtering ?</Title><Author>u/ImaginaryCheetah</Author><Content>good afternoon,      i'm not particularly familiar with wget so i'm asking the experts for assistance...      my current string of wget -A "*(USA)*zip" -R -m -p -E -k -K -np -nd -w 2 https://target works fine to pull all files with "(USA)" included in the name, but i'd like to understand if i can get more complicated.      does the -R arg work in conjunction with -A or would it override ?      for example, wget -A "*(USA)*zip" -R "*(Demo)*" [etc] would this return all files with "(USA)" in the title unless it also had "(Demo)" in the file name ?      is there any way of passing a boolean criteria through wget ?

I'm running Linux and using mdadm to run 3 arrays.      Before I attached any of my drives with data and arrays configured, I installed the card with no drives attached and update the firmware to 16.00.12.00, and made sure it was in IT mode.  As a test I then connected one of my arrays to the controller and booted the system.  After booting up, the drives were detected fine (4 x 2TB) but the array was gone.  It appears that the metadata was erased, mdadm didn't recognize any drive as being part of an array.      I was able to recover the data and the array by following the steps here:  https://raid.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/Recovering_a_damaged_RAID    However, if I reboot again the same thing happens, the metadata is lost and mdadm does not recognize that the drives are part of an array.   I do not have this issue with the older LSI controllers.      Any idea what's going on here?  When I created the array I used the entre drive, so I did not create a Linux RAID partition on each drive.  The array is configured using /dev/sda to /dev/sdd, and not /dev/sda1 to /dev/sdd1.  Not sure that has anything to do with it.      Edit:  Seems to be an issue with the controller and GPT partition tables.  As a test, I created an array with a couple 120gb SSD's I had laying around.  I created the array with the whole drive, rebooted, and after a reboot the array was still present.  I realized my other drives are configured as GPT.  So I wiped the SSDs, switched them to GPT and again created the array.  This time after a reboot the array was gone, mdadm does not recognize the drives as being part of an array.  Not sure how to fix this.</Content></post><post><Title>Buying drives from eBay?</Title><Author>u/Seventeen-Oncelers</Author><Content>I was considering buying a 10tb HDD on eBay and was wondering if this is considered a good place to buy?

I had some extra PSUs and fans and supermicro trays so I figured why not design around that. I've probably put no less than 40+ hours into design, print, redesign, print, try fitment etc. Not the most experience with Fusion360 or CAD in general. The front LEDs do light up during activity :). I've been thinking of expanding this into a mATX or Mini-ITX supported case as well.      I know this is also pretty much on the heals of shaztech_info but I think we have enough differences between us and I was kinda shocked to see someone else coming out with a similar idea around the same time lol. Let me know what you fellas and fellettes think!      From Makerworld:      I was unable to find a product that met my specifications of 8 hot-swap bays, a SAS backplane and external SAS connectors for easy connectivity, so I decided to design and build my own 8-bay Direct Attached Storage (DAS). This DAS features a Supermicro SAS833TQ backplane with Gen 5.5 hot-swap 3.5" trays. It is powered by either a 200W PWS-203-1H (as-shown) or a 350W PWS-351-1H (or similar units of the same dimensions: PWS-351-1H 100 x 40 x 220mm, PWS-203-1H 76 x 40.3 x 192mm) power supply. Additionally, it includes an external SAS SFF-8088 to SFF-8087 adapter to cut down on internal wires.      I printed this on my X1C and have realized that making it available for smaller print beds should also be done instead of 1 large single print.      The body is 255 W x 190 H x 245mm D, it is printed as a single print, no supports needed. The body at 10% infill, 2 walls with gyroid infill .20mm layer height with a 0.4mm nozzle. This print requires NO supports to print. The print of the body will use approximately 984.5g of filament if no painting is done of the logo or numbers, and 982.6g if painted of a single color. This print took roughly 20 hours to print. I realize this might also be a turn off being a large print but I wasn't wanting to have to glue or screw it together if I could help it. If you are wanting this, let me know and I can work it into a new version. There are 2 version of the back plate for the different sizes of PSUs mentioned.

I admit i don't have much experience in video manipulation but this is turning out to be exceptionally hard.      I have around 5 movies which have 5 vob files each. The movies are around 4 hours long but around 12gb in size for barely 704x570p so i would love to concatinate and compress them.      Now here's the problem, none of the video editor software is picking up the subtitles, not handbrake, not even ffmpeg but mpv somehow plays with the subtitles, though it takes mpv 10ish seconds to load the subtitles (weird ik).      Now if i join 5 of the files to make 1 complete movie using ffmpeg, the subtitles stop loading.      I have no idea what to do :(      thanks</Content></post><post><Title>"Vimm's Lair" receives notice to remove tons of games.</Title><Author>u/blackletum</Author><Content>No content</Content></post><post><Title>10 year old Cold storage 4TB HGST drive 4 weak sectors 1200 bad sectors? User error ? Expert advice needed 🫠</Title><Author>u/Positive_Minds</Author><Content>This 4TB drive and also my 10 year old 2TB HGST drive. have popped up bad and weak sectors , they haven’t been switched on in 10 years ..      So was this basically my fault for not powering them up every and using disk fresh etc or is it just a case of age related demagnetisation or mechanical failure ? I just don’t get as most of my 10 year old western digital drives or seagate have been fine when tested after 10 years      I’m seriously thinking of doing yearly refreshes of my drives from now on .. My other question is can the weak sectors be reallocated or removed ?      I read this on super user , is this true ?      In order to keep the data signal from fading, you need to re-write the data. This is often known as “hard disk maintenance”, and should be done 3 or 4 times a year. While it does not prevent data from being corrupted or deleted, it can go a long way towards ensuring that the magnetic signal does not fade away completely. The way it works is to read every sector of the drive, and then re-write the data found there, provided the drive reported no errors. If this is done on a regular basis, the magnetic signal of every part of the drive will be refreshed long before the signal fades or becomes ambiguous. This technique also gives the drive controller the opportunity to decide whether to retire any sectors that are becoming too unreliable, before any important data is lost.      Magnetic Field Breakdown      Most sources state that permanent magnets lose their magnetic field strength at a rate of 1% per year. Assuming this is valid, after ~69 years, we can assume that half of the sectors in a hard drive would be corrupted (since they all lost half of their strength by this time). Obviously, this is quite a long time, but this risk is easily mitigated - simply re-write the data to the drive. How frequently you need to do this depends on the following two issues (I also go over this in my conclusion).      To periodically refresh the data on the drive, simply transfer it to another location, and re-writing it back to the drive. That way, the magnetic domains in the physical disk surface will be renewed with their original strength (because you just re-wrote the files back to the disk). If you're concerned about filesystem corruption, you can also format the disk before transferring the data back.      You can also help to avoid this issue by archiving your data with recovery data and error correction when you put the data onto the drive. Many archive formats support the inclusion of data recovery algorithms, so even if you have a few corrupted sectors, you can still re-build the lost data.      Depending on the priority of the data you've stored, you may want to refresh the hard disk more often. If it is essential data, I would recommend no less then 2 years at maximum. If you can withstand some chance of minor data loss (e.g. a few corrupted sectors here and there), go with 5 years. It doesn't take long to copy the data off the drive, and copy it back.      One thing not considered is the servo tracks and markings. These are written one time at the factory and never again (on modern disks). No amount of re-writes by the user or so-called low-level formatting freshens these. Once they fade, they fade!      It's different with the first stepper motor disks of the 80's. They don't have servo tracks and a low-level format writes ALL of the bits - fresh.</Content></post><post><Title>Backing up MacBook and multiple SSDs to single HDD</Title><Author>u/cloudfortynine</Author><Content>Hi everyone,      I could use some guidance as I'm unsure what the simplest and low maintenance solution is for me.

I only have my toe dipped in data hoarding but I've been meaning to buy the orico 6228US3 dual bay non cloning docking station.      Here is my use case:      Use my extra 3.5" 500GB HDD for my modded wii u (to be formatted for the wii u) it will be where my games are installed while running the console      back up photos, videos, school files, and game ROMs I have on future storage expansions (1-4TB at a time)      have two drives connected to my pc at the same time      on a very tight budget as a student      In the future, I would like to build my own NAS if I get into bigger data hoarding and archiving. It's something I want to do but do not have the budget for right now. I have a lot of files currently but 1 or 2 more extra drives would be enough. If I could, I'd like to own two copies of my files.      I have read some posts here on the subreddit raising issues on cooling, partitions, and corrupted drives. On cooling, would it still be an issue for a dual bay? I don't exactly understand the formatting problem of the partitions so I'd like to ask about that too. On corrupted drives, I'll always wait for the disk to stop spinning before ejection and also not move it as much as possible.      Is a dual bay docking station a good low cost entry into data hoarding or is there an alternative more appropriate for my use case?</Content></post><post><Title>A New Idea for Data Storage: Combining Piezoelectric Materials and 3D NAND</Title><Author>u/Mysterious_Crazy9606</Author><Content>Hey everyone,      I’ve been thinking about a new way to revolutionize data storage by combining piezoelectric materials with 3D NAND technology. Here’s the gist of my idea:      The Concept  •High-Speed Piezoelectric Module: Use piezoelectric crystals that can oscillate at frequencies in the gigahertz range as an ultra-fast data buffer. This could potentially give us read and write speeds way beyond what we have with current tech.•Main 3D NAND Storage: Use 3D NAND for the main long-term storage. We all know it’s reliable and has a high capacity.    How It Would Work  1.Writing Data: Incoming data would first go to the piezoelectric module at super high speeds.2.Transferring Data: The data would then be transferred to the main 3D NAND storage for long-term keeping.3.Reading Data: For reads, the system would first check the piezoelectric buffer for quick access. If the data isn’t there, it would pull from the 3D NAND storage.    Benefits  •Speed: This setup could drastically reduce latency and boost read/write speeds.•Energy Efficiency: Piezoelectric materials might be more energy-efficient for rapid operations.•New Storage Architecture: Combining the speed of piezoelectrics with the capacity of 3D NAND could create a super-efficient storage solution.    Challenges  •Tech Integration: Making sure the piezoelectric and 3D NAND components work seamlessly together.•Cost: High-quality piezoelectric materials and the complexity of this setup might be pricey.•Durability and Reliability: The materials need to handle high-frequency oscillations over long periods without wearing out.    Potential Impact      If we can make this work, it could be a game-changer for data centers, mobile devices, and industrial applications that need ultra-fast response times.      What do you all think? Could this actually work?</Content></post><post><Title>help with a complicated wget string : how do -A and -R args stack, and is there any means of boolean filtering ?</Title><Author>u/ImaginaryCheetah</Author><Content>good afternoon,      i'm not particularly familiar with wget so i'm asking the experts for assistance...      my current string of wget -A "*(USA)*zip" -R -m -p -E -k -K -np -nd -w 2 https://target works fine to pull all files with "(USA)" included in the name, but i'd like to understand if i can get more complicated.      does the -R arg work in conjunction with -A or would it override ?      for example, wget -A "*(USA)*zip" -R "*(Demo)*" [etc] would this return all files with "(USA)" in the title unless it also had "(Demo)" in the file name ?      is there any way of passing a boolean criteria through wget ?

Are there any organizations out there that have transcribed some of our more important items into stone or clay? I've been looking more into Sumerian history and the reason we have many of these items still is because they were carved into clay - and clay can last a pretty long time.

I'm running Linux and using mdadm to run 3 arrays.      Before I attached any of my drives with data and arrays configured, I installed the card with no drives attached and update the firmware to 16.00.12.00, and made sure it was in IT mode.  As a test I then connected one of my arrays to the controller and booted the system.  After booting up, the drives were detected fine (4 x 2TB) but the array was gone.  It appears that the metadata was erased, mdadm didn't recognize any drive as being part of an array.      I was able to recover the data and the array by following the steps here:  https://raid.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/Recovering_a_damaged_RAID    However, if I reboot again the same thing happens, the metadata is lost and mdadm does not recognize that the drives are part of an array.   I do not have this issue with the older LSI controllers.      Any idea what's going on here?  When I created the array I used the entre drive, so I did not create a Linux RAID partition on each drive.  The array is configured using /dev/sda to /dev/sdd, and not /dev/sda1 to /dev/sdd1.  Not sure that has anything to do with it.      Edit:  Seems to be an issue with the controller and GPT partition tables.  As a test, I created an array with a couple 120gb SSD's I had laying around.  I created the array with the whole drive, rebooted, and after a reboot the array was still present.  I realized my other drives are configured as GPT.  So I wiped the SSDs, switched them to GPT and again created the array.  This time after a reboot the array was gone, mdadm does not recognize the drives as being part of an array.  Not sure how to fix this.</Content></post><post><Title>Buying drives from eBay?</Title><Author>u/Seventeen-Oncelers</Author><Content>I was considering buying a 10tb HDD on eBay and was wondering if this is considered a good place to buy?

I had some extra PSUs and fans and supermicro trays so I figured why not design around that. I've probably put no less than 40+ hours into design, print, redesign, print, try fitment etc. Not the most experience with Fusion360 or CAD in general. The front LEDs do light up during activity :). I've been thinking of expanding this into a mATX or Mini-ITX supported case as well.      I know this is also pretty much on the heals of shaztech_info but I think we have enough differences between us and I was kinda shocked to see someone else coming out with a similar idea around the same time lol. Let me know what you fellas and fellettes think!      From Makerworld:      I was unable to find a product that met my specifications of 8 hot-swap bays, a SAS backplane and external SAS connectors for easy connectivity, so I decided to design and build my own 8-bay Direct Attached Storage (DAS). This DAS features a Supermicro SAS833TQ backplane with Gen 5.5 hot-swap 3.5" trays. It is powered by either a 200W PWS-203-1H (as-shown) or a 350W PWS-351-1H (or similar units of the same dimensions: PWS-351-1H 100 x 40 x 220mm, PWS-203-1H 76 x 40.3 x 192mm) power supply. Additionally, it includes an external SAS SFF-8088 to SFF-8087 adapter to cut down on internal wires.      I printed this on my X1C and have realized that making it available for smaller print beds should also be done instead of 1 large single print.      The body is 255 W x 190 H x 245mm D, it is printed as a single print, no supports needed. The body at 10% infill, 2 walls with gyroid infill .20mm layer height with a 0.4mm nozzle. This print requires NO supports to print. The print of the body will use approximately 984.5g of filament if no painting is done of the logo or numbers, and 982.6g if painted of a single color. This print took roughly 20 hours to print. I realize this might also be a turn off being a large print but I wasn't wanting to have to glue or screw it together if I could help it. If you are wanting this, let me know and I can work it into a new version. There are 2 version of the back plate for the different sizes of PSUs mentioned.

I managed to find a Fractal design R5 with all drive sleds still there and thought it would make a great NAS Chassi. But now I'm wondering, do I need a NAS or can I just move my PC components there and just have a PC with 30+TB of space? All of the other people on the network don't have much data to store and would rather I help them anyway to save things. What other reasons would there be to have my data storage in a seperate chassi?</Content></post><post><Title>My home backup method is bad. I need help re-thinking it.</Title><Author>u/Zach83</Author><Content>I don't know a lot about networking, storage, and proper backing up. I'm a 3d artist and do some coding on the side so I don't get scared by technical manuals or learning new tech, but proper sys adminning is not my strength.I just did some reading on things like windows backup and mirroring and now I think I need to update/change/modernize how I backup my stuff.Apparently the things I am relying on are NOT reliable at all.So I dove in and now I can't see the forest for the trees anymore. I need help thinking this out.  My current setupI have a work/gaming pc with 2 2TB drives and a synology 1 disk(2TB) NAS device.The windows PC contains important data, the NAS serves media to a media pc(that needs no backing up) and some tablets      To back these up I have a windows based "NAS" with 2 mirrored volumes, F and G. 2 4TB volumes (so 4 disks, 4TB each, 2 used for each mirorred volume)On the Work PC there are three folders that I manually backup to G while working. Daily backups sort off.Every week I run a Bat file with a few robocopy commands on the windows "NAS". The BAT maps the work PC's drives and the synology NAS drive and then does a copy with options like /mir and /purge. Essentially an incremental backup of the NAS and work PC drives to the windows "NAS".      A few times a year a I run a second bat script. It copies everything to external devices that I store in my shed. Best offsite backup available to me.  my questionsHow to mirror?Apparently windows mirrored volumes can not be relied on? I use it to protect against disk failure and apparently there are situations where the still working disk will NOT be read by another windows pc. Kinda defeats the point.I want such protection on the windows "NAS", an automatic and fast mirror copy.I want to be able to put any disk of the mirror pair in any other windows pc and have it appear like a normal disk, so it should be NTFS.What should I do? There are so many options and I have no idea what is reliable.  How to backup without Robocopy (in a file system that windows can read like ntfs, and without puting files into a proprietary binary blob)?I'm told I shouldn't use Robocopy for incremental backups because it's too easy to fuck up, and should power cut out while copying I could be fucked.Googling I went, searching for a way with the following requirements:      I want to backup the synology nas and the 2 disks on the work pc weekly, to the windows "NAS".      I only want to copy changed or new files and I want to remove files that no longer exist in the original source.      The backup should not go into a binary blob, I want loose files.      No need for file versions/history.      Timestamps(date modifed/created) are important to me.      And I found nothing. I probably don't even know the right terms to search for.How should I do this backup?      Ideally this should not involve signing up for a service or managed via a web interface hosted by some company. I want to keep everything in home and away from the internet.Free would be nice too.</Content></post><post><Title>Any good suggestions for hardware to transfer analogue camcorder footage to a computer?</Title><Author>u/Zazabar11</Author><Content>My camcorder has av out and I have cables going from the camcorder to a framemister, which converts the signal to digital and uses an HDMI cable to transfer the signal to an elgato hd 60s, which ends with a USB C cable going to my computer for capture. It's a bit, but it has worked for older VHS tapes pretty well. I'm also using the basic capture software which comes with the elgato software.      While trying to get footage from my camcorder, I noticed the audio and video footage stops getting captured on my PC when the tracking gets real messy, even if only for a couple seconds, and it ruins lots of the tape.      Any suggestions for a capturing device which can handle any sort of tracking that may be required by the tapes?      To note, I'm using a Sony CCD-TRV57, which uses VHS-C tapes (they're a compact form of regular VHS tapes).</Content></post><post><Title>winhttrack problem with cloning a single landing page.

The drives have just ticked over the 40,000 (grim dark) power-on time. Given that all the drives where purchased and installed at the same time, I'm worried about one crapping out and causing a domino effect when I get the replacement in to rebuild the array.      The drives are Seagate ST6000VN0033 drives, health status shows as good on all counts. Just wondering when you guys start to consider replacement or migration to a new NAS (which is what I'd probably do).</Content></post><post><Title>Advice/guidance needed for a first time NAS builder</Title><Author>u/de4thr4sher</Author><Content>Hello everyone! I've been lurking around here for quite some time and all I'll say is that I've been inspired by your posts so much that I've decided to dive into the realm of building my first NAS and be a data hoarder myself. But I'll need your help with that as I've been very confused with a lot of things and obviously, I don't want to screw everything up.      So, first things first. My intention with the setup is purely just hoarding data on a separate machine other than my main PC while i keep everything safe and secure as much as possible. I don't need it to be accessible from anywhere or anything like that, just locally from my main PC. Like an enormous external HDD to put it simply. I don't need crazy speeds either as I won't be using it for work or anything similar. It's main use will be storing and playing my audio/video files from there and ofc, store a lot of other files and having backups of my main system and other devices.      I'll be starting with the hardware I already own and the ones I plan on buying (suggestions are welcome ofc)      *Already owned hardware*      Option 1 for mobo/CPU/RAM would be my old setup:      A Z390-E paired with a 9700k (8C/8T) and 32GB (DDR4-3000) of RAM      Option 2 would be a setup I got recently for free:      An Asus ROG Maximus VII paired with a 4790k (4C/8T) and 16GB (DDR3-1600).      A 700W Coolermaster PSU that I also got with the free setup, an old spare Kingston SSDNow V300 240GB and if I manage to finally build this NAS, I'll be getting rid of a 4TB WD drive and an 8TB Ironwolf drive.      Will I have to use the 9700k setup in this case or even the 4790k will be enough?      *Hardware I plan on buying*      The goal for now is to get 4 drives so I can have 2 of them for redundancy and add another 4 next year and hopefully I won't have a storage issue for a long time.      I've locked my eyes on Exos X16 14TB and on X18 16TB drives and a Define 7 XL R2 case for this whole setup as all these are in a fairly good price right now where I'm from. Seagate lists these drives as CMR so I guess shouldn't be concerned...? Later on I know I'll also have to get a Pci-e to 4x sata or something like that.      That's about it as far as hardware goes. Let's dive into software now, shall we?      The most confusing part for me and where I need your advice the most. What should I go for?      I see a lot of people recommending unRAID for basic setups like this. I got very confused when I was trying to decide between that or TrueNAS and eventually I gave it up and decided to ask the experts here. What would you do? Is it worth spending extra for an unRAID licence?      I know this post is stupid for 99.8% of you but it's obviously not my field of expertise and I'm trying to not spend anywhere else right now, except mainly for HDDs and a case.      Suggestions AND roasts are welcome! :) Thanks in advance!</Content></post><post><Title>How much would it cost me to have and maintain a 1 TB database?</Title><Author>u/AtwoodEnterprise</Author><Content>I have an SEO SaaS and I store a lot of data for keywords and backlinks.      My database is about 50gb and I’m currently paying about $80/mo for my webhosting VPS and up to 75gb of database storage.      Currently, I use a lot of API’s to pull SEO data down because it’s such a hassle to store that much data, but over the next year I want to try and up my game a bit.      So I’m gonna try and start off by increasing my keyword, and my backlink data to around 1 TB total if possible. The majority of the data is gonna be due to the backlink data of course.      Would anyone have any estimates for how much something like this might cost?

storage guide for a highschooler</Title><Author>u/MintedMince</Author><Content>Hi! So I am a highschooler from a third world country and recently I have been struggling to keep all of my data intact. I have been juggling around 1 or 2 spare hard-drives and google accounts to somehow store family photos and other important media with as many backups as I can make.

Now, since I am over USB 10Gbps, I am limited in both scenarios, but I'd like to know if that faster and more cache of the 9271 will actually make a difference for a domestic usage.

It was over +100°F (+38°C) degrees today and the sun was beaming directly on the mailbox for 4 hours before I got to it. I suspected the box could have easily been 130°F (55°C) or possibly much hotter having been in the direct sunlight for so long. I immediately put the entire box in the refrigerator. After about 5 minutes in the fridge, I decided to measure the temp using a digital BBQ thermometer. It measured at 104°F (40°C) but this was likely not accurate because I was using a thermometer that is meant to be shoved inside of meat and the box had already been in the fridge for 5 mins.      How much damage could have been caused from it sitting in the direct +100°F (+38°C) degree sunlight for just over 4 hours?

Lsyncd, DRDB or Kopia backup</Title><Author>u/1000Zebras</Author><Content>Hi,      I'm curious what you guys would implement in this situation in order to, above all, simply maintain at the very least one solid, off-site backup of all of my data files and also, in the event of something happening to my main data drive on-site, reduce downtime as much as possible.      Here is my current setup as is relevant to the question at hand:      OrangePi 5 Plus running dietpi (so pretty much just debian) as my main server on-site      One eMMC boot drive on the OrangePi containing the OS and all of my docker-compose files, as well as the OS itself      Recently acquired 14TB external USB drive that houses purely my data for all of my docker containers (and then some outside of those, as well, but not much)      OrangePi is running Tailscale      A second RPi that lives at my brother's house also running Tailscale (so any connection between the two will more than likely be running over the interwebs, but through Tailscale) and with a second 14tb drive identical to the other connected to it, ready for data storage      What I'm wondering is what may be the best strategy for maintaining a backup of the main data drive on the secondary drive, ideally in a mirrored fashion such that were the main drive to fail, I'd simply be able to plug in the secondary drive to the OrangePi, mount it at the same mountpoint as primary would have been, and I'd be back up and running nearly immediately (once the drive was physically moved between locations, of course).      It's worth noting that, at present, I am dealing with nearly 4.5TB of data on main data drive (also currently backed up to the cloud via Kopia and iDrive E2)      I've been considering:      Trying out lsyncd or DRDB in order to literally have the drives mirror each other in as near realtime as the connection will allow. I have not used either of these tools yet, however, so I'm not familiar with exactly how they work behind the scene. And also, I realize that it is a lot of data to keep in sync over an internet connection, especially at file or block-level granularity as I believe those tools are designed for. In "normal" usage, I am not necessarily adding or changing all that much data on a day to day basis, but were I to make any major shifts in organization, or simply to add a lot more data into the mix suddenly, I'm wondering if the tools would be able to keep up      Running an rsync job over ssh at a specified interval (say, maybe, a couple of times a day) in order to keep the two up date. I would of course again run into the same problem that would arise with the first option were I to make any drastic changes, but theoretically I'd eventually always have a 1 to 1 sync/backup between the two drives      Simply running some sort of backup program from the main Orangepi data drive to the RPi's data drive, again at whatever specified interval (say, maybe, daily). I'd probably have to run some sort of webDAV server on the secondary RPi in order to facilitate backups between the two were I to use Kopia. Or, I suppose I could even run the data drive on RPi on a minio instance and have Kopia backup via the S3 protocol, but this seems perhaps like a little bit of overkill, and it wouldn't necessarily be the sort of 1 to 1 sync I'm shooting for as Kopia would organize the backup data in a fashion that it understands. This would be acceptable, though, as again at the end of the day the most important thing is to have all of the data itself stored safely in both locations, one way or another.      How would you guys go about keeping things in sync between the two data drives? Or, should I just eschew that idea given the limitations of the bandwidth/connection between the two and go for straight backups using Kopia, or some othe rbackup system?      Please, if you have any thoughts on how you'd architect this scenario, I'd very much appreciate any and perspectives/insights.      Hopefully that all makes sense. If you need anything clarified, by all means speak up and I'll do my best to address.      Thank you so very much for your time, expertise, and patience with my rambling question. I look forward to hearing how people weigh in.

I'm late to the party on this but I thought if there are some people already on the case then maybe users from this subreddit might be interested in finding them to help with backups and hosting.      The NOAA is shutting down some of their online and printed services and they are removing that data from their websites. This project actually began in 2021 and is set to be completed in 2025.  So what is the RNC?    NOAA's RNC Tile Service (WMTS)      The NOAA RNC Tile Service provides standardized nautical chart tilesets for the public, eliminating the need for application developers to regularly undergo the cumbersome process of transforming NOAA BSB files into tilesets. It provides geo-referenced charts compatible with the Web Map Tile Specifications (WMTS) and Tile Map Service Specification (TMS). All tilesets are published on a weekly basis.      Original website (already deleted?): https://tileservice.charts.noaa.gov    Their annoucement:      NOAA will shut down its Raster Navigational Chart (RNC) Tile Service and the online RNC Viewer on October 1, 2021. The NOAA Seamless Raster Navigational Chart Services will be shut down on January 1, 2022. This is part of a larger NOAA program to end production and maintenance of all NOAA traditional paper and raster nautical charts that was announced in the Federal Register in November 2019.      Cancellation of traditional NOAA paper nautical charts and associated raster nautical chart products, such as BookletCharts™ and Raster Navigational Charts (RNC) will occur over the next four years and be completed by January 2025. More information about this overarching program to “sunset” traditional  nautical chart products is available on the “Farewell to Traditional Nautical Charts” web page.      -- sourceWhy help with this project?    The abandoned nautical tilesets and paper charts have been replaced with GIS offerings for modern equipment, however these older documents were a failsafe for smaller vessels and operations.

I've used few file restoration programs, and managed to salvage about 80% of everything that was on the drive, but the problem is, like 70% of what I've restored is either corrupted, or doesn't have audio. And all the files were put into ~75 different folders, with around 900 or so files each.I'd like to sort out the files with audio and without, in order to save the good ones and get rid of the bad ones.All files were renamed to random letters and numbers by recovery software, so the corrupted and muted files are basically completely useless to me, since I can't even use the file names to find out what files those are.      All the files are either .mp4, .mkv, .avi, .mov or .wmv.      Sorting through tens of thousands of files would take me months, and I just don't have the time or patience to do that. I've had the idea of importing files into video editing soft like Premiere and look at the generated waveform to find out good files,  but there's quite a lot of files with codecs unsupported by Premiere, like VP09 and such, so vast majority of files, even with audio present show up as flat lines on Premiere waveform, thus this method is completely useless to me. Like, importing a folder of restored files only generates maybe 20-30 waveforms, the rest are flat lines, and so manual sorting is still required.

Not knowing about the data formatting situation, I backed up all my data from my old laptop onto my Seagate Expansion Portable Drive 2TB. When using my MacBook, I noticed I couldn't upload files to this harddrive because the file formatting was different.      I found on the internet that to switch the external harddrive from NTFS to APFS I can use Disk Utility to reformat the device. For this to happen however i have to backup the files that I have on my external harddrive, because to reformat it the harddrive has to be erased.      The thing is, if i back-up the files to my old HP Omen, I can't reupload the files back to my external hard drive because it has been reformatted to APFS, and the files are NTFS. I also can't back-up the files to my new MacBook, because the size of my files is way to big for the internal storage of my Macbook!      Is the only option for this really just to buy another external harddrive coded to APFS, or keep my files on my hard drive on my old dusty laptop that barely functions? This feels like a catch-22 situation to me.      Sorry if this question has a) been answered already or b) is not relevant to this subreddit. Any help is appreciated!</Content></post><post><Title>NAS nvme build options</Title><Author>u/AHappyGaijin</Author><Content>Hello, i am currently building my first NAS using a Topton N100 board.      Im currently deciding on which nvme to use as a system drive - currently leaning for a WD Blue SN580 2Tb. My question is if one should get 2 of the same drive to mirror the operating System?      Using 2 nvme drives would limit the pcie expansion possibility of the board because the second nvme slot shares lanes with the nvme slot.

Travel a lot, so it has to be as convenient and compact as a Flash thumb drive. I saw plenty of recommendations of using NVMe + enclosure for portable consumer storage.

Also the Crucial X6..  https://www.amazon.com/SSK-Portable-External-MacBook-Laptops/dp/B0CL94LX9W?ref_=ast_sto_dp&amp;amp;th=1What are the pros and cons?

I wonder if it is worth using the "wayback machine" and "archive.ph" addons for archiving random websites when you are navigating across the internet.      Sometimes I focus on old websites (*index.html or other dork commands). Other times, it is local news in my surroundings. And from time to time, websites in minority languages. I don't save locally in large quantities. Do you think this strategy is worth it?      Sometimes it is like planting a forest.

I'm looking to backup a zpool of media. I had tried to setup a truenas for the data but I didn't love the UI and I have what I need on Ubuntu with docker. My plan is to destroy a zpool of the truenas made of 4x10tb raidz1 and move that pool into the primary server (add a pcie with more sata ports) then use zpool attach to mirror my current 4x8tb raidz1 (mnt) to the newly recreated zpool of the 4x10tb from the old truenas server (named mntbackup). So zpool attach mnt to mntbackup. Sounds like this automatically starts mirroring.      I know this isn't ideal without being an off-site backup but I'm not the most literate at actually managing this and want something easy. Would I be able to just plug in backup, then unplug the backup pool and cold storage? I don't need perfect redundancy. Would I be able to plug the mntbackup raidz1 back in sometime in the future and the missing new data automatically sync or would I need scripts of rysnc or zfs send receive to add new data?

For this reason there are some real issues with the loads on the electrical circuits between my network storage, gaming PC, HTPCs and so on.  Plus just 'physical space' and noise limitations.      As such, when my 16 drive UnRAID server ran out of drive slots, the only solution was to build a second server which is in the Livingroom, in a 4U Rosewill case, sitting discretely in an Ikea Lack table with caster wheels.  The main server has a Ryzen 9 3950X and does all the dockers and stuff.  The secondary server has an Intel E5 2697v2 and sits there eating electricity for the sake of letting me run 12 more drives.      But we're moving!  Three floors!  Gonna run ethernet in all the walls.  There will be a finished basement area for 'the gaming goodness' and I can finally set up network and storage in a real rack, on the unfinished side of the basement, with it's own 15amp circuit and where no one will care how much noise anything in there makes.  That means I an get disk shelf and make all of this way less stupid!      The main plan is to retire the server inside the 4U rack case, then transplant the main tower server into that 4U rack case and expand it's drive capacity with a disk shelf.  So here's where I have questions:      Firstly, things like the NetApp DS4246 and related seem to be what I'm looking at.  All my drives are SATA, to these disk shelves support SATA out of the box, is additional hardware required for SATA drives, or do I need to look for something alternate/specific?      Secondly, these shelves offer up to four PSUs for redundancy, but how many are needed at minimum assuming 'up time' is not a major concern?  Also what kind of power consumption should I see beyond the drives it's powering?  I should def see an advantage over a whole 11 year old Xeon running, right?      Thirdly, for the 'host server' to access this kind of disk shelf, I should only require something like an LSI 9201-16E and a quartet of 8088 to SFF-8088 cables, right?  From there on, the host device should just have an LSI controller which see's up to 24 drives on it, and it's all happy and 'just works'?</Content></post><post><Title>Any Software Recommendations for Folder Sync that Works on Top of Existing OS?</Title><Author>u/avattz</Author><Content>I almost had a data loss scare yesterday with a Windows machine, luckily I managed to restore it, but this has lead to figuring out a file sync system for my machines in case one has an issue with the boot drive or hardware failure. I currently have a small RAID 1 file server running Samba and while I manually copy files from my computers to this server, I wanted to see if there was software that could automated this.      The goal is for this software to automatically copy a new completed file placed in the documents folder to a  network drive that is available on the same computer. Literally "copy this file over there when it exists". I looked into FreeFileSync and Syncthing but these appear to sync directly to a server instead to a local folder.      One additional thing I an looking for is two-way syncing. This way, I can make a "universal" document folders where all my computers will have the same content, and update them if they are missing anything. This could count as additional backup since I would have the same files over many computers.      Does anyone have recommendations for a software solution?      Preferably:      Open source      "Live" syncing (runs when new or changed file detected instead of scheduled syncing)      Flexible / Plenty of Options / Configurable      Uses native Windows file commands      Doesn't hurt, but works on Linux (I have "better" options for my Linux machines though)      I appreciate any recommendations!      Edit: I remember SyncToy which would be perfect, if anyone knows of an open source version of SyncToy, then that would be what I am looking for!</Content></post><post><Title>Video upscaling 480p to 1080 ffmpeg</Title><Author>u/1michaelbrown</Author><Content>The title pretty much explains what I’m asking.

Some backstory: I had an unfortunate ssd failure which cost me about $1000 to recover the files. After some research I've decided to set up a NAS w/ RAID1 (and other back up methods). Now I have some questions to help me transition/transfer/migration from my old external hdd setup to my NAS solution.      My first question mainly revolves around keeping file integrity when transferring files. What programs are best at doing this? I've done some research and I've currently chosen TeraCopy. It looks pretty good; other posts have suggested stuff like Robocopy but I couldn't find/get it to work (maybe it's command line stuff that, though I admittedly didn't look too hard since I don't trust inbuilt windows stuff that much). How good is TeraCopy and its file integrity verification?      My second question is about checking files for corruption, mainly videos. This one is a bit of a shot in the dark, a hail mary hope of mine that I can fix this headache inducing rookie mistake of mine. Long story short, I had to reinitialize my NAS due to changing its setup. When doing this, I copied data I had on the NAS to a ext HDD (no verification done, I now know it was a stupid rookie mistake) totaling approx 3.5 TB of data, mainly video files (probably around 1k hours). Now I found at least 1 of them has a bit of corruption, where about 20 seconds got messed up. Is there a way or program that can find these kind of problems with files? I'm guessing probably not, but if there are potential solutions I'd love to find them. Otherwise, I guess those errors/problems will just exist and years later I'll find out and lament that if I knew years ago I could have replaced those files but not when I do.

Stupid me. It was a full format, not a quick format, but I stopped it only a second or two after it had started. I ran testdisk to check the damages and try to recover the files; it didn't really work all too well. I tried to run photorec, but the software is unusable - my input was randomized and would constantly change if it even accepted input at all; this wasn't a mapping issue, as the right arrow key would act as arrow up, enter, arrow down, or any other random input at any given time. Either way, I eventually found and ran R-Studio's R-Linux, which seemed to work fine, if a little unintuitive. I ran the software and seemingly recovered a lot of files; among others, I recovered a lot of mp4 files. This was expected, as the drive was filled almost exclusively with videos. However, R-Linux does not have built in capabilities to recover webms or other video file formats like qt, and I know there were a great deal of those files on the drive. Does anyone know of any good ways to recover those files as well?      I know R-Linux has the ability to add custom file types by building an xml file for that type.

From there on, the host device should just have an LSI controller which see's up to 24 drives on it, and it's all happy and 'just works'?</Content></post><post><Title>Any Software Recommendations for Folder Sync that Works on Top of Existing OS?</Title><Author>u/avattz</Author><Content>I almost had a data loss scare yesterday with a Windows machine, luckily I managed to restore it, but this has lead to figuring out a file sync system for my machines in case one has an issue with the boot drive or hardware failure. I currently have a small RAID 1 file server running Samba and while I manually copy files from my computers to this server, I wanted to see if there was software that could automated this.      The goal is for this software to automatically copy a new completed file placed in the documents folder to a  network drive that is available on the same computer. Literally "copy this file over there when it exists". I looked into FreeFileSync and Syncthing but these appear to sync directly to a server instead to a local folder.      One additional thing I an looking for is two-way syncing. This way, I can make a "universal" document folders where all my computers will have the same content, and update them if they are missing anything. This could count as additional backup since I would have the same files over many computers.      Does anyone have recommendations for a software solution?      Preferably:      Open source      "Live" syncing (runs when new or changed file detected instead of scheduled syncing)      Flexible / Plenty of Options / Configurable      Uses native Windows file commands      Doesn't hurt, but works on Linux (I have "better" options for my Linux machines though)      I appreciate any recommendations!      Edit: I remember SyncToy which would be perfect, if anyone knows of an open source version of SyncToy, then that would be what I am looking for!</Content></post><post><Title>Video upscaling 480p to 1080 ffmpeg</Title><Author>u/1michaelbrown</Author><Content>The title pretty much explains what I’m asking.

Some backstory: I had an unfortunate ssd failure which cost me about $1000 to recover the files. After some research I've decided to set up a NAS w/ RAID1 (and other back up methods). Now I have some questions to help me transition/transfer/migration from my old external hdd setup to my NAS solution.      My first question mainly revolves around keeping file integrity when transferring files. What programs are best at doing this? I've done some research and I've currently chosen TeraCopy. It looks pretty good; other posts have suggested stuff like Robocopy but I couldn't find/get it to work (maybe it's command line stuff that, though I admittedly didn't look too hard since I don't trust inbuilt windows stuff that much). How good is TeraCopy and its file integrity verification?      My second question is about checking files for corruption, mainly videos. This one is a bit of a shot in the dark, a hail mary hope of mine that I can fix this headache inducing rookie mistake of mine. Long story short, I had to reinitialize my NAS due to changing its setup. When doing this, I copied data I had on the NAS to a ext HDD (no verification done, I now know it was a stupid rookie mistake) totaling approx 3.5 TB of data, mainly video files (probably around 1k hours). Now I found at least 1 of them has a bit of corruption, where about 20 seconds got messed up. Is there a way or program that can find these kind of problems with files? I'm guessing probably not, but if there are potential solutions I'd love to find them. Otherwise, I guess those errors/problems will just exist and years later I'll find out and lament that if I knew years ago I could have replaced those files but not when I do.      Thanks for your help and I'll reply if I have any follow up questions.</Content></post><post><Title>Planning on storing txt, xlsx, and MKV files.

In an effort to cut costs, I'm trying to backup onto smaller external HDs. I've got one media library that's about 6TB that I'm trying to put onto a drive that's got an actual capacity of 4.5TB, I'm trying to rely on compression to make that work.      The issue is that I've tried with both medium and high compression but the backup always fails due to insufficient space. Does the compression happen after the backup takes place? Or am I doing something wrong?      Wasn't sure if I needed to have 6TB of space available initially, then it does some compression afterwards.

Stupid me. It was a full format, not a quick format, but I stopped it only a second or two after it had started. I ran testdisk to check the damages and try to recover the files; it didn't really work all too well. I tried to run photorec, but the software is unusable - my input was randomized and would constantly change if it even accepted input at all; this wasn't a mapping issue, as the right arrow key would act as arrow up, enter, arrow down, or any other random input at any given time. Either way, I eventually found and ran R-Studio's R-Linux, which seemed to work fine, if a little unintuitive. I ran the software and seemingly recovered a lot of files; among others, I recovered a lot of mp4 files. This was expected, as the drive was filled almost exclusively with videos. However, R-Linux does not have built in capabilities to recover webms or other video file formats like qt, and I know there were a great deal of those files on the drive. Does anyone know of any good ways to recover those files as well?      I know R-Linux has the ability to add custom file types by building an xml file for that type. I wouldn't know where to begin on getting the information for such a file, but does anyone have one that would work for the not included video file types (webm, qt, etc.)?

It has since also been upgraded to the latest firmware from LSI/Broadcom, which is 12.15.0-0239 (also the card at boot identifies as BIOS version "3.30.02.2 (Build June 17, 2014)"). I am just simply using it in my Windows 10 system, not as part of a server or NAS.      This card had been disconnected from my system for about 6-12 months, as well as it's drives, I recently reconnected everything in a new system. I have four HDDs in a RAID5, but had recently acquired the license key to enable RAID6 and had installed a 5th HDD in preparation for that. I had a few errors at first, but many things in the system were at first giving me errors so I didn't think much of it as I had performed several upgrades and changes at once.      I eventually got everything booting properly and then opened up the RAID Windows management software (Version 17.05.02.01 at the time) and it seemed to be going ok. It was performing a Patrol Read on all of my drives and was recharging the battery (Though it claimed the battery was bad, but it was new, so I figured it needed to do a recharge cycle and re-learn to see it as good again). It said the Patrol Read was only going to take 10 minutes but I knew it was going to take hours. Halfway in, at about the 3-4 hour mark, the software completely stopped responding. I restarted it, and now the card was showing that absolutely nothing was installed to it.      I performed a reboot and now I kept getting an error message during the card's initialization during post:      LSI MegaRAID SAS-MFI BIOS Version 3.30.02.2 (Build June 17, 2014) Copyright(c) 2014 LSI Corporation Host Adapter Bus 5 Dev 0:      F/W is in Fault State MFI Register State 0xF0010002      Adapter at Baseport is not responding      No MegaRAID Adapter Installed      The card then could be seen as installed, but the drives were not showing up, and the management software could not even tell a card was installed anymore. I tried updating to the latest management software (17.05.06.00) in case it might at least see there is a card installed, with that being it's own can of worms of expecting me to manually install OpenJDK and set the environment paths myself, it also just gets stuck loading the application.      I tried MegaCLI, StorCLI, and MegaSCU (I admit I am not too familiar with managing this card through a CLI) but -v and -AdpAllInfo -aALL but they all returned nothing. I tried disconnecting the drives in case one had somehow become so fault during storage that it was crashing it, and no difference. I tried the only other PCI socket in my motherboard and it would not even boot then, guess that socket isn't even working with everything else installed in my system.      I have no idea what to do now. The card refuses to work, claiming it's suffering some kind of firmware fault on POST, none of the software seems to even detect the presence of the card at all despite it physically showing up in Device Manager (although with an "An I/O adapter hardware error has occurred." error) and HWiNFO, and I am not aware of any way I can attempt a force-reflash of the firmware in case it's a software issue (although I somehow doubt it) or of what else to try.      And yes, I have a backup of my data.</Content></post><post><Title>IT BEGINS!</Title><Author>u/pele4096</Author><Content>No content</Content></post><post><Title>Just started VHS digitizing.

As for now I do not require more than 3TB raw storage and run the nas in raid 1 with only two drives.      When I eventually want to increase my storage, I am sceptical to convert my volume to raid 5. Seeing the struggles involved with recovering data from an raid 5 array, I can't trust it as an option. I am more comfortable running two 2x3TB raid 1 array, since then I know that the data is formatted such that I can fetch it without rebuilding.  Even asustor themselves does not have a method of recovering the data from an raid 5 array. I have been using snapraid before, and that is has been feeling more safe, as  when a drive has failed, only the data on that drive has potentially been lost.

I made the mistake of choosing a case that only has as many drives that I had, so wanted to do it right this time. Use case is TrueNas with some apps, running on Ryzen 5700G to optimize for idle power consumption.      I don't yet have a rack, but will be getting one when I move. Hence, I shortlisted some 4U rackmounts to place vertically first on a shelf:  Logic case sc-4316: US$350, 16 drives  Sliger CX4712 : US$399, 12 drives. I'm leaning towards this      These 4u cases aren't available for me locally - so estimated shipping to get either of those is an extra US$200, though I'm trying to find out if I can reduce that somehow.      On the other hand,, a tower like the Fractal Meshify 2 (US$150) is much cheaper, and available to me locally, so I don't have to pay much for shipping. I could get 3 of these with the money needed to get the 4U.      In this situation, are there enough advantages of those 4U cases to justify the extra expense? If I get a rack, I think I could place the Meshify 2 on its side on a shelf so that it only takes 6U.      I'm new to rackmounted chassis, so these are the pros and cons I'm weighing, let me know if I missed anything.      Pros:      Support for redundant PSUs, hot swappable fans and drives for less uptime in case of a failure      Support for larger motherboards: I currently have an ATX, not sure how useful support for larger form factors would be if I upgrade to lower end server boards      Designed for rack mounting, smaller footprint      Cons:      Expensive      Requires fan swaps for silence      Higher drive temperatures? I assume drive temps would be worse compared to e.g, the meshify      Won't fit my 160 mm cooler      Thanks for reading!</Content></post><post><Title>My new Factory Recertified 22TB Seagate hard drives</Title><Author>u/dropswisdom</Author><Content>Sorry, had to re-post due to my previous post lacking in details.      So here: got the drives here: https://www.ebay.com.sg/itm/204806952151    It was slightly cheaper when I got it. But it's one of the cheapest options you can find anywhere even now. The next step is 24TB drives which are not sold factory recertified as of yet, so they would cost.. about 50% more than this. I was concerned that some of the disks will arrive damaged, but as you can see it comes very well packaged, and they all passed testing. I put them into a Xpenology home made NAS. which is basically a itx motherboard inside a NAS case (jonsbo N1). It works like a charm. with one disk redundancy, I got about 80TB of fast storage.      They cleared the hours on it when they recertified, but not the rest I think. But all the disks passed testing and are not making any suspicious noises or giving any issues.

I erased one of four RAID volumes set up with Disk Utilities</Title><Author>u/peterinjapan</Author><Content>Hi, I'm having an issue with a RAID with a volume I accidentally erased. My Yottamaster RAID started becoming unstable and was beeping all the time, so after giving up on it, I bought a Logitech enclosure and put the drives in, creating a RAID 5 volume with SoftRaid 8.      After I got everything set up, of my disks disappeared from the new RAID, and as I was verifying the other three, another one gave me issues. So I decided to format the "new" disks and try again. I seem to have had one of the volumes in my old (backup) RAID selected, and erased it.      The backup RAID was, I think, set up as two striped RAID volumes, which were then striped together to create a raid of that. This might not be the best way to do a RAID, but there was no option other than striped or mirrored disks, and at the time SoftRaid was not working with Apple Silicon at all.      I have bought a large external disk to serve as a working disk to hopefully save my data. Can anyone suggest what will happen when I use the Restore option in Disk Utilities? If I can save the files and hopefully the folder structure, that will be good.  If there are any other tools besides Disk Utility I should be exploring, please let me know.      Sending the disks to a data service isn't an option as I'm in rural Japan.</Content></post><post><Title>Saw this and thought it belonged here.</Title><Author>u/Mist17</Author><Content>No content</Content></post><post><Title>Document Scanning Services</Title><Author>u/JL4575</Author><Content>I’m looking to scan a small collection of magazines, more than I want to manage manually.

My point being that in the past 2 years more damage has been done to the current scene of the internet and preservation than all the years prior, it's not just about piracy or emulation, it's more than that, google search was a vital core of the internet and it's been ripped out.      It's like the adage that there is a man in Czechoslovakia maintaining a piece of software that is crucial to the internet's existence and multiple times that has proven to be true, and now google has fallen and the internet is worse for it.      A big loss that most people don't know if is that visa through their various connections to right wing christian organisations was actively campaigned by mormon extremists to revoke funding from most of the main xxx websites such as pornhub and xhamster, this seems funny, but an incredible amount of material was lost and i don't think it wise to dismiss something like this as just some minor occurrence.      This may have been one of the largest data losses ever, the loss of amateur content on pornhub represented billions of hours of video that is lost to time, and PornHub conclusively proved that it was a sham case set up by a mormon church that aims to ban all adult material and even then, they were forced to shut down a retaliatory case and to shut down the amateur section of the site because of pressure from visa.      The government itself has made material that many corporations would prefer you don't have access to such as fixing old factory equipment and booklets on home electric repair, with the american governments currently starting the fight to launch right to repair, you must realise that the companies would prefer if you did not have that right or information, ifixit and it's guides would be eliminated.      Even the people testing products, tech channels like linus and level 1 techs would all be eliminated in time, too much finds itself at odds with these companies and you think it's hypothetical but if you upload a video tearing down an iphone and repairing it, apple may take it down, they are known to do it, same for john deer tractor hacks and lg washing machine repair videos, this is a fight, and we are losing.      Anyways, i just see things getting worse and frankly it seems like we aren't bouncing back how the internet seems to think we are, the torrent scenes are no where near as alive as they used to be, even with private trackers, the scene is a shadow of what it once was, and i only see it getting worse, so hoard, data hoard it all.</Content></post><post><Title>Upgrading from a USB JBOD</Title><Author>u/doubledundercoder</Author><Content>Hey all.

Upgrading to a SAS enclosure or just getting a desktop case where I plug in the drives directly to the sata controller, what kind of performance increase can I expect for multiple processes on the volume? Am I dreaming thinking it will make a huge difference? It’s mostly for hosting Plex. Anyone gone from this setup to a direct attached on zfs?      4 7.2k sata drives</Content></post><post><Title>Best way to transcode entire library of videos on Google Drive preferably though Google cloud</Title><Author>u/cewong2</Author><Content>I’ve been searing around for a day and a half trying to find a way to transcode lots of videos I have stored in my Google drive. I haven’t been able to find anyone ever having a solution (lots of what I’ve found isn’t gets downloaded and reuploaded after transcoding). Hopefully this is posted in the right place otherwise please suggest a subReddit for me to post to.      Lots of my videos are in x264 format and I want to transcode them into x265 as I read there’s possibly a saving of at least 20-30% but it’s nearly 60-70TB which would take probably a long time compared just using Google’s free cloud trial.

No majors issues, although I haven't had to test a full restore. I've been tempted to switch to Macrium as I already have a disk image using Macrium and switching would then mean I'm only using one piece of software instead of two.      But, with regards to file and folder backup, what would I miss by switching to Macrium? I'm a home user and not knowledgeable on the more technical side of backup software. I believe Arq does a full backup and incremental from then on. I know Macrium has this option also.      My main need is software that will never delete a file from a backup, no matter if I delete the source file or move it. Retaining a few versions. Bonus would be the ability to mirror this backup to the cloud in some form.      Currently, I have local backup to an external drive using Arq, and cloud backup to backblaze using their personal computer license. So it's two different pieces of software but that's not a problem.</Content></post><post><Title>Power Outage Froze my TrueNAS OS. How to Monitor Offsite TrueNAS Replication?</Title><Author>u/Luz3r</Author><Content>Hey everyone,      I recently had a power outage at my backup location, and it seems to have messed with my TrueNAS box. It got stuck in a weird state, but thankfully a reboot fixed it. The problem is, I don't check my offsite server that often since it's a secondary location. This time, I only found out because I got an alert about my ZFS replication failing.  My question is: How can I best check if my replication is actually working properly?      I was thinking about setting up Uptime Kuma to monitor the offsite TrueNAS web interface. While this wouldn't necessarily tell me if replication is failing, it might catch issues like SSH being unresponsive. Ideally, I'd like to get Telegram alerts for any problems.  Anyone have any suggestions for a better or cool way to monitor my TrueNAS replication health?</Content></post><post><Title>Can 3.5” external enclosure setup drive</Title><Author>u/ChillCaptain</Author><Content>https://www.amazon.com/SSK-External-Docking-Enclosure-Supports/dp/B08P1539VD/ref=asc_df_B08P1539VD/?hvadid=693495256271&amp;amp;hvpos=&amp;amp;hvnetw=g&amp;amp;hvrand=2570617204095985210&amp;amp;hvpone=&amp;amp;hvptwo=&amp;amp;hvqmt=&amp;amp;hvdev=m&amp;amp;hvdvcmdl=&amp;amp;hvlocint=&amp;amp;hvlocphy=9057119&amp;amp;hvtargid=pla-1626594922711&amp;amp;psc=1&amp;amp;mcid=086ce8faf4d5351490f73a899c982a27&amp;amp;gad_source=1    I’m looking to get this enclosure to help with backups.

I have two needs:      Backups - I presently have 2 x 3TB 5.4k rpm HDDs for storage in a desktop nearby. This PC needs to be replaced as its old and dying slowly. The HDDs work great - used for cold storage. the PC is off most of the time.      More working space. Presently, I just keep my MBP clear of working document - i only load one project at a time and work off the internal 500GB SSD. This works but is getting tedious. I typically edit in either iMovie or Davinci Resolve (depending on project needs) and would like to move this to a larger DAS.      I'm thinking I'd like      1 DAS with 4 bays. But from who? OWC? MediaSonic?      Configure the two HDDs into a single Raid 1 for local backups with redundancy. I'll copy files to cold storage as needed. This data is backed up to an external drive in a fire-safe and critical docs are backedup to the cloud as well.      Configure two SSDs into a single Raid 1 for faster working space redundancy. I'll use these as working space for editing two or three streams of 1080.60 video. Once projects are finished, the final result and maybe the raw footage is saved to the HDDs for archival.      Questions:      General thoughts for this approach? I'm sure i'm not the only one doing this but I couldn't find anything. Maybe I should just go RAID 10 or 5 or something :(      Is there a specific bus type to handle 2x 1 Raid? How do i know if a DAS can handle this 2x Raid 1 configuration? is any JBOD good enough? Suggestions for affordable DAS?      Raid controllers? Do i use Disk Utility or the DAS's softwareraid? Who's got the best notification of a failed drive?      Speed - ideally i'd like NVMe as it's fast and future proof (i.e. I'll eventually get into 4k filming, maybe). Are there boxes that have NVMe and HDD? I couldn't find any. Would SSDs suffice (the 2.5" variety such as evos).      edited for clarity</Content></post><post><Title>Is this Rot?</Title><Author>u/MDCasino21</Author><Content>No content</Content></post><post><Title>Synology vs Ebay PC</Title><Author>u/Suspicious_Dig_5684</Author><Content>So I have a server; what I am looking for is something to put 2 18tb drives in and be a dedicated photo backup for both IPhone and Android.

I have the left side of the shelf totally full, and the right side partially full, but mostly empty. The drives on the right side were sitting around 45c, but the drives on the left side hit 67c (!!!!). I thought the drive sensors might be lying, since they were so high. I took a closer look at the empty slots and realized that the airflow that the PSUs were moving were likely coming mostly from the back of the unit since that's a path of less resistance than flowing over the drives themselves.      I printed 2 of these guys: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:6514452. I stuck them in the slots, and within 10 seconds the fans spun way up and started moving serious air. Now the drives are all around 35-42c, totally normal!      So if you have a NetApp disk shelf, check your drive temps and make sure you block every open port. There's also an STL available to blank off IOM slots if you need it under the netapp category. Of course, they're available to buy as well.</Content></post><post><Title>Currently have a desktop PC with a 1-bay NAS hosting my video and audio.

To give you some background, my wife is a professional photographer primarily working in digital. For many years, she has been using an external drive for her work. I, on the other hand, shoot film but recently started digitizing my photos.      We had a Synology SD215 for a few years, which met many of our needs but was ultimately too slow for my wife's requirements. Additionally, we didn't fully utilize its capabilities. Now though, we believe integrating a NAS back into our workflow is exactly what we’re looking for.      Some requirements:      A storage solution that allows multiple users to interact with it simultaneously.      Large storage capacity with fast read and write speeds.      RAID capability for data loss protection.      Versatility for various uses, including working storage, archival storage for digital assets (primarily images), potential Plex use, and security camera support.      A "set it and forget it" solution that won't require frequent upgrades or replacements.      Until this morning I was considering the OWC Jupiter Minibut I have some concerns about its network requirements (though I’m not opposed to upgrading our network if necessary). I’ve also considered a DIY approach but would prefer a solution with customer support in casewe encounterany issues.      Any recommendations you have would be greatly appreciated.

I'm currently using Apple's Photos to store nearly all my photos, in conjunction with periodically exporting my images from iCloud to hard drives.      I have a good degree of organization of my exported files, able to export them with dates attached. This is useful for finding photos from trips I know the dates of or walking down memory lane. I also backed up the actual Photo Libraries that the app loads back when they were manageable sizes that could be stored on my computer.      When I did work for distance learning, downloaded images, etc, the amount of images I generated skyrocketed. Since then iCloud's image recognition and character recognition abilities have become exceptional in my opinion, even processing frames of videos. However, this is not available on the desktop app.      My efficiency has increased, as on my phone I can search my indexed library going back years by date, location, subject, and text. As of late I have been delighted to see that I can also search by text for images in folders on my Mac. I want to reap these benefits on an external storage drive.      I've seen multiple image library applications with OCR capabilities. I understand that they are not able to handle such a large volume of images. I do like the convenience of scrolling through a library and am interested in hearing suggestions for these, although I have done some research myself. An issue that it poses is (in my experience) libraries doubling the amount of space my images take up by making their own copies for the library, and if I attempted to put all my photos into libraries that would take up so much space.      I wonder if an idea I have has been executed by anyone other than Apple: is there any program that will alter the metadata, or create an index independent of a library app, such that I could search by text within Finder(/file explorer)? I want to use this feature on my backup drives and have all my images processed like what my laptop is currently doing locally. Or alternatively, is there a way to use Apple's feature on an external drive?</Content></post><post><Title>Searching for a decent 5+ bay JBOD with UASP</Title><Author>u/ShapeShifter499</Author><Content>Is there a decent 5 or more bay JBOD enclosure that supports UASP?

I have tried Googling this with terms like "cold storage" and "file retrieval" but those are giving me results that aren't applicable to my use-case scenario. I'm sure this setup exists, I just have no idea what it's called or what words to search for it.  My current setup:    I have two drives:      an "active" 2TB NVMe SSD, where I put all the stuff I'm actively working on      an "offline" 24TB SATA HDD, where I put all the stuff I'm not actively working on      The folder structure is identical between the drives, but to optimize space, no actual data is duplicated between them.      (Yes, I have both drives backed up to a third drive.)  The problem:    It's getting cumbersome having to manually move files to and from these drives as I need them, especially while preserving the file structure. I always have to dig into every folder to move the individual files because I don't need EVERYTHING in that folder. And it's hard to keep them in sync or avoid file conflicts because every syncing program I've found tries to sync EVERYTHING.  What I want:    Is there a way to automate this process, so that I only ever look at my SSD, but my SSD shows me everything that's on the HDD too as if they're one drive, and when I open a file on the SSD, it transfers it over from my HDD?

Here's my conundrum:      I initially scraped this drive for all .jpg files and it pulled about 11,000 files (this was a year ago). I'm now running the same program again, and searching for .jpg and it's only pulling about 3,000 files. I initially thought that maybe the data search was interrupted so I ran it again, and it pulled about the same amount. What's going on here? Is this software just not as robust as I thought?

I've been looking for a replacement setup (mostly a NAS) that would sip power and leaning toward a one box solution to save on CPU power overhead.      Some of the requirements I've come up with:      Must have a NAS Component for backups/storage      Must have enough compute power for simple services (Jellyfin, VPN, Hass)      Should be able to do some basic transcoding (Jellyfin) preferably AV1      Nice to have would be a NPU for basic AI task (Frigate/Hass)      Inspired by the Asustor Flashstor ( gen 1 &amp;amp; gen 2), Minisforum MS-01 and some perusing of the intel spec sheets I found this "gem": Intel Core Ultra 5 125H.      What's interesting with this processor are the 28 PCIe lanes which would theoretically allow for 12 M.2 SSD with   2 PCIe lanes each and still have 4 PCIe lanes free (can add NIC or other). It also has hardware support for AV1 transcoding and an NPU. Finally, since it's a 5 series processor it should have plenty of power for my needs.   System configuration    The configuration I came up with is interesting because it has 4 drives with a higher throughput (Gen5 x2) if we use SSDs like the Samsung 990 EVO which support PCIe® 4.0 x4 or 5.0 x2 interface.      N.B.: An alternative config. would be a 6 drives config with all drives connected to a x4 interface      Finally, this is just a theoretical configuration, a bunch of stuff could go wrong like improper support for the PCIe bifurcation for the x1 interface of the CPU. But I'm also bullish on this and would love to see an equivalent spec'd CPU from the newly announced Lunar Lake architecture generation (better energy efficiency, more powerful CPU, GPU and NPU with better power management) .  Some discussion points for the community:    What are your thoughts?      What would you change to better fit your needs?      Any improvement suggestions?      Which manufacturer would you like to see try to bring this to market?

Then I googled, and the following points were made:      btrfs: Super bad because silently is overfilled and getting NOENT - all disk used, but regular rebalance is completely not recommended to avoid this issue altogether. Apparently misrepresents actual disk space.ZFS: Super bad because will never be in Linux tree, and is hard to maintain, apparently "just hype"https://www.reddit.com/r/zfs/comments/sfo1tq/linus_tech_tips_fails_at_using_zfs_properly_loses/https://storytime.ivysaur.me/posts/why-not-zfs/https://github.com/openzfs/zfs/labels/Type%3A%20Defect    And then we had that corruption bug in ZFS.

But its really hard to get any reliable info on the matter, which is why Im making this post.      Is magnetic tape actually cheaper? Some older reddit posts say that this is not the case (and indeed, the latest LTO tape is much more expensive per TB than a hard drive), but at the same time, random websites on the internet seem to pitch some wild prices, such as this one (or the same one from another site) (or the same one from amazon, wait wtf why are all the cheap ones the same model), which comes at about 6 bucks per terabyte of data. This is way better than even a used hard drive.      Are there any hidden costs or technical issues that one could expect? Or does it just behave like a hard drive but with much lower speeds? Do they wear out or are they expected to last more than hard drives? Is there any issue with buying used?      Is it even possible to encrypt this data (in particular with Veracrypt)? This is kind of a dealbreaker for me otherwise, as I greatly value data security.      I generally store lots of random data across many folders, in the form of a digital library. Generally books/films by category. Plus random family pictures and work documents here and there.Speed is not much of a concern, nor is having the storage cold. My hard drives usually take all night to sync, then they stay disconnected until needed again.</Content></post><post><Title>Are there any legit m-disks currently for sale?</Title><Author>u/Gwyn777</Author><Content>Of course I see the ones on amazon, but they look sketchy.

B2 has been great so far but ultimately I'd rather be paying $0.6/TB/month than $6/TB/month for my offsite backups.      I'm also considering the "at a friend's house" solution.

I understand that the condition of the hardware is very important but I want to see what we can do on software level to at least have some better chances at recovery when something happens.      Using RAR archives with recovery records? Does compression settings matter? Store, Fastest, Best, etc.      Whole disk encryption on the backup drive? (Or a partition to also have easy access to other files)      Is there any reason to use a backup program for this purpose? They also put all files into one single file, with or without compression, is it any different than a rar/7zip/zip file?

As a rule of thumb, I keep footage for 5 years, in case people need some additonal stuff, photos or videos later (happened only like 3 times ever, but still).For quite some time i've been using OM-D E-M5 Mark III, which as far as I know can only record with h.264. (at least thats what we've always recorded in), and only switched to h.265/hevc camera quite recently. Problem is, I've got terabytes of old h.264 files left over, and space is becoming an issue., there's only so many drives I can store safely and/or connect to computer.What I'd like is to convert h.264 files to h.265, which would save me terabytes of space, but all the solutions I've found by researching so far include very small amount of files being converted, and even then it takes quite some time.What I've got is ~3520 video files in h.264, around 9 terabytes total space.What would be the best way to convert all of that into h.265?</Content></post><post><Title>Next Step from WD Black 4TB?</Title><Author>u/Hawthm_the_Coward</Author><Content>Hello! I've been using a home setup with a 1 TB SSD and an older model WD Black 4 TB HDD for some time now. It's done a good job, but lately, I've been annoyed with the HDD's capabilities... It's fairly noisy despite being in a quieting enclosure, and the 4 TB capacity is pretty close to being filled up.      So, here are some considerations I have.      The replacement absolutely must be 7200 RPM, and a similar performance. Applications regularly load from this drive so a 5400 RPM drive is not an option. No matter what, this has to hold true.      A quieter drive without losing capacity would be very nice. I'd be alright swapping for something like a 4 TB Blue if it was comparable.      Alternatively, a size upgrade would also be great. I've heard the Exos X18 16 TB is good and also pretty fast. How much worse would the noise be compared to the Black?      If possible, a slight upgrade to both would be wonderful. Would an HGST He8 6TB be quieter, too?

Any alternatives to Retrospect?</Title><Author>u/blunderbot</Author><Content>Just wondering if there's another way to archive my largish projects on a Mac. I'm about to upgrade the computer that handles this work (probably to a Mac Mini M2) so now is a good time to weigh my options.      Jobs range from 5-20TB, each job is in its own folder that is then archived to a collective Media Set. At the moment, the archives are kept on hard drives that I keep offline.      The best feature for me is that I can search the Media Set for the offline files I want to restore and easily grab just those files. I need to do this for less than 5% of my jobs so it's great when it works, but not worth spending $ on solutions with ongoing costs.      But retrospect occasionally needs to rebuild the catalog which significantly slows down the process.

However, there are still two things I can't figure out (or find recent opinions about at least).      My first issue is choosing an internal burner to buy. Currently I only have an array of old DVD drives to batch rip old DVDs and no experience regarding bluray/M-DISK. I feel like I can only find product recommendations that are quite a few years old and it feels like one year people tend to recommend pioneer over everything else and another year its only LG and the year after pioneer again and so on...      On top I can't figure out what to even watch out for. For example the currently available Pioneer drives BDR-S12XLT, BDR-213EBK, BDR-S13EBK, etc. all offer the same compatibility, same write speeds, same read speeds, and according as to how I read their product page the exact same features. Is there even something in a technical data sheet I can use to judge whether one drive might be more reliable for my use case than the other? What drives do you use/recommend in 2024 and why?      My base line requirement is just burning M-DISKs (single/dual layer) and occasionally ripping a Blu-ray. Linux support would be highly appreciated but I can fall back to a windows system I have to keep running for other legacy scanning software anyways.      For backing up old collections of media which won't change I guess how to do it is pretty straight forward. However, I'd also like to backup folders that like to change and grow like my document folders. These changing folders by far do not even come close to fill up the capacity of any M-DISK as of now. So I'd like to regularly keep burning info about recent changes/new files only on the same disk to not waste e.g. a 25 GB disk every time I backup a 3 GB folder. I originally intended to write a few small scripts that would keep track of changes/new files since last backup and manage versioning for writing/restoring those. However, I feel like reinventing the wheel here but can't really find the software I am looking for. Any simple and open source software recommendations there?

Plus it’s cheaper than shipping full sized VHS tapes.      Unsurprisingly I’ll find home videos in the lots I buy. A part of me feels obligated to make digital copies since they’re someone’s memories, and also a time capsule of that period of time. Another part of me feels I shouldn’t because they are someone’s personal recording that I assume they had no plans to show outside of their homes. And then again, what do I even do with the digital copies if I do make them besides hoard them? I legally couldn’t share them most likely. I wouldn’t mind digitizing a copy and sending it to the original owner, but since it’s just a random lot online from a resale shop, there’s nothing really to go off of.      I’ve found NSFW content as well, but the choice with that stuff is obvious and I just erase them. The normal, everyday stuff though I’m unsure about.

From the rules and the wiki it does seem ok, but I'm new to this sub.      So currently I have two external SSDs for my home server. I'm using SSD_A to save all my stuff to it and SSD_B as a backup.      Now in the near future my SSD_A will be full. So I want to do the following: I want to buy a very large HDD use that as a backup and then use the two SSDs as my standard mounts for the home server to save stuff to.  Ideas    I could use mergerfs to combine both external SSDs to one mount point. I need to to this for some of my applications.      I could then use rsync to create my backups from the SSD-mergerfs-mount to the HDD.      Hopefully there is an rsync flag to indicate that I do not want to sync already existing data again (even if it changed). This ensures that broken files will not overwrite healthy files on the HDD. Yes, I know that this means that changes to files won't be backed up but this is ok for my use case.      I could use ext4 for all drives, cause there is no reason not to and I do not know anything else.      What do the experts think? Does that sound like a good approach? Could anything go wrong? I do not care about write speed to the SSDs they are fast enough I do not need striping. I also do not care if some data gets lost between the back up cycles so I do not need RAID.      Is mergerfs the best there is and is it easy to set up?      Should I use anything else then ext4? ext4 has always been my go to and I do not really see anything wrong with it. File hashes seem to be unnecessary cause I can just not overwrite existing files, that seems to do the trick for my use case.      Very much appreciate any feedback on my plan.</Content></post><post><Title>Do you guys think there's interest in things like this being scanned and preserved? 70s Pamphlets (gardening, cooking, random health stuff like self breast exams and mongolism)</Title><Author>u/Quirky_Ad_69</Author><Content>No content</Content></post><post><Title>Is anyone happy with iDrive?</Title><Author>u/Jack15911</Author><Content>This is an honest question because most people who are happy with their service don't write about it.

I currently have it on an 8TB internal HDD and once every 3 months do a copy to my external HDD and delete the old backup.      Moving forward I am looking to have the external HDD connected to the PC 24/7 and monitor for changes in the source folders on the internal HDD and mirror those changes to the external HDD.  So if I delete something on the internal, it deletes from the external.  Add to the internal, it adds to the external.      After some research of looks like SyncBack 11 will do this and is free.  I see Veeam mentioned quite a bit.  What is the best option out there for free or low cost?

"Synchronize Files and Folders" =&amp;gt; https://freefilesync.org    It's really just a copy program - pretty typical and standard. Except it does SUCH a good job.      You can set up sessions that copies when you run them - so update, mirror, things like that, to arbitrarily complex sets of disks and files. I use it extensively for backups to always know my files are backed up. It needs to be kicked off manually, but it just works so well and I like monitoring the steps.      Most especially, I move files around between diff folders (think picture sorting, etc) and it will figure that out and "move" the files versus "always re-copy". So it really speeds everything up.      So really what I use it for is "make sure every file is backed up properly" - and it does it really well - it "never gives up until success" no matter what happens. You can just re-run and make sure it's "all up to date".      It supports Windows, Mac, and I think linux - so same on all platforms. It's donation-ware - and I think there is some more features if you donate - but I don't remember since I donated since the very beginning.      No other tool really does it as well - no Windows copy or anything like that gives me any confidence like this does.</Content></post><post><Title>WD Passport Ultra on Mac: HFS+ vs NTFS with WD Driver</Title><Author>u/DatasTemporalLobe</Author><Content>Trying to get a WD Passport Ultra to work on a Mac in order to back up an iPhone.

I like that I'd be able to use the hard drive on a pc if I go with NTFS with the Paragon driver but am I losing any functionality on the Mac?</Content></post><post><Title>Most efficient method of syncing a primary drive to a back-up drive (MacOS)</Title><Author>u/pipmike</Author><Content>I could use advise on which syncing software to use for a Mac and two external hard drives.      Scenario:      I have one external hard drive as my primary "hoard" drive to which I actively add large files (1+ GB), move files to different folders, change file tags, etc.      I have a second external hard drive that I use as my first-level disaster recovery in case my primary drive fails. The second drive is currently one-way synced to the primary hard drive using a rysnc script i wrote.      I don't need to store changes or previous file versions. Just want to mirror one drive to another.      While rsync gets the job done, it doesn't handle the above efficiently because any changes are seen as new files, which means it's constantly writing/re-writing large files to the secondary hard drive.      If I change the name of a directory including 100+ GB of files, rather than just similarly rename the directory of the secondary hard drive, rsync will delete all of the files, create a new directory, and re-sync all of those files.      If I rename a file, rysnc will delete the file and then rewrite it.      If I add a MacOS file tag to the file, rysnc will delete the file and then rewrite it.      Thus, if I make any directory changes or tags, rsync can take hours (even days) to re-sync. I can imagine that's not healthy on either drive.      It would be great if MacOS had a native function that said "if I do anything to Drive A, do the same thing to Drive B", but I haven't found it if it exists. Thus, I'm looking at other options (Chronosync, Carbon Copy Cloner, etc.) that might be a better solution for my use case.      Open for all suggestions or feedback.</Content></post><post><Title>How to avoid wasting time encrypting twice? Need to encrypt eHDD and want to encrypt cloud storage.

Is it possible to encrypt first using veracrypt then simply rclone upload those contents to the cloud?

And, I will tag the original post's author u/KeptinGL6:      Just to clarify for everyone, MPF is the overall GUI.      There are 3 main utilities from different people that are used in the Media Preservation Frontend program:      Redumper      AARU      Disc Image Creator (DIC)  DIC is actively being phased out. Redumper is pretty much the gold standard right now. AARU is also very well developed. DIC's original developer sort-of abandoned it and it's regarded as a legacy dumper utility and will be phased out at some point.    Edit: Some clarification. The original developer behind DIC didn't abandon it. Redumper is being chosen over DIC where applicable and/or possible.      These programs' inception originate to the Redump.org, Video Game Preservation Collective, Gaming Alexandria and Hit Save! organizations and communities where, through Discord, a ton of collaboration has taken hold for proactive media preservation, the world over. It's a very sizable, but niche community of dedicated people very much akin to the VHS Decode and Domesday Laser Disc duplicator projects.

They can be used to preserve all forms of media. EAC, Exact Audio Copy, is a bit dated because it can not grab, for example, compact disc subcodehttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_Disc_subcode    Redumper can be found here:https://github.com/superg/redumperBOS (Binary Object Scanner) is an integral part of MPF for detection of copy protection mechanisms and can be found here: https://github.com/SabreTools/BinaryObjectScanner    While EAC is a decent utility, it lacks the ability to grab all possible information written to a an optical disc.

Each server will have two virtual disks connected: one for live data, and one for backup (on separate physical hard drives). The plan is to use Rsnapshot to backup the live data onto the backup data disk.      In the past, I've had troubles where files has somehow gotten corrupted, and then the backup of the working files has rolled out of scope in the backup scheme, losing me those files. I'm told that there are file systems that can help me avoid that sort of thing. But which one? For the backups, I'm thinking simply ext4 since it's just rock solid. But for the live data, something like btrfs or zfs sounds good, but I cannot make my mind up about which one, or even if either is what I want. Ideally, I could run some tool once in a while, and if the tool spots corruption, I could just restore the file from backup. Which is best for this out of btrfs or zfs?

I got all hyped, it enclosures the treasures from my golden years. Sadly, it doesn't seem to work properly anymore —even when it was stored in a dry fresh dark place (for over a decade).      When I plugged it in the computer it was able to read it without issue. Knowing the fragility of the situation, I started to copy the whole drive instead of browsing it. After 10% or so it stopped working. I re-plugged it in a different port and retried with similar results (with a progress equally low). After that it became hard to read it so I stopped —I didn't want to damage it by forcing a huge transfer in an unstable condition.      My current plan is to try to access it from some Linux distro and, if I can read it, copy by folders (everything is organized in main categories).

For a bit of background, my laptop is currently filled with all my stuff (personal documents, stuff from my undergrad, photos, videos, phone back ups, etc.). I currently just have a back up on a WD 1 TB HDD (I know I'm a bad boy for not following the 3-2-1 method, but I am trying to now!). I've been using this HDD for the past 8 years (and it saved my ass when my laptop died on me twice), and I am recently starting to hear sounds from it when it's running and it got me worried to find a replacement.      All my data is ~250 GB, and I am looking for recommendations on what are some good external hard drives I can use! Although I am considering online cloud services, but I'm not sure if I want to pay a yearly subscription which has roughly the same annual cost similar to an external hard drive. I would prefer to pay for 2 hard drives and have it last for couple of years instead, rinse and repeat.      I am looking to buy 2 hard drives, but am having a hard time decide which ones. I don't care about transfer speeds, and am looking for 500GB to 1 TB memory. The thing I care most about is that it lasts. I know there isn't any guarantee a that a external drive will last and could die any moment, but I would prefer it to last at least 5 years (hopefully 10 years) before I find a replacement. I generally do a back up 3-4 times a year, and let it collect dust on my shelf for the rest of the year.      I was thinking of buying a HDD since I thought those last longer than SSDs, but apparently a bunch of websites on Google is telling me otherwise? That today's SSDs now last as long as HDDs or longer? Has SSDs surpassed HDDs in the past decade?      Right now, I got my eyes on:      Samsung T7 1 TB Portable SSD      LaCie Rugged Mini 1 TB (SSD)      Seagate STHN1000400 1TB Backup Plus Slim Portable Drive      WD - Easystore 1TB External USB 3.0 Portable Drive      I'm thinking I may do 1 HDD and 1 SSD cause why not lmao.

While I have since decided to build myself a proper NAS to serve as my primary storage (with external storage and a cloud service serving as the backups), a couple questions still remain in regards to my current practices with external storage:      To my understanding, there are far better hashing algorithms than CRC32 but would they provide any tangible benefits over CRC32 solely from a data corruption perspective (e.g. a lower chance of hash remaining the same in the event of corruption, even if unlikely to begin with)?      (I'm probably overthinking this one, but) does it matter if I have one checksum file per directory (that contains all the file hashes in said directory) as opposed to an individual file per item?      Lastly, would there be a more efficient method of checking the directories (opening checksum files to verify file integrity) than doing so manually? I don't have much practical knowledge with running scripts and the like, but am willing to learn if necessary.

Sometimes the import function didn't work as expected and I had to import everything all over again. Long story short, I now have 3 folders:      Folder 1: Old pictures that are in DICM folders. It branches out quite a bit and their names are IMG_0001.Folder 2: A folder with pictures and videos split into two folders.Folder 3: Main folder that I want everything to be in. Most of it is right, but I'm sure it is missing the older pictures and videos in Folder 1.      What I'm looking for:      I want the pictures and videos to be chronologically placed so I can go through them without interruption.      Preferably a program that would look at the 3 folders and create a new folder with all the files organized like 2024-05-28_IMG_0001.      Remove duplicates so they don't occupy space unnecessarily. It could check if the file was created at the same time, instead of comparing the files one by one.      What I've done so far:      Tried using AntiDupl.NET but it would take too long to sort them one by one.      Tried using dupeGuru but I can't verify the files actually being duplicates.      A slight problem could be that some images are in .HEIC and some videos are in .HEVC format. I don't mind them being in that format as I use ImageGlass to view the pictures and VLC to view the videos.      Extra: I'd appreciate if anybody have a good method of backing up their pictures and videos on their iPhone.</Content></post><post><Title>6 bay USB Raid enclosure</Title><Author>u/boglim_destroyer</Author><Content>I just set up my DS224+ with mirrored 16tb drives and am currently backing up to a 5tb external, as my data can fit on that currently.

I typically just add drives to my desktop, so in that sense I'm already super used to treating each drive individually.      Been considering an NAS because sometimes the random drive spin-up causing the whole system to slow down or pause. Can be annoying, esp when gaming, that's why I'm considering shifting all my data storage off-pc.      I thought it was just a matter of getting a NAS and plugging the drives in, but it seems like in a NAS, it is considered a single storage drive regardless of the number of drives it has?      I'm assuming you can split up the storage, but that's still not using the drives individually yes?      Or is there a way/setting you can set so that you don't have to use any kind of RAID and just have the system treat each drive as, well, a drive?</Content></post><post><Title>Is there an easyish app to auto-save and organize images and videos that meet a certain criteria?</Title><Author>u/drupadoo</Author><Content>Like everytime I watch a youtube video, just download it and back it up.

I first had a ScanSnap ix1600 and now I have the Epson ES-580W. Both are great scanners, although I like the ES-580W a bit better because it has a web interface. But now I have reached the point where I don't want to bring every existing scanner into my house just to see if it has the functions I want, simply because the internet doesn't provide enough information. Therefore, I am reaching out to you for help.      I need a scanner that allows me to create a large number of different profiles, in which I can then scan to a network folder. The reason is that my family and I have a wide variety of different documents that all need to be scanned directly into the corresponding folders (around 60+ profiles/shortcuts). The ScanSnap only has a handful of profiles and even though the Epson has 300 contacts, I can ultimately only create 48 presets. And I would like to be able to customize the file prefixes for each profile.      I am hoping the community can help me find a suitable scanner. It should have what the previous two had, but additionally, it is important to me that it:      Has a web server where I can make my settings (create profiles, etc.)      Has a lot of Network Folder Shortcuts. Or alot of Shortcuts in General.      Can scan receipts well      Can handle no less than 30 pages      The Epson was pleasantly quiet, so it would be great if it wasn't too loud (not a main criterion)      The cheaper, the better, but given the price range I am currently considering, I expect to find something around €800 or less with the desired features.      I look forward to your responses and hope that people can help me out.</Content></post><post><Title>Help with portable music storage</Title><Author>u/tejasdharmabum</Author><Content>Hello!

I first had a ScanSnap ix1600 and now I have the Epson ES-580W. Both are great scanners, although I like the ES-580W a bit better because it has a web interface. But now I have reached the point where I don't want to bring every existing scanner into my house just to see if it has the functions I want, simply because the internet doesn't provide enough information. Therefore, I am reaching out to you for help.      I need a scanner that allows me to create a large number of different profiles, in which I can then scan to a network folder. The reason is that my family and I have a wide variety of different documents that all need to be scanned directly into the corresponding folders (around 60+ profiles/shortcuts). The ScanSnap only has a handful of profiles and even though the Epson has 300 contacts, I can ultimately only create 48 presets. And I would like to be able to customize the file prefixes for each profile.      I am hoping the community can help me find a suitable scanner. It should have what the previous two had, but additionally, it is important to me that it:      Has a web server where I can make my settings (create profiles, etc.)      Has a lot of Network Folder Shortcuts. Or alot of Shortcuts in General.      Can scan receipts well      Can handle no less than 30 pages      The Epson was pleasantly quiet, so it would be great if it wasn't too loud (not a main criterion)      The cheaper, the better, but given the price range I am currently considering, I expect to find something around €800 or less with the desired features.      I look forward to your responses and hope that people can help me out.</Content></post><post><Title>Help with portable music storage</Title><Author>u/tejasdharmabum</Author><Content>Hello!

Both full of data (both almost filled up). When plugged into my laptop (MacBook Pro 2017, 16GB RAM, 4 USB-C ports) the access time to the data significantly varies: while for both disks the root is readily available the moment you click the disk icon and open the drive, for the SSD drive it takes a while (sometimes rather long while, I'd say) to show the contents of a folder, while for the HDD it takes no time at all. This surprises me greatly, for what I used to think (mechanic-wise) the HDD having moving parts, spindle and platters and head to position, it should take longer to locate the data, when the SSD having no need to position the head and all that it should be a split second to give me access to the data in a folder. Can this be related to how my OS (macOS Monterey 12.7.5) accesses the drives? Anyone with the same "issue" (can't name it a real issue since I do have access to the data)? Please advise.

The Node 804 was a good case, with great temps, but swapping hard drives around was a pain. The 804 is also ginormous.      So, why the Sagittarius? It met my requirements for MATX, eight externally accessible drive bays, and what appeared to be good drive cooling. I also considered:      Audheid K7. Only had two 92mm fans and some reviews reported high drive temps. Also required buying a Flex PSU.      Audheid 8-Bay 2023 Edition. Provides better cooling with two 120mm fans but still required a Flex PSU if you wanted all 8 drive bays.      Jonsbo N4. Only 4 bays were externally accessible and it only has one 120mm fan.      Overall, I'm happy with the Sagittarius case. Its very compact yet it holds 8 drives, an MATX motherboard, and four 120mm fans. My drive and CPU temps are excellent.      But, you really need to plan your build because there's no documentation, no cable management, and because some connectors are hidden by other components. If you don't plug in your cables as you build then you'll never get to them later after the build is complete. You also need think about air flow which I'll discuss after documenting my build.      Time for some photos, starting with the empty case.   Empty Case    The two small rectangular holes in the upper and bottom left are all you have for routing cables from this, the motherboard side, to the hard drives on the other side. I ran 4 SATA cables through each of these holes.      My motherboard mounts 4 of its SATA Ports along the edge so I had to plug those in before installing the motherboard itself. Otherwise, those connectors would have been practically inaccessible:   Motherboard Edge Connector Issues    The case supports two 2.5 SSD drives that are screwed to the bottom of the case. But, if you do, they will be flush to the case so plugging in cables will be near impossible. I purchased some 1/4" nylon standoffs and longer M3-10 screws to elevate the SSDs a bit. It was still a pain to plug in the cables (because they are toward the bottom of this photo) but it worked:       I routed all my SATA and fan cables next. I have 10 SATA ports total, two for SSDs and 8 for HDDs. Four of those interfaces are on an ASM-1064 PCIe add-on board and the rest are on the motherboard.      Then, it was time for the power supply. I strongly suggest using a modular SFX power supply that typically comes with shorter cables. Long, or unnecessary, cables will be an issue because there's no place to put them. Also note you should plug in the EPS power cable before you install the power supply because you'll never get to it afterward:   EPS Power Connector    Also make sure you route the SATA power cable before installing the power supply.      Last, install the fans. Standard 25mm thickness fans just barely clear the main motherboard power cable at the bottom of this picture. Also note I installed fan grills on all my fans otherwise (for my airflow) the cables would have hit the fan blades:   Finished Interior    Now, about the "drive sleds". This case only provides rubber bushings and screws to fasten those bushings to the sides of your hard drives. They also provide a metal plate with a bend that acts as the handle to pull the drive from the case:   "Drive Sled"    This is really basic but I found it works well.      Wrapping up, here's a photo of the finished product. You can see the slots on the right that hold the rubber bushings that are attached to the hard drives.   Final Result w/o Drive Bay Cover    I installed four 120mm Phanteks fans (from my old Node 804) into this case and all of them are configured to exhaust air from the case. There are two behind the grill on the left of this picture and you can see that the fan screws just go through the grating holes. Air for the left side of the case is pulled in through holes in the rear and a large grating on the left side of the case (not visible here). So, on the left, air is pulled from the side and down towards the CPU and motherboard before exhausting out the front.      On the right, there are two fans behind the hard drive cage. They too exhaust air that is pulled from the front of the case, past the hard drives, and then blown out the rear. There's maybe 5mm space between the drives so airflow is unimpeded. At 22c ambient, my idle drive temps vary from 24c to 27c. Not bad!      As I said earlier, I'm happy. The case is very compact (about 300x260x265 mm), holds eight 3.5" drives, two 2.5" SSDs, and runs cool. For about $180, which included shipping to Massachusetts, I think it was a good purchase. That said, it isn't perfect:      No cable management features.      No fans are included, you must provide your own.      Standard ATX PSU are supported but IMHO are impractical due to the larger PSU size and longer cables. Cable management would be a mess.      FYI, the case has one USB 3.0 Type A port and one USB-C port on the front. Both of these are wired to the same USB 3.0 motherboard cable so the USB-C port will be limited to USB 3.0 speeds (5 Gbps). I.e. the USB-C port is wired to a USB 3.0 port on the motherboard.</Content></post><post><Title>What are expected SMART values for Seagate Recertified Drives?</Title><Author>u/ELO_Space</Author><Content>I recently bought a Seagate Ironwolf Pro Recertified drive (ST18000nt001), and the SMART results are worrying me a bit..

It's going to either run Plex directly, or host files for Plex (still figuring that part out). I selected the Silverstone CS382 for the case, because I liked it size; that it had 8x hot swap drive bays; has a slot for a slim ODD so that I can do some limited BDR rips for cold storage; and that the motherboard tray is inverted, potentially allowing for full-length GPUs if I decide to run Plex directly (I end up transcoding a lot because I need subtitles on). The only thing I don't really care for is that the largest motherboard it can accept is mATX, which has less to do with the size and more to do with current trends that exist on modern mATX boards.      Basically, most modern mATX boards seem to sacrifice SATA port count in favor of dedicating the PCIe lanes to NVMe slots instead. I get it: between their speed and lack of cables, NVMe are pretty neat (*rim shot*), but not really what I need for this build. It seems that most mATX boards top out around 4x SATA ports (LGA 1700 Intel mATX boards seem to top out at 4x; some AM5 AMD mATX boards will go up to 6x, but most are 4x), and instead offer 2-3x NVMe slots instead. So what I am wondering is this:      Has anyone tried using SATA add-on cards in a situation like this? Not a RAID card, just "here is some SATA ports and a chip a tie them into the PCIe lanes".      I've found a couple of items like the Vantec M.2 PCIe Gen3x2 to 5 ports SATA III expansion card that look like they might get me up to 9x SATA ports, which will be enough to get me my 8x hotswap bays operational and the slim ODD drive. But what I am concerned about is that 4x of the SATA ports will be "proper" ones on the motherboard and 5x will be "add-ons", and I am not sure how that might affect a RAID 5 or 6 array.      Side note that may change people's answers: there is a non-zero chance that if I decide to run Plex directly on this box, I may just make it a server running Ubuntu or Windows instead, and figure out either a software RAID 5 or 6, JBOD, or just plain drives and remote backup.</Content></post><post><Title>Backup to Google drive</Title><Author>u/Low_Start_3087</Author><Content>Trying to sync 5Tb 500k files to Google drive with Win10 desktop apps.

This is really just files and directories organized in a loose way such that different branches of the family can read or write to their "sub-trees". This is mainly photos, pdfs, and plain text or markdown with stories, history, and metadata.      I'm primarily using Google drive (and groups and contacts) to manage all this. I realized I need to trust google less and create a 321-backup as in https://www.veeam.com/blog/321-backup-rule.html "three copies, two media types, one off-site".  Note that "for two media types" here means more than one provider service (i.e. not just google).      Questions:      Do you use a storage service that looks similar, with plain old: files, folders, users, groups, permissions (read, write, admin) that you're happy with?  That covers this requirement      Do you have a good automated way to copy from google drive to create backups periodically?  That preserves security data (possibly versioning too). This could be to my own RAID/NAS at home.      Is there any service in the cloud that backs up directly from google drive for you (for a price) that works well?      Encryption: do you know of a seamless service that allows one to automatically add a layer of zero-trust security to particular folders on google drive (or elsewhere). E.g. Some documents are financial and sensitive enough that we'd like extra security, but it's a big pain to encrypt/decrypt these locally then upload/download to the shared area.      Thanks for any insights!</Content></post><post><Title>A PWL solution that worked for me, and alternative drives</Title><Author>u/flossy_cake</Author><Content>I have the 12TB WD Red Plus drive.  It thumps every 5 seconds due to PWL.  It is annoying.  I was able to shut it up with this specific type of anti shock bracket which suspends the drive on rubber posts from all 4 sides.   You will need a 5.25" bay in your PC case which are getting rarer these days.   Available at the usual places like ebay, amazon, aliexpress etc.    WARNING:  do not necessarily expect it to be a miracle solution for you straight away.  I have two 5.25" bays and if I mount it in the top one I can still hear the thump.  If I use the bottom bay it is completely silent.   I don't know why.  I think it is something to do with resonation inside the case.   In the bottom silent bay I can put my ear right up to it and I hear no thump at all.  I can't explain it.  There is some trick to getting the drive suspended in just the right way that makes it not transfer any vibration.  I have read on some silent PC review site that people were suspending their drives in mid air inside the case with elastic bands.  Maybe it's like that.   When you are mounting the drive on the posts, inspect each post to make sure each one is making a perfect circular maximal contact patch on all 4 sides.  If one of the posts is bending slightly its contact patch will be smaller. It is easy to be slightly off and I think that affects how much vibration gets damped.      Now for the alternatives:  I have two Western Digital 8TB blues (current model) which seem to not have PWL thump that I can tell.  Maybe they do, but I cannot hear it.   Or maybe it does it so rarely and quietly that I cannot tell it is happening.   But the 8TB blues have more platter spinning whoosh noise like "hhhhhhhhhh" so the 12TB red plus with silenced PWL is actually quieter.      I will keep playing around with my top bay to get to the bottom of why it's still thumping despite the rubber mount.  Maybe one of the rubber posts went out of alignment or something.  I have it in the bottom bay right now and I can tell you there is no thump at all, none.  The drive has not gone to sleep.      I was going to buy a second 12TB WD Red Plus but then I thought if they both thump every 5 seconds there is no guarantee both their thumps would be in sync so it could actually result in a thump every 2.5 seconds!   Imagine having four of them, it would be a thump every 1.25 seconds, oh my goodness!</Content></post><post><Title>(cross-post from HN) When would 1GB HDD have cost $100?</Title><Author>u/stevecondy123</Author><Content>Someone's trying to track down when a 1GB HDD would have cost $100.

I should have bought a 8 bay nas but only purchased a four bay. I currently run plex off a ds418. 2x8tb and 2x18tb hybrid raid. I also have a 10tb currently not being used. Not sure what my next step should be      Buy a two bay raid enclosure and a 10tb drive. This should last me a couple years. However I'm not sure what to get and if this may cause some lag while streeming.      Buy 2x18tb drives or larger. Then I will have 3 drives not doing anything. This seems like a big waste until I upgrade my Nas which should be in a few years      2.Replace my Nas with a 8bay nas and buy another 10tb drive. This is not my favorite option as this will be the most expensive. My current Nas I would have to find a good home for.      Somthing else to note is that my pc already has plenty of hd space. My goal is to use my pc for sorting and move all data to the Nas for storage.      Any thoughts or suggestions would be appreciated.</Content></post><post><Title>How to save a redgifs GIF</Title><Author>u/Dragonkindren1</Author><Content>Just change the watch in the url to ifr and then right click and save video</Content></post><post><Title>I have a horrible confession to make</Title><Author>u/ByteArchivist</Author><Content>I love deleting things.

My name’s Tiger, and I’m struggling to keep my data stored.      Every external storage device I’ve purchased has eventually had to be sent to repair services and be promptly replaced within a two to four year span - I’m now on my third harddrive, and have decided that I need a change to my approach.      I am a college student with tons of personal digital memorabilia, from movies to OSTs and historical documents. After a period of time, the drives I’ve bought have consistently taken ages to mount &amp;amp; unmount, face a myriad of widely-spanning technical problems, and then promptly refuse to work. This has led to the decision that they will never, ever leave my areas of residence for fear of some whimsically-inclined failure. So I’m down on my luck, and thought I’d ask y’all for help since you folk seem dedicated enough to have some tips!! :D      I suppose a list of what I’m generally looking for in a storage device would be helpful:      Can be safely relocated, but incredibly rarely      Can be accessed with immediacy (ie direct cables and not network shenanigans)      Loads files at an incredibly accessible speed      Preferably functions out of the box, some set-up is fine if it needs updates or a wizard, hesitant if it requires additional purchases      Doesn’t require a 24/7 connection to a computer      Is not OS-dependant, can be formatted to be read by anything      Offers 5TB of storage or more      Thank y’all so much for reading!!

This feature is now removed entirely with no plan to return after I have only had the "lifetime" plan for 2 months. I understand things change, so I reached out to politely request a refund and they said it was out of the 30 day window for a refund. So I am 60 days into a "lifetime" subscription and they will not do even a partial refund, after they removed the most important feature they sold me.      Amazing business plan, offer many wonderful features and then remove them once you have customers money.      I would like to point out that the photo upload worked terribly and inconsistently to begin with, and I really should have canceled much sooner, but I wanted to give a new company the benefit of the doubt. Also they recently released webdav, but it requires running your own server, which kind of defeats the purpose of webdav. Practically every other service lets you upload many different ways and deal with your own encryption.      I made a terrible mistake and am out $1000. I should have listened to people's warnings that Internxt was not good, and that it was a waste of money. I really was foolish and Internxt did an evil bait and switch.      Do not give Internxt your money! pcloud, icecloud, koofr are all much more qualified companies</Content></post><post><Title>How susceptible are stored, unpowered hard drives to vibrations from a subwoofer?</Title><Author>u/Gamba_Kufu_of_Huru</Author><Content>So I have a little home theater with a 12" subwoofer, and in the same room, around 3 meters away is where my hard drives are stored, in a drawer. For security reasons they need to be in this room so they can't simply be moved for now.      I never play any music or movies or anything when they're plugged in and in use of course. I just want to know if they are safe from the vibrations when stored away. I listen at pretty reasonable volumes I think but ofc some movies can get very loud and bassy.      They work and I have no issues or anything, it's just me being the big worrier I am am wondering if they somehow may be getting some subtle damage over time that may cause issues down the line or reduce the lifespan etc.</Content></post><post><Title>People with really big music collections, how do you even load them in your music player?</Title><Author>u/inhalingsounds</Author><Content>I was thinking about this.

Currently I have an rsync script that runs continuosly monitoring for changes looped in a bash script with --partial to pick up where it left off.      However this is more of a hack. rsync is more a syrnconisation tool than a dedicated network transfer tool. So while it works great, it has issues resulting from frequent dropouts. It works okay but I'm after something more robust that can withtstand network dropouts.      To complicate matters, the NAS is running (ReFS)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ReFS], the machines which generate the data run window10, others run weird Centos DE and finally the last one is ubuntu. All transfer to the ReFS. Ideally the tool would work on Windows/Linux/MacOS.

I did my research and narrowed it down to Synology 923+ to start my data hoarding journey however I recently came across a PC built to use as NAS.      Now, because of this, I am a bit confused as to which one should I go for since the PC helps me save a lot of money. However, I am not that knowledgeable when it comes to using NAS via TrueNAS, maintaining my NAS-related PC setup etc. I have used a Windows PC Tower (with monitor) in the past but I only used it for 7 years (without any major issues) and changed to a laptop.      It will be really helpful to know if the PC setup given below is a good choice for its price, good for my use case and if it will consume too much power as a NAS or not. This person is looking for $240 (probably can give the system to me for $220). Below are the system specs with my comments in (brackets):      CPU: AMD Phenom II X6 1055T 6 Core Processor      Memory: 16GB (4x4GB) DDR3 (brand not mentioned)      HBA: LSI SAS[hidden information]i Flashed to IT Mode and acted as a HBA (no idea what this is)      Supports 8x SATA/SAS 6gb/s Drives.

LTO-5 has a rated capacity of 1.5TB (1.36TiB). When I've been writing data to these tapes (uncompressed) and they seem to cap at 1300 GiB which seems to be ~90GiB short.

I had 5 installed on the card that all worked fine. I bought 3 new drives but they aren't being detected. I've tried changed cables with no effect. I've tried adding one at a time, nothing. I'm only seeing the original 5 no matter what I do. I thought maybe unplugging and old one and trying a new one could potentially let me know if I had too many, but then only the 4 drives showed up. They don't show up with fdisk -l, the don't show up in disks or gparted. I tried a USB enclosure to initialize them to see if that would help, and they did initialize, but once connected back to SATA, they don't show up.

You can pay in money but lower your costs by providing storage in return in a P2P fashion.      I truly believe these kinds of services will only get better and are a big part of the future of the internet and data storage.

I am sure I corrupted something by ending the process, but it ended on one of the windows that asked to clear space to continue. So it was on a single file rather than in the middle of a file. I clicked skip for all remaining and it froze, it was quite a lot of files. I closed the window because it was frozen, and now it wont show me the files on the drive.      It will load, show me the remaining space taken up, but wont load any files when I actually open the drive in explorer.</Content></post><post><Title>Best practices with Terracopy? Verify and checksum?</Title><Author>u/Bern_Down_the_DNC</Author><Content>First time using Teracopy. I was recommended to use this since I can check "verify files" and it will do that after copying files on drive 1 and syncing to drive 2.      Nobody said anything about checksum files. Not sure if it would be beneficial. I will rename files or add more files to the directory later on drive 1, then sync all the files to drive 2 again.      If I need to do checksum, would I create a checksum for folders on drive 1, then start copy and sync to drive 2 but select "do checksum at the end" so it generates a second checksum on drive 2 that I can compare to the checksum from drive 1?      Also do I need to choose "store/verify checksum on ADS"? (And should I use xx3-64 instead of MD5 now?)

And now the intrusive thoughts of replacing them with a somewhat modern solution are starting to appear.      Just started researching about tape drives, and the first quarter of rabbit's hole is promising.      They do seem like the best backup solution ever. I can find brand new LTO-4 1.6TB tapes for like $12. Drive goes for about $200. There are better tapes which go from 5 to 10TB, but their drives are also more expensive.      I love the concept, though. Tapes are pure media, like DVD-RW drives. No electronics on them. They won't die because a spindle motor or a controller chip failed, or a bit flipped in the flash chip holding the firmware. Tapes are ancient retro tech thriving in the solid state age.

I believe it would be best not to use a raid setup since it seems silly to have multiple drives running for basically USB 2.0 transfer speeds (Just fast enough to play Blue Rays), and I already have a backup of that data.      Preferably some external solution, a power cable, and a USB A output so it would be easy to plug into my media box      For now, I've been using a few USB thumb drives, which did the job. They were slow to transfer too and one of them died (tho it was easy to get it replaced via the manufacturer).      So I'm basically thinking about some smaller ssd, nvme setup (2tb each drive), but I'm having a hard time finding one that isn't just a single ssd or single nvme enclosure.      External hard drives also didn't sound so bad. Still, if I wanted a bigger capacity I would be stuck with Seagate One Touch Hubs and the question of how long will it last. In contrast, external SSDs seemed bad since they cost like 100 euros per 1tb while a decent 2tb nvme costs around 120 euros (150 euros if where count the enclosure).</Content></post><post><Title>Writing family photos to BD-R directly with file explorer in Windows 10?

Using existing drives in external storage without reformatting.</Title><Author>u/PyrolyticCarbon</Author><Content>Hi all.      I've been researching and asking questions regarding NAS drives, and I thought I'd chosen a NAS to purchase. Then, just before I buy, I see that it formats the drives you're installing and there's no way round it, something I can't do.      I have an 512Gb SSD and two 1TB HDDs filled with data in my old PC. I have a new mini PC and I had hoped to move these into a NAS and access them as is, no reformatting, no RAID - although I may buy another drive and drop it in a 4-bay solution and mirror to that, I have no need or desire for reformatting these drives currently, nor to move to a RAID solution.

Historically, I’ve had the following USB spinning hard drives (all 2.5”):  - WD My Passport: 1 TB: personal stuff and old files, as this was my first external drive; this includes photos, videos, class recordings, old images and screenshots, music, software from the 90s and early 2000… stuff that I don’t want to get rid of. It’s at 80% full.  - Toshiba Canvio Basics (1TB): Movie backups, classified by genre, and game backups. 96% capacity.  - Toshiba Canvio Basics (yes, I love how good and reliable this model is) (2TB): Series, documentaries and anime backups, as well as other content from the internet such as podcasts or video-podcasts. It’s at 60% of its capacity.  - Re-used Hitachi drive (256GB): it’s health is low, but it still works, I use it as the only ExFAT drive if I need to use it on a machine that doesn’t support my current files system (APFS). It has a lot of random stuff.            Now, those are the traditional spinning external drives I’ve always had. On the other hand, during the recent years, thanks to different sales, I’ve managed to get the following Samsung T5 and T7 SSDs.      My plan when I got this new T5 and T7 Samsung SSDs was to be able to carry with me the same information but with much less weight, and keep the older 2.5” hard drives as a long term storage/backup, without actually using them unless when I want to back up something very important.      My new portable SSDs are the following:  -T5 500GB: I intend to use it to carry it with me to the university, store class recordings (including video) that usually take 1GB each, and my device has only 128GB on board. I want to use it as a high performance pen-drive.  -T5 1TB: here, I’d thought to store the same personal data, such as photos or videos or old files that I already have on my WD My Passport (1TB)  - T7 2TB: intended to use as a media SSD, because of it’s big size. However, I’m not sure if I should use it to store my academical recordings (remember, ~1GB per file), or just put there my favorite movie and series backups. Or maybe both? But having already 1TB 2.5” HDD just for movies, and another 2TB 2.5” HDD for series+anime backups and other Internet video content such as videopodcasts, I’m not sure if putting here my favorite content (duplicate) is wasting this 2TB SSD.  -T7 Shield 4TB: And when I thought I had enough SSDs to fulfill my needs… I saw a sale on the T7 Shield 4TB SSD, at less than half the price. Obviously, I had to get it. So now I have this 4TB SSD that I can carry with me with EVERYTHING I have on the other SSDs, in just one drive.      However, when I go to the Uni, the SSD I want to carry with me is the T5 500GB. It’s the cheapest and everything on it will -hopefully- be backed up.  My main doubt is (option A) wether to use the T5 1TB SSD for personal stuff that I already have on the WD My PassPort, but that’s not data I use too much. In this case I would use the 2TB SSD for my classes (long term) AND my favorite media content such as movies and shows.  The alternative (option B) is to use the T5 1TB for storing my classes long term (short term is what the 500GB is for), and leave the 2TB SSD just for non-personal media.      In this case (option B), among the personal data from the WD drive, I could make a selection, i.e. all my personal photos and memories and PDFs and documents, and put them on the 4TB drive along with the media stuff and my uni stuff to have everything in one drive.            I could also use this 4TB SSD to sort all the duplicates I have on every hard drive, which I suspect they are a lot. I think it’s easier having all in one drive.      Don’t worry about privacy, as I’m formatting all the T5 and T7 with encryption and a 16-20 character long password, a different one for each drive.        How would you use the 4 SSDs if you were me?    You can also comment on my hardware if you want. The Toshiba Canvio Basic were cheap and extraordinarily reliable and silent hard drives that still work perfectly after more than 10 years.</Content></post><post><Title>Any way to make a cheap docking station or something similar?</Title><Author>u/BiggieChezes</Author><Content>I have a few smaller 256GB, and 512GB scrap hard drives.

I will put 6 16TB drives in it. I'll be using Softraid with it, thus my next question:      since softraid doesn't do raid 6 yet, what flavor would you recommend for me?

And now the intrusive thoughts of replacing them with a somewhat modern solution are starting to appear.      Just started researching about tape drives, and the first quarter of rabbit's hole is promising.      They do seem like the best backup solution ever. I can find brand new LTO-4 1.6TB tapes for like $12. Drive goes for about $200. There are better tapes which go from 5 to 10TB, but their drives are also more expensive.      I love the concept, though. Tapes are pure media, like DVD-RW drives. No electronics on them. They won't die because a spindle motor or a controller chip failed, or a bit flipped in the flash chip holding the firmware. Tapes are ancient retro tech thriving in the solid state age.

I believe it would be best not to use a raid setup since it seems silly to have multiple drives running for basically USB 2.0 transfer speeds (Just fast enough to play Blue Rays), and I already have a backup of that data.      Preferably some external solution, a power cable, and a USB A output so it would be easy to plug into my media box      For now, I've been using a few USB thumb drives, which did the job. They were slow to transfer too and one of them died (tho it was easy to get it replaced via the manufacturer).      So I'm basically thinking about some smaller ssd, nvme setup (2tb each drive), but I'm having a hard time finding one that isn't just a single ssd or single nvme enclosure.      External hard drives also didn't sound so bad. Still, if I wanted a bigger capacity I would be stuck with Seagate One Touch Hubs and the question of how long will it last. In contrast, external SSDs seemed bad since they cost like 100 euros per 1tb while a decent 2tb nvme costs around 120 euros (150 euros if where count the enclosure).</Content></post><post><Title>Writing family photos to BD-R directly with file explorer in Windows 10?

It connects via USBC) that I saw on sale along with 4 24TB Seagate drives. My idea was to then use Windows Storage Spaces to create a pool and mirror the drives to add redundancy.      But then I saw a lot of people on here really don't like Storage Spaces which sent me down a rabbit hole of Googling and reading threads which involved a million acronyms and other words and names I don't understand and now I'm thoroughly confused. Like what's the difference between a DAS and a JBOD? What's a Home Lab? What's ZFS? (I'm just asking these to show the kind of research mess I've ended up in, don't feel the need to spend paragraphs answering them.)      Is Storage Spaces good enough for what I want? Will it easily allow me to add more drives to the pool down the line? Did I buy the wrong thing? Should I have done something else?</Content></post><post><Title>how to check are files good or damaged?</Title><Author>u/oO0_</Author><Content>i do simple backups.

It took a while for me to really understand the options, software raid vs hardware, how many bays I needed, the limitations of  it, etc. So I've settled on the Terramaster 6 bay DAS  D6-320. I will put 6 16TB drives in it. I'll be using Softraid with it, thus my next question:      since softraid doesn't do raid 6 yet, what flavor would you recommend for me? I need at least one disk failure protection, but wouldn't hate two. I don't understand what some of the raid options mean by "at least one disk protection" fwiw.

If you're wondering why it's anything special, it's the largest reasonably quiet HD if you're looking for a low noise solution compared to the typical enterprise HD.      I logged into my WD account and added 5 to my cart.  Checked back a couple of times over a few hours and WD ended up emailing me a 15% off one time discount code to finish checking out.  I'm also receiving 18% rewards on Western Digital through Capital One Shopping (after window shopping Western Digital site a few times on the app).  Not sure if this is normal or some special push for Memorial Day Weekend.

For years I have also used online backup. I've used IDrive in recent years (I've seen some complaints here, but I've found it to be fine, if a bit clunky) and Carbonite before that.      But with my IDrive renewal coming up, I have wondered if having both Google Drive and IDrive are redundant. Years ago, I recall reading that online backup was still necessary because cloud storage wasn't reliable. But it seems like cloud storage has come a long way in terms of reliability and features, like file versioning and retrieval in case of loss.      I've looked extensively and been surprised not to find much information on that question. Is there a consensus? (I should add that I also back up to an external hard drive so I do maintain multiple copies.)</Content></post><post><Title>Just bought a 1TB Samsung 980 PRO.

So I am looking to Seagate to see if you offer 14+TB drives that do not have regular PWL thump sounds. I dont care about access noise nor motor whirr noise but PWL every 5 secs is like Chinese Water Torture! The ONLY issue is regular Pre-emptive Wear Levelling noises - and NOT access or drive noiseSeagate Agent:Upon checking with the concern technical team, our technical team requested to inform you that, you will get a minimum sound with a lite vibration in our drives. As this sound will occur in all the hard drives, It will not be unusual like WD and this sound will not be disturbing to you. Other than that you can buy any Seagate drives according to the capacity and usage. PWL sounds will not occur in Seagate. But you can hear some minimum sort of sound and vibration can be heard slightly when the drive is in a silent room. You need not worry, you will not face any PWL sound issue in Seagate.Me:Second question: what is the best large drive that copes with regular power cycles? In my usage, the drive will be attached to a USB external dock cabinet which powers down the drive after 20 mins of non-use. This will occur 20 times a day, Out of the SG range, what copes best?Seagate Agent:Upon checking, Seagate does not recommend to use the drives in the USB dock or using splitters or any other external connectors.

I needed a new one because I was having corruption trouble with the 1TB flash drive that I'd been using. Anything I backed up to the 1TB drive would be corrupted upon reconnecting the drive to my laptop  There wasn't much on the 1TB drive, but I did have a lot of videos downloaded from YT that were clean. I thought the corruption might've been carried over, so I decided to alphabetically re download all the videos onto the 2 TB drive. Re downloading the videos going fine until I hit a bit of a snag.      I'd gotten to the R and S part of the video title alphabet. After I pasted some video files onto the 2TB drive I noticed there was external corruption being caused. I know this because I tried to paste a rar of the pc version of neversoft's spider-man game onto the drive (It was the lightest game I could think of) and the archive ended up being corrupt. I can tell when it's a clean paste, because the rar will paste slowly and the green meter resembles a set of waves, but when it's a corrupted paste, it'll look more like a straight line. I took those files off the drive, re pasted the archive and the rar was just fine. I re downloaded the files, some of them were copied to the drive and didn't cause any corruption, but others would still cause corruption. I even pasted some video files from the 1TB drive and some of them would be fine, but others would have the same corruption result.      I don't know if this is malware related or if it has something to do with the allocation unit size, But I have no idea how to fix it. And what's worse is that I have no way of knowing which files the 2TB drive will accept or not. I can't back anything up until this is fixed and my desktop doesn't have enough space. Any help at all will be appreciated.</Content></post><post><Title>Is it better to sleep drives or leave them spinning in between infrequent uses?</Title><Author>u/Streetamp_Lamoose</Author><Content>I'm pretty new to using larger drive arrays and this seemed like the kind of place where people have things figured out. My apologies if this is basic knowledge, but my internet searching didn't seem to reveal a consensus.I have a Mac Studio that I use as my main machine with 14+ Tb (out of 36Tb total) of mostly RAW photos stored on a 4-Bay OWC Thunderbay enclosure (Raid 5 via SoftRaid). This enclosure is directly connected to the mac via a Thunderbolt 3 (type-C connector) to the Mac. What drives me crazy is that, for reasons unknown to me, all day everyday, the drives seem to be spinning up, spinning down, spinning up, spinning down. Rest for 2 minutes, then spin up again and down again. I had been sleeping the Mac and allowing it to sleep my disks, but no matter what settings I tried it always woke from sleep about every 5 minutes, and would spin up the drive array, only to immediately go back to sleep and deactivate them. After about 2 years of this, My Hitachi drives eventually had catastrophic failures, and corrupted HFS+ volumes. I was able to recover most of the data from various backup schemes. I decided to replace the 4 drives with Segate Datacenter Exos Enterprise drives, thinking that I would change my approach and never allow the mac to sleep (just the displays). I hoped this would mean that the drives would stay powered up and always spinning, so hopefully avoiding the massive wear and tear I was getting before through constant power cycling and mechanical acceleration. My plan seems to be failing. I never sleep the Mac, and I've tried every setting I can find in the UI menus. Even if I haven't touched the machine in days, it is still spinning up, spinning down, spinning up, spinning down every minute or so. And to make matters worse, these Enterprise drives are LOUD. My poor daughter, who tries to sleep in the room next to my computer can hear the drives all night "Growling" at her, crunching, and spasming and spinning loudly, even when I haven't asked to access the volumes in days. I know modern OS'es run things in the background, like indexing, Time Machine, search optimization, caching stuff, etc. But is it really so constant? And why can't I seem to prevent the drives from ever turning off, which I assume (power waste aside) would be better for the health of the drives?I just want to have a large Raid 5 drive directly connected to my desktop machine, with a fast connection for things like 8k video editing, and not feel like the drives are constantly power cycling themselves into an early grave.

Following guides online, I expanded the pool and now in the specifications it tells me that I have a Capacity of 65.45TB, Allocated 64.21TB and Unallocated 1.24TB.      My DataVol1 (I have just a single volume), after the resize to increase the volume to the maximum possible size, has a Capacity of 62.99TB.      Is it normal to have 1.24TB more on the pool that I cannot use to increase further the capacity of my volume? Can I use it in any way?      Also, since today I used always a Thick volume.

So i chose to use Kiwix using the .zim file from:  https://download.kiwix.org/zim/wikipedia/,  en_all_maxi_2024-01.zim.      Downloading it is all fine and great, And in fact once it is downloaded on either of my computers (Yes, I tried on both my laptop and on my desktop.) I am able to open it using Kiwix and read it.      But obviously I want to keep the zim file safe so I can have it ready at a moments notice without needing to download it every time... So I've tried to put it on my SSD.      SO I guess the issue I'm having is when I try to copy the .zim file onto my disk, it seemingly went fine with no obvious mistakes. But then I disconnect the external ssd from my Desktop and connect it to my laptop to open it there (my way of testing if it is being kept safe on the disk.) and everytime some specific new error shows up when I try to open it in Kiwix. Sometimes its outright corrupted, sometimes it's missing articles. Like putting it on the SSD corrupted the .zim file somehow. Which would be a bummer because this external ssd  is new and works like a charm usually, its just somehow not working for this specific file.      A few notes:I have already tried compressing the file into .7r or .zip. Same type of corruption occurs after interacting with the SSD.      The SSD: 1TB, connected to my computer using a usb-c to USB cable. it is external.      I already ran "chkdsk D: /f"  for the disk to check for any bad sectors, but the program reported zero bad sectors and said everything is fine.      I have also tried to reformat the drive to both NTFS and exFat. Nothing works. I'm so dissapointed. And feel stupid. Please help me, thank you!

Enterprise? ~20+ tb</Title><Author>u/theseawoof</Author><Content>Noticed that these drives tend to be the ones that easily have up to 24tb or so. I need a large HDD of around 20-24tb to hold my music and video software, VSTs, samples, video footage and assets, etc. Right now my case is maxed out with HDDs and I've had two consumer Seagate drives fail within recent years. I am willing to spend the ~$500 for one drive of high capacity if there is no downside.      Someone recommended WD Purple, saying that surveillance drives hold up to constant usage, but someone else mentioned that they have a slightly lower read speed. What would you choose for something if high capacity and longevity that is going to hold up to usage and not just general storage?</Content></post><post><Title>How to extract raw files from multiple DVDs at the same time?</Title><Author>u/TRUE_BIT</Author><Content>I have approx 6k DVDs that need the raw files extracted from them.

I only use it to store old photos and video that I don't want to lose but also for Time Machine backups.      A few months ago one ofthe drives died so I got a replacement (see below). The raid rebuilt itself in a few days and I thought it was golden again. A week or two goes by and the other drive dies. So I get another of the same drive replace/rebuild and figured NOW I'm golden.      Fast fwd to now, I've got another drive failure. This is getting pretty old.  So I guess I'm just looking for some advice. Should I keep trusting this WD enclosure and get yet another replacement drive? Should I abandon it and switch to something else? I really just don't want to lose this data.      I'd like to just shove all this data into Google Drive and be done with external enclosures for this but ~8TB is a lot to upload and would take my little uplink weeks or months to do so and it seems likely that my one remaining drive would fail in that timeframe :-(      Replacement drives were both: Western Digital 8TB WD Red Plus NAS Internal Hard Drive HDD - 5640 RPM, SATA 6 Gb/s, CMR, 256 MB Cache, 3.5" - WD80EFPX</Content></post><post><Title>I want to automatically back up the contents of one external hard drive to another in a different house.

I already have the data on my local machine (macbook pro) and an external harddrive, but I want an online storage solution as well.      I have used aws S3 before (for my work) so I have some knowledge. I could make a bucket to store the data.      Is there any interesting (free) software I can use (on a mac) to backup some folders to s3. I have mountainduck on my laptop but only in trial.      Another possible solution is to create a bash script to upload specific folders to s3 (not necessarily aws, could also be digitalocean) on an regular basis. I could possibly make a script with rclone, is this a good usecase for this?

I started off with a Synology DS920+ in 2020, equipped it with 4x6 TB drives, and soon found myself upgrading to 4x10 TB drives as my media and container needs grew. I've been heavily using PLEX, SONARR, RADARR, among other containers, and it's been fantastic so far.      However, I'm now planning to dive into 4K transcoding, enhance my setup with more RAM for network labs, and maybe even host a gaming server. The demand on my current system is skyrocketing, and once again, I'm running out of space.      I'm contemplating building a custom PC since the price seems comparable to getting an 8-bay Synology unit, but I'm really hung up on finding the right case. I'd prefer something that isn't a tower due to space constraints and aesthetics, but most importantly, I need it to support hot swapping. As my data hoarding isn't slowing down any time soon, I want to easily add more drives and replace any that fail without shutting down the system.      Has anyone here tackled a similar upgrade or built their own high-capacity, hot-swappable storage system? I'd love to hear about your experiences, particularly about your choice of cases and any setup tips you might have for someone looking to transition from a NAS to a custom build.

Did I make a mistake getting the WUH721816ALE6L1 not the ALE04 or is the drive from ServerPartDeals bad? The L1 is a "self-encrypting drive". It's supposed to be "refurbished" by WDC and has a new WDC label that says "Recertified 12 NOV 2023" and P/N 0F24861  FW:870.      I previously bought two 14TB  WUH721414ALE604 drives from Amazon before I learned of ServerPartDeals.com here (thanks guys!). I ran Spinrite 6.1 Level 5 on both. Each took about almost a week to do. Level 5 checks every sector, recovers (if possible) unreadable data, inverts it, writes it, reads it, verifies it, then rewrites and re-verifies each sector. One of them was fine and the other had some bad sectors at the very end so I returned it.      I was thinking I should have bought a 16TB one, so after returning the 14TB to Amazon, I bought the WUH721816ALE6L1 from ServerPartDeals on Friday and got it today, Monday. Free 2nd Day Air. Very cool! I especially liked that they say it's "Manufacturer Recertified".      Spinrite can see the drive and reads it's configuration from the drive electronics. It knows it's 16TB and how many bytes and sectors it has. It tests every drive it can recognize to be sure it can read and write sectors on each drive. However when it tests the 16TB drive to verify it can read and write the drive's sectors, that fails.      I've tried this on two different systems with the same result. I did a quick test in Linux trying to 'dd' another drive to it, but it complained it can't access the drive saying that maybe it is DRM'd. The same 'dd' command works just fine with the 14TB drive.      Is there something I need to do to the drive to make it work or is it just bad and needs to be returned?

Thankfully, no data lost!      I'm trying to figure out the best solution for myself going forward. Should I go NAS for storage and grab a mini-pc (N100 Beelink or similar) for the living room?

They are not listed      To those who wonder why the height is important, max 15mm height for 2.5" drives has been the standard for may years and is the largest height allowed in 2.5" enclosures.      The 5TB MyPassport case is 19.2mm and the drive is 15mm. The 6TB is 20.6mm so the drive is probably 16 or 16.5mm to accommodate the additional platter. I suspect this may allow them to fit snuggly in some 15mm cases. For reference, the lowest height 3.5" drive is 19.5mm.  https://documents.westerndigital.com/content/dam/doc-library/en_us/assets/public/wd/product/external-storage/my_passport/my-passport-phdd-usb-c/data-sheet-my-passport-phdd-usb-c.pdfhttps://documents.westerndigital.com/content/dam/doc-library/en_us/assets/public/wd/product/external-storage/wd-black-p10-game-drive-for-xbox-usb-3-2-hdd/data-sheet-wd-black-p10-game-drive-for-xbox-usb-3-2-hdd.pdf    Pricewise, the "bargain" ;-p, is the Elements SE at 169.99MSRP, vs $129.99 for the 5TB.</Content></post><post><Title>Powering down archive pools when not in use.</Title><Author>u/dtf_0</Author><Content>I was wondering if any NAS hardware/software allows a user to configure powering-down drives/enclosures for storage pools designed for archiving.      I am a robotics engineer. I have a lot of old sensor data that is used very infrequently. Whenever we release a new release, we run a simulation against old data to ensure there are no regressions. However, this data is only touched at max 30 days per year.      Currently, I manually turn on my archive NAS when need, run my test, move any new data to the archive, and power down the NAS manually.      I am curious if there is any hardware or software that can do this automatically. I am thinking of something like a disk enclosure or disk shelf that contains an 'archive pool.' When I access the archive pool, the enclosure powers up, attaches the pool to the NAS, and works as normal. Then, after some delay, the pool detaches and powers down.      This is more about power consumption than wear and tear. I currently average about ten years of life out of my drives. They start their lives as constantly spinning drives in my primary NAS, and then when I replace those drives with larger ones, they move to the archive NAS, which runs infrequently.</Content></post><post><Title>hgst 12tb refurbished not going standby</Title><Author>u/zannare</Author><Content>I recently purchased a refurbished HGST 12tb hard disk (HUH721212ALE601) to use as an additional parity disk in my Snapraid setupit seems to work well, the smart is ok and completed the sync without problems (about 23 hours) but I was unable to make it go to standby automaticallyI tried all the APM values from 1 to 127 (default was 254) but nothing changesI tried various settings of the time in which it should go to standy with smartctl, but nothingmanual standy works with both smartctl and hdparmthe hard disk makes a "tick" every 5 secondshttps://vocaroo.com/148gEPXcUo36</Content></post><post><Title>Any Advice - Sabrent 5 bay docking station upgrade</Title><Author>u/SCDUDELEX</Author><Content>Current status:  Using the 5 Bay station... been working very well (and yes have a 6 Bay NAS as well, different functions in my system):      I need to expand the bay capacity and assuming others have gotten to this point.

Recently, I subscribed to a website with some embedded SketchFab models available for viewing and interaction. Resultingly, it appears that I have been granted (for an expensive and limited time) indirect access to a very rich repository of engineering models that feature various diagrams, cutaways, animations, and annotations.      This access allows for interacting with a variety of models, viewing associated educational annotations, and watching demonstrative animations that illustrate the working principles of the modeled object.      Using Chrome, via the Network tab, I am able to see some line items of interest. These are firstly, *.binz files, alongside what appear to my eye to be associated texture maps, normal files, and so on as a variety of .jpeg files. There are also links to the sketchfab.com domain and similarly structured API calls.      I am aware and have investigated the path leading to .binz extraction and conversion. That is not what I'm interested in. It is not a raw 3D model that I am seeking, it is this comprehensive experience. Having access to the base model is all well and good, but what I would like to do is preserve this "SketchFab Viewer" experience even after my membership ends with this website.      So, I would like to ask assistance.  If possible, could pointers be provided to a way for me to preserve offline the material I currently have access to? Alternatively, is there a method to somehow extract a SketchFab link that will persist after my membership expires?

The drive itself is working and connected via FC using a QLE2562 PCI-E.      My plan was to original create a SAS RAID 0 to temp store the files being written to tape from the offline HDDs but I've had issues with the P410 controller not working so for now will have to connect the offline SATA drives to the server (Proliant ML330 G6).      The drives I'm using aren't fast (ST3500312CS) but I did a read speed test using dd if=mytestfile of=/dev/null bs=1M count=1024 and they're getting around 80-90/MBs and online speed results show roughly the same. It's not fast but should be enough to do one backup copy before trying to fix the SAS issue.      I've timed how long it's taking for it to do each file and the results:  File 1 - 309 seconds - 10,045,430,602 bytes ~32.5/MBsFile 2 - 291 seconds - 13,597,137,146 bytes ~46.7/MBsFile 3 - 302 seconds - 13,967,991,165 bytes ~46.2/MBsFile 4 - 94 seconds - 4,526,005,392 bytes ~48.1/MBsFile 5 - 113 seconds - 5,139,777,083 bytes ~45.4/MBsFile 6 - 107 seconds - 4,917,953,848 bytes ~45.9/MBs    As first it seemed like the culprit was the HDDs so I installed a Samsung EVO 850. It scored 226/MBs with the same read test so much faster than the HDDs. I then had it write a 34GB file to tape and it took 528 seconds (not including tape rewind time) coming in at ~69.1/MBs which is still slow so I don't think the bottle neck is the SATA drives. The FC card is showing the link speed as 8Gbps and even if it was 1Gbps it's still too slow so I don't think it could be that. All that's left is the tape drive or Debian/drivers/software. I'm using "tar cvf /dev/st0" to write data to the tape.  EDIT 22/05/24    I've since built a new computer with more modern hardware to see if it made a difference using a 5280K, 16GB RAM and GA-X99M-Gaming5. Tested with a 2TB HDD and RAM drive, both scored ~106/MBs which seems to be the maximum it can do. I don't know what speeds are good for LTO-5 and if you can realistically get anywhere close to maximum of 140/MBs.</Content></post><post><Title>backup multiple windows and Linux machines, and several loose HDD/SSD/CD/DVD onto a single windows machine (not NAS, not cloud)</Title><Author>u/tater1337</Author><Content>Honestly I tried searching here, but either I get confused or I cannot tell is the solution will fit my needs      I have[windows]my main PCwork laptopa second home machine that does some tasks that I don't want on the main PC (like housing all the backups)personal laptopa bunch of loose hard drives, both SSD and HDD with data that I might want in the future(grandparents disks full of photos type stuff)a PC set up as a DVR for a bunch of security cameras(not wanting to save the footage, just an easy restore if something breaks and a reinstall is needed)      Linuxa couple of PCs used for Minecraft serversa PC set up for home assistanta couple of netbooks, some have software for 3d printers, CNC machines, Laser engravers, etca whole load of raspberry pi's with various weird stuff      a stack of DVDs and CDs that I'd like to have backup copied in case of physical damage      right now I have some backups of some machines, but I have not been able to get everything backed up      my plantake my recently purchased 16tb drive and dump everything on that, then get another drive to copy the first (or expand)....THEN set up a backup physically somewhere else      what are my options?

For reference, I've bought two Seagate Barracuda Green 4TB, and I've sent them 3 times already to be replaced...      At the moment I have 1,3TB of photos and videos in a WD Blue 4TB, and I edit photos and videos with it.      Therefore, I'm thinking of buying a SSD to backup my media, since I haven't had any problems with them (granted, I've only used them as main drives).      Is the Crucial X6 (119 € 2TB) a good choice? It's on sale right now, but I've read that the cache depletes after having had 250GB written. After that, it writes at 40MBps, if I'm not mistaken. It is also QLC, which might affect longevity.      Regarding the X9 (144€ 2TB), I can't find any review...      I have bought the X9 pro (174€ 2TB) for my work, and it's very good, but it might be overkill for backups.

Hi,      I am using NTFS on Windows to run an research but i'm facing performance decrease, maybe due to data and index fragmentation.

Basically, I currently have an  Apple 2021 M1 iMac with 1 TB of storage, and I would like to backup my data. I can buy a $65 2 TB Seagate HDD, a $20 enclosure, use time machine to backup my data, and this would be a good solution (right? I’m saying these things as I understand them, but please correct anything I say that’s not entirely accurate). However, I have an old 1 TB HDD from an old iMac, because I swapped the HDD for an SSD. I think it might be convenient to use this for my backups instead. However, I’m like 90% I need to wipe and reformat the drive first, because when I just plug it in, it doesn’t show up on Time Machine. I’ve looked at the drive, and it seems like pretty much all of the data on it is on my current computer. However, I don’t want to lose any files that might only be on the HDD, and while I’m like 90% certain that all the data on the HDD is also on my iMac, I’d like to make certain before wiping it. So, two questions here:      What is the easiest way to check and see if all the data on the HDD is also on the SSD?      Do I even need to do that? Should I just bite the bullet and get a new 2 TB HDD? The HDD doesn’t support SMART so I can’t see exactly how many total read/writes are on it, but I’m fairly certain it really isn’t that many, so that isn’t a big concern of mine. Newer drives like the ones I was looking at from Seagate support SMART, so I guess that might be better for monitoring the drive’s health. Also, I’m only using about 250 GB on my SSD right now, the 1 TB HDD is large enough for backups.

My OneDrive Edu account, which was my digital haven with 5TB of space, has been abruptly downsized to a mere 100GB. This change came without warning, as I missed the memo about Microsoft scaling down storage for educational institutions.      Here’s my current setup:      Three 3.5 inch 1TB HDDs (one’s a dedicated movie library)      A 500GB Samsung 860 Evo SSD      A “2.5 / 3.5 inch 2 Bay USB3.0 1 to 1 Clone Hard Drive Dock” (sans RAID, so it’s just two separate drives)      With my OneDrive now bursting at the seams with 1.3TB-1.5TB of data, I’m exploring storage alternatives that won’t break the bank. The NAS Synology DS220j or DS223j are within my financial reach, but they offer only two hard drive slots.      There’s also an old family computer gathering dust back home, powered by an i5 (6th or 8th gen) and a 300W power supply of dubious origin. It’s been out of action for a while, and I’m not even sure it’s still operational. Reviving it would mean having it shipped over, which is a 4-5 day wait.      So, dear Redditors, what’s my best move here? Should I invest in a budget NAS, attempt to resurrect the old PC, or is there another ingenious solution I haven’t considered?      UPDATE:Thanks for everyone's comments, after a week has passed I update the current situation as follows.  Temporarily: I have manually backed up all data on OneDrive to 2 1TB hard drives. My data is temporarily safe.  Future: Maybe I will find a way to take advantage of the old computer at home to use up the remaining hard drives and have access to the data in the other two hard drives at all times. If that doesn't work, I'm thinking of buying Synology's DS423 NAS device.      The best-case scenario is that I could have 2 separate devices (1 Synology NAS and 1 NAS from my old computer), put them in 2 separate places and hope to find a way to sync them. In the long run, I will look into some more cloud storage packages to back up data from the other 2 devices. So I can have 3 copies of data: 1 on my personal computer that can be accessed at all times, 1 on the NAS device and 1 on the cloud. Hopefully this way I won't have to worry about data being at risk of being lost in the future.      UPDATE 2:      I was wondering why everyone suggested a 6TB hard drive to me so much. Then I realized that my poor English writing made people misunderstand that I needed to back up 5TB of data from OneDrive instead of 1.5TB.</Content></post><post><Title>Trust me, I'm not always this trashy 😁</Title><Author>u/zaca21</Author><Content>No content</Content></post><post><Title>Seeking Advice on Optimizing my Storage Configuration in Proxmox with TrueNAS Scale and ZFS</Title><Author>u/Vegan_Salad69</Author><Content>Hi everyone,      I’ve been homelabbing for about three years now and I’m looking for some advice on optimizing my storage setup. Here’s a quick overview of my current configuration:  Server: Dell R750  Front: Twelve 3.5" SATA/SAS bays  Rear: Four 2.5" SATA/SAS bays  RAID Card: PERC 350H (supports RAID 1, 0, 10) (don’t worry, I use it in passthrough mode and it works so far, even on ZFS. Yes, I know that’s also a problem, and I plan to buy an HBA or use the RAID card for its intended purpose)  4x 10Gig SFP+ Networking via DAC SFP+ Moduels (For more info on that i have a post of my entire homelab on my Profile)  Drives:    Eight 4TB HDDs      Two 3TB HDDs      Two 2TB HDDs      Two SAS 600GB HDDs      Two 2TB SATA SSDs  Current Setup:    Proxmox as the hypervisor      TrueNAS Scale as a VM with passthrough for ZFS      I’m facing potential performance issues because TrueNAS Scale is virtualized. I’m considering a few options and would love your input:  Installing Proxmox on SSDs: Utilizing the SSDs for the OS to leverage their speed for the hypervisor.  Using SAS drives as cache: Taking advantage of the 12Gbps speed for caching to enhance overall performance.  Direct ZFS on Proxmox: Managing the drives directly in Proxmox with ZFS, but I’m concerned about losing functionalities like SMB sharing, permissions management, and user administration.  I also have an old Synology RS2818RP+ that I could use:    Synology NAS with 16 bays and 10GbE connectivity.      Equipped with the E10M20-T1 (a 10Gig Network card with 2x 2TB NVMe SSDs for network cache).      Considering moving all large HDDs to the Synology and using it as the main storage, and only hosting the VMs' main system on the Dell's SSDs (so each VM gets 32GB; the main storage is on the Synology).      Direct 10GbE connection to the Dell R750 for high-speed access. (Block Access)  Potential Solutions:Bare Metal TrueNAS Scale: Install TrueNAS directly on the server for maximum performance, but lose the flexibility of Proxmox.  Proxmox with ZFS and Containers/VMs: Use Proxmox with ZFS for storage and handle additional services (SMB, permissions, Nextcloud) via LXC containers or VMs.  Hybrid Approach: Keep Proxmox with ZFS pools, and run a VM for TrueNAS Scale to manage SMB and NFS, with other services running in containers/VMs on Proxmox.  Leveraging Synology NAS:    Use the Synology as the main storage system with 10GbE connectivity to the Dell R750.      Utilize the NVMe SSD cache on the Synology for improved performance.      Keep the SSDs and SAS drives in the Dell R750 for caching and high-speed storage needs.      I’d love to hear your thoughts on these approaches or any other suggestions you might have. What would be the best way to balance performance, flexibility, and power efficiency in this setup?      Thanks in advance for your help! I hope you all have a good weekend.

However I remembered I pulled a few SAS HBA's out of it when I got it. They are Dell g164p 6GB/S HBA cards, apparently they are the same board as the more common H200E just with no internal headers, just external.      I'm thinking I can use these instead of purchasing another card, but unsure how I would hook this up, as far as I can deduce I'll need to plug in a backplane somewhere in the rear for the SATA board and I'll have to route the cables from outside the chassis. The g164p cards have a type of sfp connector, assuming this is standard for connecting backplanes etc and buying a backplane off of eBay for R720XD will work with this?      Related question, I would assume it's not possible to split the front drive bays so some are served with different controllers? If not then I'd have to mount new drives for the HBA controller in the rear somewhere, there does look established slots there already, 2.5".</Content></post><post><Title>Advice on building a DAS</Title><Author>u/the_mcm</Author><Content>I’m about to head off to college and want to have a single place for storage with some redundancy. I know it’d be best to have some sort of offisite backup, but I don’t really have the money for that right now judging by the amount of files I need to store.      I’d mostly be storing a lot of video projects (abt 6tb+ currently), hoping to also do some editing off of the DAS, along with playing and storing a decent bit of dvd/blu ray rips (abt 2+ tb and growing). I’d also probably have a decent but more of other miscellaneous music, videos, etc to store.      Doing some limited research I saw good things about the OWC Mercury quad paired with OWC’s SoftRaid to do a RAID5 set up.      Pricing things out, it seems like I could get 4 WD Red 8tb HDDs along with the OWC enclosure for right around my budget of about $1k, and would give me 24tb usable space.      Does this seem like a reasonable set up for my needs, and would RAID5 be good if I’ll be writing and reading from the DAS often? Thanks.</Content></post><post><Title>Will storing large files in a NAS wear out hard drives faster?</Title><Author>u/Hostile_18</Author><Content>Hi all. New to all this. Got my media NAS and am trying to decide between good x254 encodes at around 1.2-2.2gb or full 1080p remux episodes at around 7-12gb. My question is will the quality difference be worth it, and also will it significantly reduce the hard drives lifespan? I've got 6x 20tb Exos drives that have a work load of 550tb a year for 5 years, I guess half that if you run parity once a month. All this and that's not even counting huge 4k remux files. The X-files 1080p remux from the Blu-Ray discs is like 2tb alone.      What's anyone elses experience hosting large media files? Have the hard drives held up over time?

I want to consolidate decades of data from different sources and put it all together on a DAS (or similar) that can plug into a 2018 MacBook Pro (with USB-C).      I’m going with DAS-to-computer setup because I intend to use Backblaze to keep the whole thing backed up to the cloud for low-cost (directly connected drives are included in their unlimited backup and only need to be plugged in once a year to stay backed up).      Ideally, I’d like around 10 TB, but I’m unsure how to get there.      I was hoping to use SSD drives or M.2 in some kind of enclosure but they may be too expensive. It sounds like software RAID is better, but I’m unsure how to get that going on a Mac, and I’m not sure which enclosure/drives to get.      Oh yes, and the main consideration is cost - I need to do this on the cheap, even if it's a little improvised or rough around the edges.      I don’t need screaming speed, but I do want to move and access many photos and videos without having to wait.      If 2 or 3 large and slow SATA drives on a particular RAID setup gets me good enough performance through USB-3 or Thunderbolt, that’s also fine.      There are so many options, and I’m a little bamboozled.      So in summary:      looking for hardware and Mac RAID suggestions      DAS connected to a Mac with USB-C      Around 10 TB      Fast transfer, but not too expensive      Happy to build and find parts      Any thoughts?</Content></post><post><Title>efficient and visually pleasing way to combine all the images I downloaded from a Pinterest board?</Title><Author>u/Late_Repair_9899</Author><Content>Firstly, I have found my home.

I'm going to be scanning some prints, I don't need to worry about film. I come from a normal family of illiterates that throw the negatives out when the prints are made. I'm not that close with my family and I'm not going to be inheriting most of these pictures so it is likely I wont easily ever have a chance to see these pictures again when my grandmother is gone.      So while I have the chance I want to do this right and max out the quality of the scans I'm going to get. I've tried to figure this out by myself but it would be nice to get some other opinions. It seems like the Epson v600 might be good enough that it can capture more than enough data than prints can give. The v850 seems have slightly deeper resolution for shades of dark. A decent amount of the pictures will be black and white.      Are there any other options I'm missing? It seems a bit strange that a 15 year old scanner would be the best option on the market. Does the 850 produce tangibly better results? Because of the context I want to do this as best I can now. Lastly what resolution should I aim for to have master scans?

My aunt passed away last Friday. I'm at her visitation right now. My sisters and my other aunt put together a few photo boards of my aunt. And seeing all of the photos reminds me that I seriously need to learn how to protect my family photos, videos, family history, my own personal files, etc. I know that I need to make multiple copies and use multiple ways of store things,  hard drives, cloud storage, external hard drives. Apart from that I know absolutely nothing about computers, I don't even have a computer. Currently I have things stored on a few thumb drives and I know I shouldn't rely on those for storage. Please help.      Update: I want to thank everyone for their advice and suggestions. I'm sorry that I haven't replied to everyone's comments. Life is bit hectic at the moment. When I get some free time I'll be able to read and process everyone's comments.

Wanting to get a 5th, but realizing that this probably isn't an ideal solution for heat or longevity of the drives.      Currently, everything is going into a powered USB hub and connecting to my laptop. Was wondering what solutions are available that are worth looking into, that offer the best value for the price. NAS? A USB hard drive bay? Or, would buying a couple extra externals really not be a problem? I'll probably only buy 2 more drives before building a desktop that could hold a lot of the drives internally anyway.</Content></post><post><Title>I can't mount this partition, I might have encrypted it via VeraCrypt but it's not taking my usual passwords.

The collection contains all the different versions of each game for each platform, plus it has the registered (complete) version of the games Super Angelo and Super Worms for DOS and a modded full version of Charlie the Duck for android.      Since most of the games are shareware (demo), I think most people like me could only play the demo version of Super Angelo, limited to 3 levels only, since the shareware version is the easiest to find. The complete version has way more levels and the final ending. The Flash version of Super Angelo is also complete. Some of the games can't be be purchased anymore and remain in their demo version like Olaf &amp;amp; Elmar In the Castle of Nabokos.      Some of the games include their user's manual, level maps (Super Worms) or source code (Mario &amp;amp; Luigi and Mario!!!).

I only use them for backup purposes, so phone pictures, game screenshots, some files, etc, which I manually copy across to two drives (muh redundancy). Lots of small files basically. My dutiful 2TB drive's recently gotten the dreaded red line of "your space's running out", and I saw a good deal on an 8TB 3.5" external so jumped on it. However, it comes pre-formatted exFAT, which I'm aware isn't as well regarded as NTFS. I've only ever seen them on flashdrives myself. It's also an SMR drive (spooky, I know), so I'm not sure if NTFS or exFAT makes a difference there.      Basically my question is, is it really worth while re-formatting to NTFS, or can I just keep it exFAT? This is going to be the backup drive of my backup drive, but I'd still rather it not get corrupted or have any other issues down the line. I'd also rather not unnecessarily spend time re-formatting it if there's not much reason to. I mean, I figure it should be fine since that's how it came out the box, but better safe than sorry. It's one of those newer-era Seagate Expansions with the diagonal lines, if that makes any difference.      And lastly, if I do go the route of re-formatting, would a quick format be fine given it's never been used for anything? And any guidelines for allocation unit size, being an SMR drive (is smaller/larger size better)?      Thanks all!</Content></post><post><Title>Will they ever change the sizing descriptions to actual space available?</Title><Author>u/Strange_Advisor_</Author><Content>I understand the gap with you buy a 10TB hard drive you get 9TB of actual usable space, but with the growth in the size of hard drives the gap is getting more and more.

During this time, I would like to turn off everything in our household, as electricity prices in my country (Germany) are very high. Dev-Servers, APs, FW, etc. should not be a problem, but I have some concerns about my two NAS devices. NAS1 (Synology) with 2x4TB has been running continuously for 5.8 years without any issues, while NAS2 (QNAP) 2x12TB has been running for about 9 months.      What is the life expectancy of the HDDs, especially for NAS1, if the HDDs have been running for almost 6 years and will now be off for about 10 weeks? I’m not concerned about data security; all data is backed up multiple times.

So I recently got into data hoarding. It first started with a Plex server, then i archived ALL of my photos. When I was showing my archived photos to my family in the Synology photos app, my grandma asked if I could digitize her thousands upon thousands of photos. Then she spread the word to her emblem club and elks lodge friends that I was doing it for her and now a half dozen of her friends want me to do theirs too. They offered to pay me for the service.      I was looking at scanners, and it seems like consumer grade scanners are a hit and miss. They are either too slow, or the ones that are fast leave marks on the originals. I tried looking up commercial grade scanners but I'm not able to find anything. I'm sure they're expensive, but I've been wanting to start a side business for my wife, so that she can quit her current job and be at home with the kids more. So I'm willing to invest in a good quality machine if the market is there.</Content></post><post><Title>Storage Spaces + SSD array + cache drive?</Title><Author>u/olo99</Author><Content>Building a new rig that among other things will be used for storage as well.Plan is to get a 9500-16i HBA card (IT-mode) and connecting 6 x SSD (SATA 2.5") to it.      I have previously only used hardware RAID but this time I want to give Windows and StorageSpaces a shot. The storage is mainly an initial backup (also have cloud and offline) + all movies/shows for Plex Media Server.      First question. Is Windows Storage Spaces a good choice for software raid? From what I understand configuration through powershell is a must and then parity can be set up to mimic RAID 5 or 6?      I am using WD RED SSD. These do not have PLP unfortunately (dont have the money do buy enterprise drives with PLP).  Would there be any benefit of adding a NVME SSD with PLP to use as a cache drive for the pool?  I am not really clear on whether having a PLP capable drive as cache write would be enough to protect the whole array if there's an unexpected outage?      If cache drive, I read somewhere that two drives are needed for this in WSS? Is this true?If the cache drive with PLP wouldn't protect the whole array, is there any point at all of using additional cache drive for a SSD array?      Should I look elsewhere for some other RAID/parity solution? I need Windows 11 to be used on the rig so ZFS is not an option for example.    Other recommendations have been drivepool and snapraid. I want this running on windows 11 that's the only dealbreaker, apart from that I am open to any suggestion :)      Really appreciate any advice and insight!</Content></post><post><Title>ISO extra to MKV/ MP4 ?</Title><Author>u/positivename</Author><Content>So depsite my best efforts to get my kid to put dvds away ...well many of you already know.

Given that I'm in the process of hoarding historical familial information, which is 100% media (documents, scans, videos, pictures etc) I'm naturally wondering if a conventional 'plug-into-your-tv' bluray player would support the bdxl medium. Naturally, it would have to have all the codecs for the storage to work. The merits of being able to make an mdisk full of family history for sharing purposes could be ideal if it's the case &amp;amp; the potential of storing it in a fireproof safe with a portable bluray player is pretty tempting too.      It's a stupidly simple question, and probably innately obvious but I can't find anything concrete anywhere.

I don't mind getting another dedicated drive - but I'm trying to see what kinds of file systems and organization might be better.I'm trying to avoid having to create the same file structure on the second drive to organize new media.      Ideally, I'm trying to understand if there's a solution that I can use to create an organization that is expandable, meaning that I can just create folders, and if I need more space, I can just add more storage drives. Is this like a RAID system?      i'm pretty rookie when it comes to advanced storage options so I appreciate any help!</Content></post><post><Title>SSD in Sabrent enclosure is plugged into an ALWAYS ON USB 2.0 port on Micca Speck G2 TV box, is this possibly decreasing the life of the sata SSD compared to if the USB powered off when the box is off?</Title><Author>u/Bern_Down_the_DNC</Author><Content>Just making sure that theTeamgroup EX2 sata SSD is going to sleep, either because of it's own firmware or because of the enclosure when the TV box is off but USB port is still powered on.

As a result, I looked into RAID 0 to boost performance, but I don't want to be SOL if one of my drives fail.  I don't have the money to be purchasing more 8TB drives, so my thought is to use two 1TB HDDs for a RAID 0 array to be used while I'm editing, then use the 8TB HDD for backups.      Any thoughts on this?  Any good way to ensure my data is being backed up onto the 8TB drive as new data is written to the RAID 0 Array?      Also, if it matters, I'm on a Win 11 PC.

Worse, they continue to charge for the old storage space.      I've had a Google Workspace account for 8 years. Despite paying for cloud storage, Google is now refusing to provide the service. A supervisor admitted on a recorded call that they will not honor the storage plan I paid for over the past 8 years, even though they still charge me. This is blatant fraud, and Google seems to think they're above the law.      They stripped me of my storage and demanded I pay a 500% price increase plus a fee per user. If I don't comply, they'll delete all my 1TB of data and close my account. This new policy and contract were never agreed upon by me, despite my 8-year loyalty.      This is how mega-corporations treat consumers, and the government does nothing to stop them. Google is committing fraud on a massive scale, as admitted by their supervisor.      I've decided to go public, sell all my Google shares, and urge others to dump Google stock. Let's see how they react to a boycott.

I ran sudo hdparm -B /dev/sda    And the hard drive says I have no APM support for spindown.      I've asked in the Odroid forum about how to spindown hard drives "properly" they suggested using hd-idle.      But that opens the question if I should even be spinning down the hard drives?      This Odroid will be my offsite backup, plus my Nextcloud server. Backups to and from the hard drive will run every day and of course random nextcloud access, whenever I need something from the "cloud".      I have two other 4 bay NAS's one the primary server for "videos" while the other is my backup of "videos" plus backup of my computer data.      The video NAS is accessed say a couple times a day and my local backup server is backed up daily      So I have say 9 drives all Western Digital Reds NAS drives.      What is the consensus here about spinning down the drives? Should I bother or just leave them as they are? What are the pros and cons?      Thanks for any help you can give.      I did search for spindown but didn't find much.</Content></post><post><Title>I cannot connect to my NAS from Windows, but I can from everything else.

I assume most here are of the same mindset as me, though maybe more dedicated. After being thoroughly confused by the wiki, and combing through old posts, I thought I should just ask a few questions.      I don't really need help with the actual copying part, there are plenty of guides out there (makeMKV seems to be the best suggestion for DVDs in this sub, according the wiki). I have also looked around for the actual storage device. I don't have enough data to be worth getting a server rack, and the more "manual" forms seem slow  (like mdisc) since I plan to tap into these fairly often. What I will end up doing is probably having a couple USB drives, each with a copy of my "cache" of stuff, be it photos or movies or games or whatnot. Probably every 5 years I will just copy everything over to a new drive, to counteract any kind of physical deterioration with the drive (my research seems to point that they are finnicky when it comes to how long they can last). These caches will be large enough to not be worth combing through every time I copy stuff to check it works. At the time that I transfer the data, is there any kind of non-invasive software I can run the files through to make sure they are still readable? Because I don't want to go to look at a photo and see that 10 years ago it got corrupted and is gone.      TL;DR      I want to keep my stuff on USB drives to access often, but replace every 5 years.

HELP ME PLS</Title><Author>u/husker3in4</Author><Content>Hey all, I need a storage solution, I have external drives for my data overload, but I want something always on and always connected to my computer. I don't quite understand how a NAS works or all the cool things it can do, but what I do like, from what I'm reading, is that the NAS can provide parity protection if I choose SHR during setup, right? I will use 4 disks, in one of the 4 bay NAS from Synology.      The other thing: I want the NAS to show up in my File Explorer (Windows 10), like the whole NAS. I keep seeing people talk about their home folder, and that you can map your home folder to your File Explorer, but I want to see the whole NAS on my File Explorer, so I can click it like another drive, and drag and drop files to the main NAS or into my home folder.      BTW, this is strictly for home use, just myself on it. Given that knowledge, what is the difference between putting folders on the main directory of the NAS vs into my home folder? Is there some security or performance advantage or disadvantage to one or the other? I think I understand the purpose of the home folder, is to keep several users files separated and private from each other, but again, it will just be me on the NAS.I had my son set up Plex on my PC, and I am reading this is something that can run on the NAS as well, so I might do that too if I can figure it out. Other than that, I just need to transfer files back and forth to the NAS via File Explorer, sometimes files that are 10 or 20gb in size. I admit I'm a data hoarder so if this NAS can work in this way, I'd likely set up different folders for all of my data overflow that won't fit on my computer's internal drives.      I understand how Windows 10 works as a home user but again, I'm a complete newbie to networking and NAS, and get confused pretty quickly when I start reading about all the advanced options and even get lost watching videos about all the seemingly millions of settings, security etc.Who do you recommend for YT videos explaining how it works, easy way to set it up and run for home use, single user etc? I looked at the Space Rex guy already. I don't know if It's how he presents the information or what but I can't follow him very well.The one thing I got from SpaceRex is that is he way smarter than I am, and he offers a service to set it up but for $300 an hour! If I were to find someone who could do it for a much more reasonable price, is that wise, or am I asking for trouble?The movie War Games from the 80s keeps flashing thru my mind, when they find the original programmer who snuck in thru a "backdoor" left in the system in case he needed to get back in....</Content></post><post><Title>Book Scanning: A guide about light?</Title><Author>u/DontAskForTheMoon</Author><Content>Hi. Imagine a very simple set up, a book opened 180° on a table and being scanned by a phone from above, also 180° (usually just the necessary pages and not the whole book, but they can be still like 100+ pages at times). No extra programs, just normal photos.      I recently struggle heavily with especially modern scientific books. Their paper is not made of trees anymore, but they feel like thin plastic - the same material as most magazines are made of.      Those magazine-like pages have a heavily disgusting light reflection potential. How exactly could I configure the light (like angle and its strength) to reduce those reflections? (Post-processing to black and white isn't possible, since those books contain coloured images, so I want to keep the original colours as they are)      I already looked for setups, most of them are very professional and they have professional cameras etc. They also just use light on each page with desk-lamps. But it never looked like they are using special lens filters.      If there is no way to reduce reflection with basic methods (like angle and strength of light, or phone camera settings), then my last option would be Polarizing Gel. But if there were solutions without extra costs, I would prefer them.</Content></post><post><Title>Size of SLC dynamic cache as for Samsung 980 Pro</Title><Author>u/Biyeuy</Author><Content>Have seen one opinion that Samsung 980 SSD has dynamic SLC whose size reaches high percentage of drive storage capacity.

On my way to 3-2-1 I decided to improve that by having a local clone of it (another cloud backup once I decide which one you buy), and I have questions on how to do that safely and efficiently. Most Google searches give me cloud offerings or full OS backup with lots of tinkering.      I have around 250gb of data collected over several years, so I don't expect it to grow super fast, and it's only me adding pictures every other week or so. I bought a 1tb external disk to do the backups. My local disk do not have all of the data, the only place that have it in its entirety is pCloud.      I use Ubuntu and I'm not a guru, so I'm looking for a solution that is reasonably easy, to avoid having a backup that I couldn't figure out how to restore. And for now I intend to backup myself every month or so, then later I can add a cron job or something.      First, to take the data out of pCloud I tested rclone and it seemed to work great. I can do a sync with it to add and eventually remove pictures I excluded from pCloud, maybe use interactive mode to ensure nothing is being inadvertently deleted (at least while I use it interactive mode). Suggestions on this?      Second and my greatest doubt, how to store it in the disk? I'd like something with incremental backups, and that ideally adds some layer of protection against disk degradation, data corruption and such. I came across BTRFS and it sounded like a natural fit. I can format the disk with it, then do  periodic snapshots, then maybe a full backup every once in a while. Any good suggestion on how to do that, filesystem flags to enable, something instead of BTRFS, etc? Also, what's a good way to know that the backups are working properly?</Content></post><post><Title>I can't download from Mediafire with JDownloader</Title><Author>u/RayquazaAndDeoxysFan</Author><Content>Help, I can't seem to download the folder with JDownloader, whenever I add the link I get this file "Content offline!shared" what should I do?

This drive had been unaccessed for a few years; a few months ago, I put about 500GB onto the drive and there were no issues. However, now as I'm trying to manually clone the drive to create a duplicate, the drive is having issues. Read times are slow and Task Manager says the drive is constantly being written to; my PC always detects the drive when I plug it in, but it sometimes times out before I can actually open the drive. At other times, I can access the drive and it will copy files over, but slowly. As well, if the drive is plugged in when I try to turn off the computer, the PC will stall before turning off and I've had to manually press the power button to shut it off. Finally, I've seen the following errors pop up as I've tried to access the drive/copy files:      Location Not Available - Data Error (cyclic redundancy check)      Drive is not accessible - The parameter is incorrect      Error 0x80070079 - The Semaphore Timeout period has expired      Can't read from the source file or disk  Attempted troubleshooting:    I tried running CHKDSK but it also wouldn't run (which, as I've done more research, seems like the wrong solution). No physical issues that I can detect (just a normal hum, no clicks or anything), and changing cables doesn't help. Lastly, it seems like if I let the drive rest for a few days, the drive runs closer to normal.      Can anyone provide insight into what's going on, and/or provide a solution? Most of the drive I believe is already duplicated in other locations, but unfortunately there's about 100GB that's probably not backed up anywhere else.

The drive can come loose inside if you move it in/out of a storage box, they can overheat badly if the fan stops working, etc.      (https://www.reddit.com/r/DataHoarder/comments/1cq41rj/ive_had_it_with_individual_external_enclosures/)I wanted to use sata to usb adapters with an open frame because it would be easier to add drives (while enclosures have a max number of slots and you have to buy a larger enclosure if you need more).      This was met with people saying that is the worst way to do it and that they have a high chance of errors, random disconnects, and shared bandwith. And instead I should get a 4 slot enclosure. But I've read the reviews on the models that people suggested.... and they all seem to have those same problems.      Here is a thread from 3 years ago where people are talking about multi-slot enclosures corrupting drives. (https://www.reddit.com/r/DataHoarder/comments/oty6em/any_recommendations_for_a_simple_nonraid_4_bay_35/)      A couple comments did mention that esata seems to be more reliable than usb. But I wanted to get more opinions - can usb multi-slot enclosures be reliable? I don't want to do raid. I just want to sync the same files across 2 drives for media library, and 2 more drives for personal files. I will just be tranferring 10 gigs or so per month to one drive, then copying to the twin, then verifying the data.      Should I give up on enclosures? Or do I just need to buy a good usb cable to prevent random disconnects? If enclosures can't be reliable for important data, should I set up a server and then transfer over the local network? I'm open to esata  but I only have a regular sata port on the motherboard, so I would need a pcie adapter.

What I will end up doing is probably having a couple USB drives, each with a copy of my "cache" of stuff, be it photos or movies or games or whatnot. Probably every 5 years I will just copy everything over to a new drive, to counteract any kind of physical deterioration with the drive (my research seems to point that they are finnicky when it comes to how long they can last). These caches will be large enough to not be worth combing through every time I copy stuff to check it works. At the time that I transfer the data, is there any kind of non-invasive software I can run the files through to make sure they are still readable? Because I don't want to go to look at a photo and see that 10 years ago it got corrupted and is gone.      TL;DR      I want to keep my stuff on USB drives to access often, but replace every 5 years. What can I do to ensure I don't lose whatever is on the drives? Or are there better options for this scenario than a flash drive?      (Thank you for your help, but please keep terminology and such on a low level, I am not my grandfather, but I am not super well versed with this kind of stuff)</Content></post><post><Title>Can't find VideoID for BrightCove player video</Title><Author>u/Karlox2</Author><Content>I'm trying to download the video embeded in this page: https://video.repubblica.it/spettacoli-e-cultura/angelina-mango-e-l-urlo-liberatorio-alla-finale-dell-eurovison-il-video-dal-backstage/469184/470138    I followed the URL template method but with no luck since I couldn't find the video id when opening the brightcove player menu.

HELP ME PLS</Title><Author>u/husker3in4</Author><Content>Hey all, I need a storage solution, I have external drives for my data overload, but I want something always on and always connected to my computer. I don't quite understand how a NAS works or all the cool things it can do, but what I do like, from what I'm reading, is that the NAS can provide parity protection if I choose SHR during setup, right? I will use 4 disks, in one of the 4 bay NAS from Synology.      The other thing: I want the NAS to show up in my File Explorer (Windows 10), like the whole NAS. I keep seeing people talk about their home folder, and that you can map your home folder to your File Explorer, but I want to see the whole NAS on my File Explorer, so I can click it like another drive, and drag and drop files to the main NAS or into my home folder.      BTW, this is strictly for home use, just myself on it. Given that knowledge, what is the difference between putting folders on the main directory of the NAS vs into my home folder? Is there some security or performance advantage or disadvantage to one or the other? I think I understand the purpose of the home folder, is to keep several users files separated and private from each other, but again, it will just be me on the NAS.I had my son set up Plex on my PC, and I am reading this is something that can run on the NAS as well, so I might do that too if I can figure it out. Other than that, I just need to transfer files back and forth to the NAS via File Explorer, sometimes files that are 10 or 20gb in size. I admit I'm a data hoarder so if this NAS can work in this way, I'd likely set up different folders for all of my data overflow that won't fit on my computer's internal drives.      I understand how Windows 10 works as a home user but again, I'm a complete newbie to networking and NAS, and get confused pretty quickly when I start reading about all the advanced options and even get lost watching videos about all the seemingly millions of settings, security etc.Who do you recommend for YT videos explaining how it works, easy way to set it up and run for home use, single user etc? I looked at the Space Rex guy already. I don't know if It's how he presents the information or what but I can't follow him very well.The one thing I got from SpaceRex is that is he way smarter than I am, and he offers a service to set it up but for $300 an hour! If I were to find someone who could do it for a much more reasonable price, is that wise, or am I asking for trouble?The movie War Games from the 80s keeps flashing thru my mind, when they find the original programmer who snuck in thru a "backdoor" left in the system in case he needed to get back in....</Content></post><post><Title>Book Scanning: A guide about light?</Title><Author>u/DontAskForTheMoon</Author><Content>Hi. Imagine a very simple set up, a book opened 180° on a table and being scanned by a phone from above, also 180° (usually just the necessary pages and not the whole book, but they can be still like 100+ pages at times). No extra programs, just normal photos.      I recently struggle heavily with especially modern scientific books. Their paper is not made of trees anymore, but they feel like thin plastic - the same material as most magazines are made of.      Those magazine-like pages have a heavily disgusting light reflection potential. How exactly could I configure the light (like angle and its strength) to reduce those reflections? (Post-processing to black and white isn't possible, since those books contain coloured images, so I want to keep the original colours as they are)      I already looked for setups, most of them are very professional and they have professional cameras etc. They also just use light on each page with desk-lamps. But it never looked like they are using special lens filters.      If there is no way to reduce reflection with basic methods (like angle and strength of light, or phone camera settings), then my last option would be Polarizing Gel. But if there were solutions without extra costs, I would prefer them.</Content></post><post><Title>Size of SLC dynamic cache as for Samsung 980 Pro</Title><Author>u/Biyeuy</Author><Content>Have seen one opinion that Samsung 980 SSD has dynamic SLC whose size reaches high percentage of drive storage capacity.

Now my drive is failing and I've bought a new one to replace it.      The old drive was formatted in NTFS for use with both Linux (Mint) and Windows, while the new one (also 3 TB) will probably be formatted in BTRFS (there's an unofficial driver for Win10-11). I'd like to copy the data as-is - including meta-data - from the old drive to the new one.      Can I even use Clonezilla if the filesystem is different on source and destination partitions?

On my way to 3-2-1 I decided to improve that by having a local clone of it (another cloud backup once I decide which one you buy), and I have questions on how to do that safely and efficiently. Most Google searches give me cloud offerings or full OS backup with lots of tinkering.      I have around 250gb of data collected over several years, so I don't expect it to grow super fast, and it's only me adding pictures every other week or so. I bought a 1tb external disk to do the backups. My local disk do not have all of the data, the only place that have it in its entirety is pCloud.      I use Ubuntu and I'm not a guru, so I'm looking for a solution that is reasonably easy, to avoid having a backup that I couldn't figure out how to restore. And for now I intend to backup myself every month or so, then later I can add a cron job or something.      First, to take the data out of pCloud I tested rclone and it seemed to work great. I can do a sync with it to add and eventually remove pictures I excluded from pCloud, maybe use interactive mode to ensure nothing is being inadvertently deleted (at least while I use it interactive mode). Suggestions on this?      Second and my greatest doubt, how to store it in the disk? I'd like something with incremental backups, and that ideally adds some layer of protection against disk degradation, data corruption and such. I came across BTRFS and it sounded like a natural fit. I can format the disk with it, then do  periodic snapshots, then maybe a full backup every once in a while. Any good suggestion on how to do that, filesystem flags to enable, something instead of BTRFS, etc? Also, what's a good way to know that the backups are working properly?</Content></post><post><Title>I can't download from Mediafire with JDownloader</Title><Author>u/RayquazaAndDeoxysFan</Author><Content>Help, I can't seem to download the folder with JDownloader, whenever I add the link I get this file "Content offline!shared" what should I do?

This drive had been unaccessed for a few years; a few months ago, I put about 500GB onto the drive and there were no issues. However, now as I'm trying to manually clone the drive to create a duplicate, the drive is having issues. Read times are slow and Task Manager says the drive is constantly being written to; my PC always detects the drive when I plug it in, but it sometimes times out before I can actually open the drive. At other times, I can access the drive and it will copy files over, but slowly. As well, if the drive is plugged in when I try to turn off the computer, the PC will stall before turning off and I've had to manually press the power button to shut it off. Finally, I've seen the following errors pop up as I've tried to access the drive/copy files:      Location Not Available - Data Error (cyclic redundancy check)      Drive is not accessible - The parameter is incorrect      Error 0x80070079 - The Semaphore Timeout period has expired      Can't read from the source file or disk  Attempted troubleshooting:    I tried running CHKDSK but it also wouldn't run (which, as I've done more research, seems like the wrong solution). No physical issues that I can detect (just a normal hum, no clicks or anything), and changing cables doesn't help. Lastly, it seems like if I let the drive rest for a few days, the drive runs closer to normal.      Can anyone provide insight into what's going on, and/or provide a solution? Most of the drive I believe is already duplicated in other locations, but unfortunately there's about 100GB that's probably not backed up anywhere else.

The drive can come loose inside if you move it in/out of a storage box, they can overheat badly if the fan stops working, etc.      (https://www.reddit.com/r/DataHoarder/comments/1cq41rj/ive_had_it_with_individual_external_enclosures/)I wanted to use sata to usb adapters with an open frame because it would be easier to add drives (while enclosures have a max number of slots and you have to buy a larger enclosure if you need more).      This was met with people saying that is the worst way to do it and that they have a high chance of errors, random disconnects, and shared bandwith. And instead I should get a 4 slot enclosure. But I've read the reviews on the models that people suggested.... and they all seem to have those same problems.      Here is a thread from 3 years ago where people are talking about multi-slot enclosures corrupting drives. (https://www.reddit.com/r/DataHoarder/comments/oty6em/any_recommendations_for_a_simple_nonraid_4_bay_35/)      A couple comments did mention that esata seems to be more reliable than usb. But I wanted to get more opinions - can usb multi-slot enclosures be reliable? I don't want to do raid. I just want to sync the same files across 2 drives for media library, and 2 more drives for personal files. I will just be tranferring 10 gigs or so per month to one drive, then copying to the twin, then verifying the data.      Should I give up on enclosures? Or do I just need to buy a good usb cable to prevent random disconnects? If enclosures can't be reliable for important data, should I set up a server and then transfer over the local network? I'm open to esata  but I only have a regular sata port on the motherboard, so I would need a pcie adapter.

I rushed to buy a new drive and landed on a 6TB WD drive [WD60EFPX], which I paid a decent penny for [pc parts are expensive here]. I managed to get most of the data out of the old drive into the new one, the old drive actually died at the tail end of the backup process, but ok, I still managed to get most of the data out.      Fast forward to last saturday, 2 months later. Something I left downloading overnight wasn't finished when I woke up and was giving a cycling redundancy error. I checked CrystalDiskInfo and there it was, Current Pending Sector count at 200.      Then I decided to order an external hard drive so that I could backup the most critical stuff and fully format the drive. A few hours before the external HDD gets here, the WD hard drive dies and my PC won't boot with it plugged, at all. It will show up in the bios, but that's about it.      I'm assuming it's over? Any chance at all that this could be something else? bad sata port? bad sata cable? Moody hard drive lol? I've already started the RMA procedure, just waiting to hear back from the company.      In hindsight I should have taken the 2 hour drive to buy the external drive in person. I live kind of remotely, anything PC related requires a trip. But I got lazy and that's what happens. This is the first time a piece of hardware just up and fails on me within 2 months of use. I guess it's bound to happen at some point.</Content></post><post><Title>Using HBA SAS card as SAS target?</Title><Author>u/fernandolcx</Author><Content>Sorry if this is a dumb question, but I was thinking about the meaning of "IT firmware" as "Initiator/Target" in storage terminology.

I had a Synology DS916+ (8GB), with 4 x 8 TB ironwolves in raid 5 (SHR). It died (won’t power on, power cable seems fine), and now I need a new NAS. I am also looking to optimise my small network to increase the usability of the NAS.I use two laptops ( Mac and Windows) and try to keep all my files on the NAS rather than on the devices. I fly drones and often have to transfer a few hundred gigabytes on and off the NAS for storage or editing videos. I have generally been disappointed with the transfer speeds of the old unit over Gbe.      I created a scuffed diagram of my network. I would love to make my own NAS and get homeassistant off the old laptop that runs it, but my apartment is small. I have been looking at the DS923+, DS1522+ and DS1621+. The latter has an extra bay, and two extra GbE ports.      Is upgrading any of these things going to help me with transfer speeds for my use cases:(Transferring large files, editing from the NAS, Steam remote play)      1 - Either NAS being much faster due to the processor.2 - Using link aggregation on the NAS, with a new compatible Gbe switch (and the benefits of 2 vs. 4 Gbe ports).3 - Using link aggregation on my laptops via 2x ethernet connections to the switch, with an extra Gbe dongle.3 - Buying a 2.5Gbe switch, (with link aggregation?).4 - Buying a 2.5Gbe USB C dongle ( and also potentially using link aggrigation).5 - Buying the (expensive) 10Gbe module for either DiskStation.6 - Adding different name drives to these more modern NAS.      I am willing to use a number of these solutions, such as buying a 2.5 switch and dongle, running 4xGbe link aggregation on the NAS, and using 2 cables from my laptop on a new switch.      I am unsure how effective any of this will be. If anyone can shed some light on this stuff, or give advice on these NAS, I would appreciate it.</Content></post><post><Title>Help us DataHoarder, you're our only hope...</Title><Author>u/CriticalMemory</Author><Content>Hey folks, thanks for reading.

They recommend for security reasons to use a different user in it's own group for each container.      The thing is shared folders are created as belonging to root/users, to which the container user has no permissions. Setting the user to have rw on the shared folders from OMV's web UI did nothing (not sure how it's suppose to since it's not owning or part of the owning group). The only way to fix this was to add the user to the shares' ACL. This just feels wrong, also that's not as described in the manual. Without the ACL, deluge is unaware of the permissions issue (since on the container side it's root), but nothing is downloaded or uploaded and trying to move storage location leads to errors.      Is the manual wrong or did I miss something?      Edit: Ps. with the ACL, downloaded files are created as owned by container-user / users, which is odd since the container user is not part of users, but at least that works for accessing via users' members.</Content></post><post><Title>Is there a 3.5 HDD case that turns off and on with the PC?</Title><Author>u/Automatic_Ad_621</Author><Content>As per the title, is there an external box for HDD 3.5 (2bay) that turns on and off together with the PC to which it is connected?</Content></post><post><Title>Best Sata expansion card at this time?</Title><Author>u/Heinosity11</Author><Content>Hey all,      So yea I did look first at some recent posts, but didnt find any super recent.

I am not very excited of the options out there, but maybe im not looking in the right place.

Looking for maybe a 6 port card, but could do with a 4...And yes I have a pcie 3x4 slot for the expansion card on my mobo that doesnt conflict bandwidth with other things. From amazon I found this one by "IO Crest" (tried to link the page, but i think my post got removed for that-sorry huge reddit noob). Seems better then most because it has a 4.4 star review and lots of reviews...Another question I have though is which chipset is the best/most reliable? Looking at just this sale page there are JMB, MV and ASM. Obviously there could be others I am unaware of. Price really isnt a huge concern in the sense that if I can get a super tried and true/industry standard one for a little more i definitely would be down to do that.

Let’s say I put 4 drives in it: when I plug it into a windows machine does it come up as 4 different drive letters?      This would be good because then if I’m doing a periodic manual backup I know how to put the data on separate drives.      Or when I plug it in do all 4 “combine” into one drive letter?

I've been running through posts here and having trouble identifying a simple solution for preserving data integrity on 1 or 2 5tb hard drives (both would have backups at a friend's house).      Are there ready-made solutions to just get raid and zfs (is zfs a form of raid or an additional process?) working for these drives without going through building a system out and learning commands?      More speficically delving into zfs(what I assume to be the preferred method of corruption protection) is coming up with a set of incomprehensible computer jargon that I'm having a difficult time wrapping my head around. Are the consumer oriented prebuilt raid setups using this by default? How difficult is getting zfs running on one of these for someone not proficient in coding or online command usage?</Content></post><post><Title>Bulk downloading archive.org URLs of a site?</Title><Author>u/AndrewTatesCumshot</Author><Content>Hi, there is this website on archive.org that I'm looking to download all of its files. The page where you get the calendar results and then go to URLs, where you get multiple pages of files listed which you can sort by date, search by type, etc, and you have to click each one of them, which would then lead you to the calendar page again and you have to seek a date that has a download link. This particular one has thousands and it would take forever.      Is there some kind of program or browser extension that could just grab all of the links and start downloading the files for me? I searched for such and found a post where somebody recommended JDownloader but I don't think it's meant for the job I'm looking to be done, or at least I have no idea how to use it for this particular purpose.

I currently have 5TB worth of data and have been using Robocopy every night to backup to a second drive.  I just bought 2x 18TB Western Digitals and am debating over using Robocopy again, or using Windows Raid 1 to mirror the drives.

I'm making and having to store about 40-50gb of footage per day for three and a half months. It is being edited into five segments of about equal length. Each segment will be edited in sequential order so footage stored will only need to be retrieved/stored every couple of months.

The source of trush Disk is now dead, and I only have about 40% of my data on a 2nd disk.      60% data is now lost and 300$ and days of backing up wasted.

I rushed to buy a new drive and landed on a 6TB WD drive [WD60EFPX], which I paid a decent penny for [pc parts are expensive here]. I managed to get most of the data out of the old drive into the new one, the old drive actually died at the tail end of the backup process, but ok, I still managed to get most of the data out.      Fast forward to last saturday, 2 months later. Something I left downloading overnight wasn't finished when I woke up and was giving a cycling redundancy error. I checked CrystalDiskInfo and there it was, Current Pending Sector count at 200.      Then I decided to order an external hard drive so that I could backup the most critical stuff and fully format the drive. A few hours before the external HDD gets here, the WD hard drive dies and my PC won't boot with it plugged, at all. It will show up in the bios, but that's about it.      I'm assuming it's over? Any chance at all that this could be something else? bad sata port? bad sata cable? Moody hard drive lol? I've already started the RMA procedure, just waiting to hear back from the company.      In hindsight I should have taken the 2 hour drive to buy the external drive in person. I live kind of remotely, anything PC related requires a trip. But I got lazy and that's what happens. This is the first time a piece of hardware just up and fails on me within 2 months of use. I guess it's bound to happen at some point.</Content></post><post><Title>Using HBA SAS card as SAS target?</Title><Author>u/fernandolcx</Author><Content>Sorry if this is a dumb question, but I was thinking about the meaning of "IT firmware" as "Initiator/Target" in storage terminology.      Let's say I want to build my own SAS-attached DAS.

I had a Synology DS916+ (8GB), with 4 x 8 TB ironwolves in raid 5 (SHR). It died (won’t power on, power cable seems fine), and now I need a new NAS. I am also looking to optimise my small network to increase the usability of the NAS.I use two laptops ( Mac and Windows) and try to keep all my files on the NAS rather than on the devices. I fly drones and often have to transfer a few hundred gigabytes on and off the NAS for storage or editing videos. I have generally been disappointed with the transfer speeds of the old unit over Gbe.      I created a scuffed diagram of my network. I would love to make my own NAS and get homeassistant off the old laptop that runs it, but my apartment is small. I have been looking at the DS923+, DS1522+ and DS1621+. The latter has an extra bay, and two extra GbE ports.      Is upgrading any of these things going to help me with transfer speeds for my use cases:(Transferring large files, editing from the NAS, Steam remote play)      1 - Either NAS being much faster due to the processor.2 - Using link aggregation on the NAS, with a new compatible Gbe switch (and the benefits of 2 vs. 4 Gbe ports).3 - Using link aggregation on my laptops via 2x ethernet connections to the switch, with an extra Gbe dongle.3 - Buying a 2.5Gbe switch, (with link aggregation?).4 - Buying a 2.5Gbe USB C dongle ( and also potentially using link aggrigation).5 - Buying the (expensive) 10Gbe module for either DiskStation.6 - Adding different name drives to these more modern NAS.      I am willing to use a number of these solutions, such as buying a 2.5 switch and dongle, running 4xGbe link aggregation on the NAS, and using 2 cables from my laptop on a new switch.      I am unsure how effective any of this will be. If anyone can shed some light on this stuff, or give advice on these NAS, I would appreciate it.</Content></post><post><Title>Help us DataHoarder, you're our only hope...</Title><Author>u/CriticalMemory</Author><Content>Hey folks, thanks for reading.  I'm hopeful this doesn't go too far awry of rule 8.      Several of my friends and I have been trying without a lot of success to mirror a PHPBB that's about to get shut down.  So far, we've either gathered too much data, or too little using HTTRack.  Our last run had nearly 700GB for ~70k posts on the bulletin board, while our first attempts only captured the top level links.  We know this is a lack of knowledge on our part, but we're running out of time to experiment to dial this in.  We've reached out to the company who is running the PHPBB to try to get them to work with us, and are still hopeful we can do that, but for the moment self-servicing seems like our only option.      It's important to us to save this because it's a lot of historical and useful information for an RPG we play (called Dungeon Crawl Classics).  The company is migrating to discord for all of it's discussions, but for someone who just wants to go read on topics, that's not so helpful.  The site itself is https://goodman-games.com/forum/    We're stuck.  Can anyone help us out or give us some pointers? Hell, I'm even willing to put money towards this to get an expert to help, but because I don't know exactly what to ask for know that could go sideways pretty easily.

They recommend for security reasons to use a different user in it's own group for each container.      The thing is shared folders are created as belonging to root/users, to which the container user has no permissions. Setting the user to have rw on the shared folders from OMV's web UI did nothing (not sure how it's suppose to since it's not owning or part of the owning group). The only way to fix this was to add the user to the shares' ACL. This just feels wrong, also that's not as described in the manual. Without the ACL, deluge is unaware of the permissions issue (since on the container side it's root), but nothing is downloaded or uploaded and trying to move storage location leads to errors.      Is the manual wrong or did I miss something?      Edit: Ps. with the ACL, downloaded files are created as owned by container-user / users, which is odd since the container user is not part of users, but at least that works for accessing via users' members.</Content></post><post><Title>Is there a 3.5 HDD case that turns off and on with the PC?</Title><Author>u/Automatic_Ad_621</Author><Content>As per the title, is there an external box for HDD 3.5 (2bay) that turns on and off together with the PC to which it is connected?</Content></post><post><Title>Best Sata expansion card at this time?</Title><Author>u/Heinosity11</Author><Content>Hey all,      So yea I did look first at some recent posts, but didnt find any super recent. I have a mobo with 6 onboard SATA ports and now need more because i need to increase my storage. I use windows 10 (yea i know its not unraid/truenas etc). I am not very excited of the options out there, but maybe im not looking in the right place. Btw, the card doesnt need to be RAID compliant...Just need it to not have IO errors and work correctly lol. Looking for maybe a 6 port card, but could do with a 4...And yes I have a pcie 3x4 slot for the expansion card on my mobo that doesnt conflict bandwidth with other things. From amazon I found this one by "IO Crest" (tried to link the page, but i think my post got removed for that-sorry huge reddit noob). Seems better then most because it has a 4.4 star review and lots of reviews...Another question I have though is which chipset is the best/most reliable? Looking at just this sale page there are JMB, MV and ASM. Obviously there could be others I am unaware of. Price really isnt a huge concern in the sense that if I can get a super tried and true/industry standard one for a little more i definitely would be down to do that. Anyways, thank you in advance for ur guys wisdom. I honestly was also debating swapping the drives with those 30tb seagate mozaic drives that are about to come out, but im not too keen on being the very first adopter..

Any ideas?</Title><Author>u/Dat_Cool_Guy33</Author><Content>Okay I'll try to explain the situation as best I can. I've always wanted to get into Data Hoarding but storing things on Local Physical Media isn't really possible for me at the moment. However, I do have a Basic Home lab setup with a Raspberry pi and a GMKtek Mini PC. The Raspberry Pi  has been set up as a Pi Hosted Home Lab. So as a little makeshift NAS, I hooked up a 2TB SSD to it and upload / download data to it through a File Browser container that points to it. Unfortunately no redundancy at all.      Then, Just today, I remembered my Old College account was still accessible and has unlimited storage available (or at least more than I'll ever use rn). So Here's what I'm thinking....is there any way to link my GDrive to my Home-lab NAS? specifically I would like some sort of system where it kind of acts like a one-drive or g drive for desktop relationship where my local nas is the client and my Gdrive is the cloud storage server.      Basically I want this to be my flow of data:      I store data on my Nas and whatever I use regularly stays on there      Regularly my Local NAS is backed up and fully and securely encrypted to G-Drive      Over time if I'm not using a file for lets say 30 days or so, The Nas storage used for that file gets cleared but if I want to access it later,  my Nas can just pull it from G-Drive, unencrypt it, and make it available to me again.      My gut is telling me there's some system out there that can do what I'm looking for but I'm not sure what it would be.      Also side note, I know that Duplicati and Rclone are a thing but I have other people that use my NAS for storage already and I want to keep it easy to manage where I don't have to dig through TB's of archives to pull a specific file their looking for or something.      TL;DR: Is there any way for me to combine my existing NAS with my unlimited G-Drive account and link it up in the same way Onedrive for desktop can sync files to a client machine when being used and unsync files when not being used and keep them on G-Drive? With good encryption if possible because I'm paranoid of google having that much of my data lol?</Content></post><post><Title>$1/TB find at local Bin Store</Title><Author>u/bozey07</Author><Content>No content</Content></post><post><Title>Toshiba Refurb Hard Drive Numbering</Title><Author>u/joetaxpayer</Author><Content>I am considering buying refurb drives.

Because the Nintendo Switch gives the option to screenshot and create 30-second long videos; I did that compulsively whilst I was playing 'Breathe of the Wild' (And other games, too, but not as many).      Because I tend to be a digital hoarder, I keep them all neat in folders on my External Hard Drive. Every video and image I took on my Switch still resides there.      Somehow (And I still don't know this happened because I didn't do anything) a couple of the folders got deleted and permanently removed. I obviously 'downloaded' a recovery software and got them all back, BUT; nothing having to do with soft or hardware can go smoothy - there's always [at least] one difficulty:The files are now corrupt.      Every video and image I took from 'Breath of the Wild' are now corrupt.      How did this happen and how can I uncorrupt them, please?      Many thanks in advance my life is in shambles.

My genuine dream is to have all of my favorite media stored on huge server/external hardware. Movies, YouTube videos, music and such that I could burn onto DVDs and give out anytime I want to. It’s really hard but when I have time I try my hand at achieving small bits of that but my long-term goal for the future is to eventually get people to help out or be a part of a team that did this (this is not me recruiting, or asking for archival help) I know this seems unachievable but even just a small fraction would be amazing.      I somewhat have an idea of how I would organize it, although I’d like to hear if anyone has a like-minded dream and how they would — or even ways that would make this slightly more easier than manually downloading a video after video. (There’s other stuff, but it is primarily videos. I don’t have enough drives in my arsenal to download over 720p rn)      EDIT: If anyone has tips for setting up a downloading stream to send files to a server via uploading it indirectly, that would also be amazing.</Content></post><post><Title>Finding 16tb exos drives suddenly more difficult on amazon?</Title><Author>u/TLunchFTW</Author><Content>Title.

But it's always been a concern. I usually switch to new drives frequently enough that it hasn't been an issue. And more recently been backing things up. It's part of the reason I've looked into raid setups. But is it possible to know when a drive is going to have issues and replace it proactively?      I assume there are drive health markers that will show when a drive is more at risk for failure, but I don't know how reliable, accurate, precise they are.      I have some hdds that are, at this point not being used, but are 15 years old and haven't had any problems.

I'm trying to pool the data from 10+ mismatch-sized drives into one single mount point and haven't had any luck finding a way to do while maintaining write access to the drives via that same pooled directory. SnapRaid has drive pooling using symlinks which works well for read access, but I need both read and write from the same location.            MHDDFS via MacPorts doesn't seem to install at all on Apple ARM architecture. I've tried replacing a ton of missing libraries &amp;amp; functions, but am still running into issues. DrivePool isn't supported natively and using via virtualization won't work for my drives due to most of them being either APFS or HFS+.            Can't seem to find a solution here and reformatting the drives to ExFAT isn't really an option for me at the moment.      Edit: Meant to update this thread.

Can I change the filesystem labels from PARITY3 to PARITY and PARITY4 to PARITY2?

Roughly 70% of the pics had chunks missing, vertical or horizontal colour bands some transparent some solid and other assorted visual corruption.  Today I decided to do a restore.      Restored the archive to a different location on the same laptop SSD. The restore was a virtual disk mount of a system image backup (from the built-in win7 system backup util).  Once the restore was completed I went back to the corrupt archive expecting to blow it away and found everything back to normal, all corruption gone.      Gave the SSD a health check - no errors or anything suspicious.

Been perusing multiple duplicate photo/file finder posts and found a bunch of recommendations I'm going to try.  Czkawka seems to come up a bunch.      Though there are a few comments about effectiveness of similarity, something no one touches on is the similarity between original vs. screenshot of original;      Ie. My partner has a bad habit of opening facebook photos on her phone then screenshotting it, rather than simply downloading the photo.  This usually creates additional details within this image: different dimensions, exif details, and details within the photo (black borders, cell symbols/buttons/icons, hovering chat icons, etc.)      I've used a couple photo finder apps, and even on low similarity settings, the apps cant seem to recognize the photos.

Is this behavior purposeful?      I made my first setup into becoming a true data hoarder and bought 3 16TB Seagate Exos drives + a 5 bay DAS.      Bear in mind I'm still relatively new to Raid. I'm running Ubuntu and using Mdadm with a raid 5 setup. I added a few movies to the drive and then transfered perfectly fine at around 100-150MB/s. I then tried playing them directly from that computer, however it would constantly buffer and at times not load at all. I then tried moving those movies back to my internal drive and it transferred at around 50-100KB/s.      I decided to remove the raid array and try using the drives on their own, which worked perfectly fine. transfer speeds were back up to around 150MB/s and the media files played great without stuttering or buffering.      I re-created the raid array, this timing using btrfs instead of ext4 (which is what I used last time) thinking that could make a difference. It didn't and the same issues persisted.      After confronting ChatGPT about the issue I found out there was a details command for Mdadm. After running that I noticed the state was "clean, degraded, recovering" and that the third drive was currently rebuilding. Which didn't make any sense to me as I had literally just created the array, also I already tested each drive individually before assembling the array by running a benchmark test as well as adding some .mkv files to each drive and playing them. None of the drives had any issues.      This also explains why I was having buffering and transfer issues with the drive. Since it's currently being used already to rebuild the third drive. "System Monitor" shows a constant read rate of around 150MB/s and a read rate of around 80MB/s.      I assume the third drive is supposed to be the redundant drive, so is this rebuilding part of initialization or something? Or is this not supposed to be happening? The rebuilding process is also taking an extremely long time, I've waited around 30-40 minutes and it's only at 2%.</Content></post><post><Title>SoftRAID RAID 5 (MacOS on Apple M1), 3x4 TB drives, all backed up to backblaze unli backup.

However, I live in India where 20TB drives are not quite easy to find. I was considering WD Elements because they seem pretty cheap in the US, but in India, they cost about $500. However, Ultrastar DC HC560 is available here at a much more reasonable price of $390. But I will need an enclosure for those. I would like to know if WD Elements are worth the premium, or worth the hassle of importing them from the US. What are the shortcomings of using Ultrastar DC as cold storage?

Most likely it will happen via a 1 Gig network connection as my 10 Gig gear will take a few months to arrive.      My concern is, that last time when I was copying over some 2 TBs of data locally, between two drives via rsync, it took like 2 days because of lot of small files.

For quite some time, I've relied on an 8TB Western Digital Elements external hard drive to store all my media, primarily movies and TV shows. While it has served me well thus far, I'm aware that it's only a matter of time before it fails, and I'd like to be prepared.      My plan is to employ two hard drives: one as primary storage for ongoing media consumption, and the other as a backup. I intend to manually run rsync every few days to keep the backup current. Although many suggest an offsite backup as well, I'm comfortable with just one backup for now.      Initially, I was considering another Western Digital Elements external drive, but after reading some critiques of external drives' reliability, I'm inclined to explore a different approach. It seems that investing in high-quality internal hard drives and housing them in an enclosure might be more dependable.      This brings me to the idea of using an enclosure without RAID functionality. I understand that RAID is not a backup solution, and that's not what I'm after. I envision an enclosure that can accommodate two individual drives, each accessible separately for manual backup operations. These drives could be swapped out for a new drive at any time.      An enclosure would be convenient, keeping both drives together and eliminating the need to handle an additional drive every time I back up. However, I'm aware that with most enclosures, both drives typically connect through a single controller. If that controller were to fail, it could potentially compromise both drives, so I need a solution that mitigates this risk.      My primary use case is watching movies, without the need for additional software. I prefer my drives to be inactive when not in use (off, no-power), only spinning up when I decide to watch something.      Considering all this:      Is there an enclosure that meets my needs, or do I have this all wrong?      What considerations should be made with respect to the connection types to the drives (USB 3.0, SATA, or stuff I don't know about) etc?      Given I watch media, what considerations should be made about the RPM of the hard drives? Or other factors I'm unaware of?      Currently, I have about 4TB of data (not a lot but I'd like to get bigger drives to future proof).      Need someone to point me in the right direction - any insights or suggestions would be greatly appreciated.</Content></post><post><Title>VirtualDub screen turns black when starting capture</Title><Author>u/mnsrmnsr</Author><Content>Hey everyone,      I'm having a bit of trouble capture composite video with VirtualDub. When I select my source, I can see the video image and everything works correctly, until I start the video capture, the screen turns black and the captured video is all black. I tried disabling the preview while capturing, it didn't solve the problem. My capture card has an s-video input and TV cable/antenna input. Both work as expected before and during capturing. I tried using an adapter to convert from RCA to S-Video, it works but the image is very blocky and looks bad, while the composite image when displayed looks correct (my VCR has only a composite output).      If I open VDub and the last selected source was composite, the image is black, I have to change it to TV tuner or S-video and then change it back to composite so I can see the image. But if I open the software and the last selected source was something else (the tuner or S-Video) then I can directly see the image, no need to change to something else and go back. I'm using the card's DirectShow as the device.      I know my setup is a bit old and by far not the best, but I'm just trying to capture family tapes in the best way I can, and I figured that since I can see the image but I just lose it when I start capturing then it must be a software issue that I might be able to fix... My setup: LG vlk9320w VCR DVD combo Philips SAA7130 capture card Windows 7 on intel i5 Desktop VirtualDub 1.10.4, and VirtualDub2      I'm trying to make it work with this setup because it's the only one so far that shows me everything that is on the tape and is extremely noise tolerant and doesn't drop frames when encountering noise, it shows me the image exactly as I see it if I were to connect my VCR to the TV. I have a slightly better setup (Blackmagic Intensity Shuttle + TBC + Macbook) but it doesn't allow for much noise.

I did a test on a folder before using it for serious things cuz I'm not sure I understand how its working but here:  https://ibb.co/album/Mc5FnV    So in the first pic, I made 2 similar folders on each drive, and then made them slightly different, adding files. Then I opened the main project file on drive 1 and changed something and resaved so the only difference was the modification time      Then using the Update Both command on Beyond Compare 2, it copied things over to each to make both the same, a combo of both. BUT it seems it messed up on the main project file because now only the one modified at 5:49 "this to" AND the undo file that go with it exists. I expected it to keep both, rename a copy or something. This would be disaster if it happened to my real files, good thing I didn't run it on the whole drives yet. Is there an option or something that'd keep both every time there's a same name different time scenario?      Also, for the future, am i using the best workflow here to save/edit?

My old HDD is starting to die (hopefully still salvageable).      For context, this used to be my main OS drive almost 10 years ago, but after building a new pc I just plugged it in as a secondary drive. Recently the hard drive disappeared after starting my PC; it wasnt appearing in file explorer. A restart later it reappeared, but the PC would experience large lag spikes every 5 minutes or so. Now its at the point where the PC won't boot with the HDD inserted via SATA.I temporarily removed it and set the SATA port to be hot-pluggable, so I can plug it in after booting. I tried this and any time I'd attempt to open the folders/open up Macrium, the application will just freeze.    I was hoping to load up Macrium with a new HDD plugged in, plug in the old hdd via hotplug SATA, and then clone that onto the new HDD and hopefully get a clean copy on a new drive. This doesnt work because like I mentioned, the software freezes as soon as I plug in the HDD, and continues as soon as I remove it.      What can I do to try to salvage it?

All of my other applications run in a hyper-v linux VM.      My problems with this setup are:      Stupid power consumption, even at idle, and a lot of heat. This box lives in a room that has cooling challenges already, and while electricity here isn't super expensive, it isn't free.      Inefficient software setup. I've been out of the IT game for quite a while, but I'm still under the impression that windows server has quite a lot of unnecessary overhead for what I'm doing. Maybe I'm giving too much consideration to this, but I like the idea of a freebsd or linux base OS for rock solid stability and better efficiency.      Inefficient storage redundancy strategy; with StableBit duplicating everything, my ~66.8tb of actual space is effectively cut to ~33.4tb.      While I'm still sorting out hardware options, I know I'm headed in one of two paths:      A low power consumption setup to run as a NAS with my existing drives, and a physically separate box for applications. I know this isn't the most efficient strategy, but I just like the idea. In this case I wouldn't need any containers or VMs on the NAS box.      A moderately powerful (but much more efficient) setup to do both NAS and application functions in one.      Regardless of which direction I choose, I'd like to see if there is another storage solution that can meet my needs and get me off of Windows. I've looked at various options like TrueNAS, Unraid, SnapRaid+MergerFS, etc., but I'm not sure any of them are a perfect fit. My challenges are:      Differing drive sizes (I'm always looking at the "best value" hardware, so I fully expect to continue to pick up mismatched drives)      Too many drives for a single parity drive (I think pretty much all of these solutions would want to see two drives used just for parity, and some require them to be the largest drives?)      I do not have anywhere to back up the ~28tb (when not duplicated) of data I currently have, so while not totally mandatory, it would be really nice to migrate without losing any data.      I've also had a recommendation that I continue using windows server, but strip it down as much as possible by removing unnecessary features and services.

During the day and at night the PC is off. I don't game on it.      I am looking to add an extra 20 TB harddrive, but there is a big difference in prices for these HDD's.      The WD Red pro is the most expensive, € 575,-. But the Toshiba MG10 and the Seagate Iron wolf pro are both around € 330,-.      Why is there such a big price difference? Because the read and writing speeds are almost the same (the WD is even slighty slower than the other 2). Which one should I buy?

My budget might as well be zero, with the exception of I just purchased 2 Western digital gold 18 terabyte drives.      I have a gaming computer I built in 2012, and I intend to multi purpose it for everything. Someone mentioned proxmox, and I was thinking of using that to run something like true nas alongside home assistant, and possibly store security camera video on a partition and possibly even use it as a plex server. The gaming computer has an Asus tuf motherboard, cpu is an i5 4 cores. Oh and a 750 ti card.      So I'm not asking for a lot of information, but I'm just trying to figure out if this is a horrible idea in some way.      That and also, what Nas software should I use.      As a side note I ordered those Western digitals from their website, and it's been like 5 days and it still hasn't even shipped yet...

My old HDD is starting to die (hopefully still salvageable).      For context, this used to be my main OS drive almost 10 years ago, but after building a new pc I just plugged it in as a secondary drive. Recently the hard drive disappeared after starting my PC; it wasnt appearing in file explorer. A restart later it reappeared, but the PC would experience large lag spikes every 5 minutes or so. Now its at the point where the PC won't boot with the HDD inserted via SATA.I temporarily removed it and set the SATA port to be hot-pluggable, so I can plug it in after booting. I tried this and any time I'd attempt to open the folders/open up Macrium, the application will just freeze.    I was hoping to load up Macrium with a new HDD plugged in, plug in the old hdd via hotplug SATA, and then clone that onto the new HDD and hopefully get a clean copy on a new drive. This doesnt work because like I mentioned, the software freezes as soon as I plug in the HDD, and continues as soon as I remove it.      What can I do to try to salvage it? Hopefully there's something I can do.</Content></post><post><Title>Way to digitize VHS home videos with current VHS player?</Title><Author>u/halfam</Author><Content>No content</Content></post><post><Title>Easiest way to backup disk from windows 11</Title><Author>u/cargt3</Author><Content>Hi,      I recently installed windows 11 on new hard drive.

I don't require very high storage for this so I am thinking of buying a 1 TB HDD but I am not able to decide which one to buy. I already have a backup of my data to cloud.      NAS HDD almost serves my purpose but they are expensive and some  have SMR which don't have very good reviews. Also from all that I have read online, NAS HDD are required to be run on some sort of redundancy like raid as they don't have built-in data protection or recovery systems.      Then comes normal consumer WD blue type HDD which are not rated to be run 24/7 but have built-in data protection or recovery systems.      I have searched all the internet and some say you can use a single NAS HDD but some say don't use them so I am really confused right now which one to buy.      EDIT: It should be TLER.</Content></post><post><Title>3D Printed JBOD Enclosure</Title><Author>u/FriedCheese06</Author><Content>Just wanted to share a project I'm wrapping up. Essentially, I needed a JBOD enclosure, but didn't want to fork out several hundred on a pre-built enclosure. After digging through this subreddit and a few others, I landed on using an external HBA card along with 3D printing an enclosure. The full setup is:      x8 8 Tb Seagate IronWolf drives (with capacity to go up to 16 drives)      beQuiet! Straight Power 11 650W PSU (had laying around)      Two SFF-8087 to SFF-8088 converter cards      x6 Noctua NF-P12 fans      Right now, I'm using an LSI 9200-8e card on the server side, but looking to swap that to one of the 16e variants down the rode.      Just dropping this in to say thanks for the posts that helped me get this wrapped up!

Or should I cough up extra cash for the EDV-7000?</Content></post><post><Title>YA Slow SSD-to-SSD Transfer Complaint</Title><Author>u/bread-it</Author><Content>I'm currently transferring 1.3TB of data from one 2TB Samsung T7 SSD to another. Both formatted APFS/GUID Partition map.      The drives are plugged into an OWC Thunderbolt Hub via ANKER USB C to USB C cables.      Progress thermometer is estimating 10 hours. That seems super slow.  Any ideas?      My Mac is running Sonoma. I realize thunderbolt cables would be faster.</Content></post><post><Title>N00B Raid question</Title><Author>u/CL4R101</Author><Content>Hello Fellow hoarders      I wanted to ask something that might be n00bish :D, I have a raided archive server currently with 30TB of storage, this is I think 10 slots with 4TB each, in I think Raid 5 or some level of redundancy raid.      I want to increase that to 18TB per slot, the reason is although only 50% of the 30TB is used currently, as I am switching things up with Proxmox, I over estimate the storage the VMs need meaning it's taking up more storage then originally.      My question is this, as it's sacrilege to delete data, our religion forbids it and the archival god will smite me :D, (I always say best to hoard data then physical stuff :D).      Is it safe to replace a 4TB with an 18TB disk, and rebuild the raid and do this 10 times? so you don't lose anything, I do have everything backed up, but recreating proxmox, mounting the disk and rsyncing the files is painstakingly slow, I did it once, I swore never again :D.      I don't have the authority or budget to buy all 10 disks, but can buy 2 disks every few weeks, until all disks are replaced, the remaining 10 4TB disks will be used on other projects such as the Windows Server (while holding back vomit :D).      It's worth noting these are SAS drives, I doubt that matters too much.</Content></post><post><Title>need advice on Chinese backplane (U.2, 8639 and sata disks)</Title><Author>u/jotkaPL</Author><Content>hi      I need some advice. Will I be able to slot SATA HDD's into this backplane?      My mainboard has 2 x 8643 and I have 2x 8643&amp;lt;-&amp;gt;8643 cables.      Is this SFF-8639 U.2 compatible with the SATA connector I have in my drives? They say it's SAS/SATA/NVME compatible.       According to what I can see here, sliding SATA drive to 8639 should be electrically and mechanically possible:  https://www.techtarget.com/searchstorage/definition/U2-SSD-formerly-SFF-8639</Content></post><post><Title>How would you go about scraping this audio?</Title><Author>u/Flowingblaze</Author><Content>I was wondering how would you all go about scraping audio from this website? I mainly want it for my Anki deck to learn the language and was curious how others would go about getting the audio files from the website in an efficient way other than using inspect elements "network" feature. All audio files are stored at https://www.talk-lenape.org/associatedmedia/sound/sample_sentence/NUMBER or https://www.talk-lenape.org/associatedmedia/sound/dictionary_entry/NUMBER from what I can tell. So It would mean probably just getting a list of all the numbers and downloading from each link. I wonder when would it end though what I mean is, how many audio files are on there website? The highest number I've seen is 16,638 from what I remember. This also assumes that each audio file is uploaded in a 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, etc. order and have been assigned that number in those links that I gave examples of above. Does this make sense?</Content></post><post><Title>Document scanner that produces sharp, crisp scans</Title><Author>u/Lauren-1234</Author><Content>Can anyone recommend an ADF duplex document scanner that produces scans with a high fidelity to the original?      The scans made with every all-in-one I’ve ever owned are low-quality. No matter how much I experiment with the settings, the text still lacks clarity and looks a bit fuzzy. Same with my Canon ImageFormula P-215 with ADF/duplex.      To get decent looking document scans, is the professional grade Fujitsu ScanSnap our only hope? Please tell me there are less expensive options out there.</Content></post><post><Title>Power cable extender for the 8 bay mediasonic dock?</Title><Author>u/thegameksk</Author><Content>Just received my dock and the power cable is really small.
