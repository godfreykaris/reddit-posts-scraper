I am looking to build an 8 bay NAS very soon with these drives,  https://www.ebay.com/itm/156046813385    And I'm trying to make sure I'm buying the right HBA...  https://www.ebay.com/itm/156046813385    It's clear to me that I need to read up more on ZFS, but am I to understand that with freenas or unraid, I can use ZFS to combine the 8 drives similar to RAID configurations? I am wanting to have some redundancy as well, similar to RAID mirroring.      Off to research ZFS a bit more!</Content></post><post><Title>One of Us:  For YEARS She Recorded Everything on TV</Title><Author>u/giantyetifeet</Author><Content>No content</Content></post><post><Title>What's most efficient and automated way to make copy of storage?</Title><Author>u/YousureWannaknow</Author><Content>So.. I managed to get my first backup for storage (tight on budget and stuff, and quite specific usecase where CD/DVD dominated HDDs, anyway) and I can't find one opinion about making it copied between two. No it's just cold storage drive I use when I need to access specific stuff, but mostly add to it, so there's no need to make sync after I will make copy of it (I'll just be adding on two different drives same stuff from another storage)..      What I found is.. It's reccomended to use software focused on that area of file operations. There are decent open source or free tools.. I have dilemmah wich of these I should use, but maybe there's some hidden gem you could recommend? Rsync - focused with good opinion, but commands line and no idea about speed FreeFileSync - GUI, rest as above did - I know that guy, I know it's missing a bit in speed but is quite tidy and could backup everything from one to another, right?      It's just rookie thing, about 4 or 5 Tb and 2 external drives connected via USB 2.0 (probably, tho drives use 3.0, but not device I want to use for it).. And I wonder what way will be best to make copy in less than few days 😅 sorry for language flops, I'm kinda messed recent days</Content></post><post><Title>Seeking advice regarding large storage options whether internal or external</Title><Author>u/__Y8__</Author><Content>I somewhat recently built a PC with one 2TB SSD (Samsung 980 Pro). With all my games, schoolwork, and content creation, I'm beginning to reach the limits of my SSD. I also have a 1TB external Sandisk SSD, but that's meant for my MacBook (I run Final Cut Pro off of it. Can't use FCP on PC unfortunately).  I'm essentially looking for the best value regarding large storage, longevity, and decent read/write speeds. Max budget is $200 but preferably $100ish. I don't mind if the storage device is internal or external. I have an Asus Prime Z790-A WIFI motherboard.    Despite building my PC, my knowledge regarding them is fairly low.

He gifted them to me a while back because, while he wouldn't admit it, his eyes are starting to go, and he couldn't enjoy them anymore. With the tablet he can zoom in as far as needed so I know he would love to revisit the comics once they are in digital form. Everything is in pristine condition with sleeves and backers, but there is nothing insanely valuable in the collection. He has a couple that are worth something, but most sit at &amp;gt;$10. That said, it would crush him if any were damaged so the scanning method must be non-destructive.      What I have tried:  Czur Aura Pro    Super quick, but random cropping and glare for days, even using the side lights. I tried using it with the official light box, outside the box, with 1-5 additional lights, with only external lights at every angle known to man, in a diffusion light box, with polarizers, etc. The only thing that worked 100% of the time was scanning while sitting on my back porch on an overcast day. I opened a ticket with their support and the response was "Make your room light bright enough, but do not have direct light shining on the book.". They didn't address the cropping issues.  Epson Perfection V600Epson Scan - Impressive for OEM software but inconsistent and changing the framing is a pain unless things are at perfect right angles.  VueScan - Sometimes it decides just not to scan, sometimes it scans and the image is black. When it does scan it does fine, but the auto skew is ~90% accurate which may as well be 0 because I have to adjust every single picture.  Silverfast - I was surprised at how much better the scans look, but the scans take 2-3 times as long as the Vue or Epson software. Also I have to take a prescan every time I move the page?      At this point I'm ready to hire a service if anyone has any suggestions, but I would really prefer to do the scanning myself because I plan on at least completing the series that he has, and probably expanding on them. I do have an R10 and an M50, so I could try some sort of diybookscanner.com solution, but that is a lot of effort for something that may or may not have different results.</Content></post><post><Title>SATA HDD/SSD diagnostic tools? HW or SW?</Title><Author>u/trapexit</Author><Content>After just having a drive failure (of course it happened while transferring data to a new drive) I was wondering if there was any tooling around that perhaps data recovery folks leveraged to help diagnose issues. I've got two drives right now (8TB Seagate Archive drives) that died suddenly. One seems like it could be a bad logic board and I do have another with not just the same general board but the same batch? (same qr code) but haven't transferred the ROM between the boards to see if that will address it. The other (the one that died today while trying to transfer data to a new drive) will spin up but then makes a sound like the heads are seeking twice and then spins down. As I understand that's likely a hardware problem and not as home fixable.      While the data one these drives aren't critical it would be nice to be able to better diagnose the problems to see if it is worth the hassle to try to recover them.</Content></post><post><Title>Does my enterprise HDD enclosure need a fan?</Title><Author>u/Top_Combination9023</Author><Content>I barely know anything about data hoarding, but I want to store PDFs, games and music outside my laptop and flash drives aren't enough anymore.

As I work on developing a robust backup strategy for my NAS, I wonder if QNAP offers a native solution that allows splitting backups across multiple external drives automatically, without manually dividing my directories into chunks of 4 TB each.      The rationale is that a 24 TB backup cannot fit on a single 4 TB external HDD. This becomes even more apparent if I expand to a usable 144 TB in the future. In that case, it would be impossible to find a single 144 TB external drive, as such drives simply do not exist.      So, is it possible to distribute backups across multiple external drives using QuTS hero 5?

However, having only one backup copy of my shit is not a recipe for success. Having one is as good as having none as I like to say, redundancy is crucial when it comes to hoarding my data. Important pictures are backed up, the most important of which are printed out.      My consideration here is whether or not I get a high capacity internal HDD @ 7200 RPM or if I buy a high capacity portable HDD that can take abuse and is less likely to be damaged by physical adjustments and movements. This is rarely a concern in my day to day but I live in an earthquake prone area and I would agonise over losing everything to some shaking dirt.      I can't do both due to financial constraints at the moment but the decision is as follows;      Do I get a second external USB HDD that will be slower and have inferior transfer rates BUT be more protected in event of disaster and any other events that may happen (dog with zoomies for instance.)      or      Do I get a more efficient and practical internal HDD (I imagine its also cheaper) that I suspect to be significantly more fragile and susceptible to sudden movements and will likely be lost in the aforementioned events.      If the internal is selected, should I acquire this before the sale ends? If I should go with an external what should I acquire? I'd like something larger than my current 5TB. I haven't used more than 1.1TB on it but I'd rather kick the can of running out of space a few more years down the road.</Content></post><post><Title>When an external hard drive dies, what is your strategy?</Title><Author>u/DrWho345</Author><Content>When Samsung and WD drives start acting up, it will be working for ages, then one day, it will be connected as usual and then, no matter what you do, it won't mount, you can feel it running in your hands, but nothing shows up on your computer, you disconnect, reconnect, try to mount it via command/terminal absolutely nothing is working... what are your strategies/next steps?

I am still a little baby hoarder with only about 15-20TB of data floating around my noisy 10 year old desktop-turned-HTPC. I was looking to expand to ~30TB (with room to grow of course) for a couple of initiatives and initially had been set on a rack and rackmount server or NAS chassis with a bunch of 3.5" bays for price-efficient spinning drives.      The cost though! Racks = $$$ Rackmount Chassis or pre-builts = $$$$!      Every penny I would save in drive capacity I would pay back in getting a nice (home-office) rack and NAS.

Specifically I am thinking about a Mini-PC running unRAID connected to a JBOD enclosure for disks or large/cheap SSDs.      What's the performance difference between a setup like the above and a low-end rackmount setup (which is at the limit of what I could realistically afford)?

Need 2+2 tb to start off with. Trying to be as cheap as possible. Will be storing all memories and irreplaceable things. Will get an external HDD for offsite backup. Also, I do not care about read write speeds. I just want my data to be safe and backed up at the end of the day for as cheap as possible, I will add new data maybe once a month if not even more rarely. I will be using my old motherboard (6 SATA ports) and processor. Will get a new 500 GB ssd for OS and new RAM.      Now here is the dilemma. I am from India and WD Purples are selling for 5250 INR each, cheapest. Next up, WD Blue is also selling for 6000+ INR. I can technically afford (but want to avoid at all costs) to get a 10TB UltraStar or EXOS for 22000 INR but I need two physical drives at least and my total storage need for backup right now or even 3 years later will not exceed 4-5TB. so a 10TB HDD will be useless, not to mention spending 45K INR on drives only (which is VERY VERY EXPENSIVE FOR ME).      I know WD Purple glosses over write errors and can be bad. Chucking is equally expensive, if not more. Should I just get 2x 2tb WD Purple for 10.5K INR and set up my backup server for now. Will add more HDDs later as needed (1-4 years later). Can I do anything to prevent the write errors?      Also, if there is a cheaper way, especially in the long run, I would appreciate it. Currently I have ~2TB data which grows by like 200-400GB a year.

I just wanted to add my $.02 after a recent experience with a failed drive I'd purchased a few months ago.      A week ago I woke up to a TrueNas notification that a drive was faulted. I did some troubleshooting and wasn't able to recover any kind of connection to the drive. Plugging it in to a external adapter resulted in what sounded like a rock tumbler, so clearly it was beyond rescue. I started a RMA with SPD, and went back to work; expecting a few hours delay before hearing anything back. Later I realized I'd missed their almost immediate reply to the RMA request. I explained there was no way provide smart test results, and attached a video of my new rock tumbler. In short order the RMA# was provided. I shipped the faulted drive, and didn't think much of it. The drive was delivered yesterday and my replacement shipped this morning.      Long story short, big kudos to ServerPartDeals for what is unprecedented customer service in the modern world; and to all the unsure shoppers, spend your money with SPD.</Content></post><post><Title>Migrate from Unraid to OMV, SnapRAID, mergerfs. How to keep hard links, that span between two drives?</Title><Author>u/ChrisWreck</Author><Content>I'm in the middle of migrating from Unraid to OpenMediaVault, where I'll be using Snapraid and mergerfs.      I have 3 disks, one parity and two data drives. They're using XFS in Unraid. I want to use ext4 in OMV.      I have formatted the parity drive to ext4, and planned to move data from disk 1 to the parity drive, then format disk 1 to ext4, and then move all data from disk 2 to disk 1 and make disk 2 the new parity drive for SnapRAID.      However, I just realized I have hard links from the arr suite, spanning over both data disks ...      How can I migrate and preserve the hard links? Preferably without having to move all data to one disk in Unraid before migrating.      EDIT: For those of you wondering why I'm switching, I'm actually switching from Unraid to Proxmox, but I'll use OMV to handle my disks (combination of ZFS and ext4) and shares.</Content></post><post><Title>What's the best way to transfer all my family's iCloud backups and device storages to an external media server?</Title><Author>u/sav-tech</Author><Content>Currently, the data is on an iMac Mid 2011, Google Photos and iCloud.

I have been hunting for the right location to ask my many, many questions. This may not be technical enough for this subreddit, but it seemed like the right place to go.      I'm a big fan of physical media, likely casual to most here but to my friends I am perceived as intensely pro-physical media. As such, whenever people have spare tapes, CDs, DVDs, etc etc, I'm the man they throw them at.      Unfortunately, I am horribly unfamiliar with the digitization process for everything except for CDs and DVDs, and even then I occasionally have hiccups.      Recently I purchased the JVC RC-EZ38S CD Portable System (link to user manual) from a flea market to play some of my tapes and CDs, and realized I had a few tapes I'm unable to find anywhere online. Usually I wouldn't worry about my tapes growing old from wear because I can download songs and save them that way, but these tapes (mostly Halloween tracks) were impossible for me to find elsewhere, so I've been trying to preserve them.      The JVC product I purchased plays CDs, cassette tapes, and the radio. It has one single 3.5mm jack, a headphone output. I have done some googling, and found my best bet to save the audio is through a combination of cables and Audacity. Unfortunately, my computer only recognizes my aux cord as headphones, and I cannot treat my JVC product as a microphone when using Audacity. I have two cables - one aux with two 3.5mm ends, and one cable that has a male 3.5mm on one end and the other end has two male parts, white and yellow RCA jacks.      How, if at all, can I use my JVC player to preserve the tapes I have? Is there a special cord combination I may be able to put together that won't put me out of house and home (I'm unemployed and in a somewhat difficult spot financially, even a $20 purchase has me aghast sometimes) or would I be better off looking for a different product to record my tapes? A friend of mine is currently looking to rehome an old car radio with cassette player - Do those typically have RCA plugs, and would that be a way to go about this?      Anything helps, even just correcting my terms so I can communicate what I'm looking for a little better - I'm in a space where I truly don't know what it is that I don't know. I'd love to be a part of saving some lost media, even if it seems a little silly. People put work into those Halloween tapes, dammit!</Content></post><post><Title>What are the best options for adding disks to my setup?</Title><Author>u/StarLordOfTheDance</Author><Content>Is it possible to transition my setup from mergeFs+Snapraid to zfs without a lot of spare storage that I don't have?

I built out my homelab to learn and get a job in IT. Mission success there. I've since gotten into all kinds of stuff and have a need to rework my storage, but I'm not sure how best to set things up.      Here's what I'm looking to do:      Complete separation of storage and compute Compute consists of a handful of VMs running on Proxmox, and critically, a Kubernetes cluster The cluster is currently running in VMs but I have plans to move just about everything into the cluster and move into SFF PCs This is partially why the complete separation is important, for flexibility and future migration      Here's what I have currently for equipment:      Brocade switch with 48x 1gbe and 8x10gig sfp 2x 12 bay 3.5" servers, one with Proxmox, one with TrueNAS 1x 24 bay 2.5" server Repurposed NetApp 24x 3.5" chassis, modified to work as DAS 4x 16gb spinners, currently in raidz1 ~32 old 2, 3, and 4gb spinners      I found that K8s cluster was very unstable with my first setup, which was an iscsi target on the TrueNAS server. The iSCSI share was mounted in Proxmox with LVM to create K8s VM OS and NFS storage for containers. This got much better when I moved to a local 3x SSD zpool on the Proxmox host. I understand that the latency with spinners and over the network was likely the cause, but this doesn't allow for the separation if like.      Use here is all over - media server is the main thing currently, which for transcoding needs fast seq read/writes, K8s app dev for work, and all kinds of testing containers for work and home. I'd also like to put all VM storage remote as well to play around with some different compute setups. I'd really love to be able to fully wipe Proxmox and try out XCP-ng, or Azure HCI, stuff like that... It's a lab, after all.      I'm competent enough to implement a solution, but I guess not enough experience yet to design. I'm not afraid of complex setup, but I do need redundancy, particularly if putting these small drives to use as I don't trust them - came for free with the NetApp shelf.      So... Any suggestions on how to set this up for minimal latency and fast read/write? Ceph? Mirrored ZFS using all those small spinners? Dedicated ZFS pools for each K8s node? Caching layers? Not against additional equipment, within reason, if needed.</Content></post><post><Title>Best at-home manual photo scanner?</Title><Author>u/Small_Vermicelli9655</Author><Content>Looking to digitize a bunch of old family photos and was hoping for specific scanner suggestions.

I managed to get my first backup for storage (tight on budget and stuff, and quite specific usecase where CD/DVD dominated HDDs, anyway) and I can't find one opinion about making it copied between two. No it's just cold storage drive I use when I need to access specific stuff, but mostly add to it, so there's no need to make sync after I will make copy of it (I'll just be adding on two different drives same stuff from another storage)..      What I found is.. It's reccomended to use software focused on that area of file operations. There are decent open source or free tools.. I have dilemmah wich of these I should use, but maybe there's some hidden gem you could recommend? Rsync - focused with good opinion, but commands line and no idea about speed FreeFileSync - GUI, rest as above did - I know that guy, I know it's missing a bit in speed but is quite tidy and could backup everything from one to another, right?      It's just rookie thing, about 4 or 5 Tb and 2 external drives connected via USB 2.0 (probably, tho drives use 3.0, but not device I want to use for it)..

He gifted them to me a while back because, while he wouldn't admit it, his eyes are starting to go, and he couldn't enjoy them anymore. With the tablet he can zoom in as far as needed so I know he would love to revisit the comics once they are in digital form. Everything is in pristine condition with sleeves and backers, but there is nothing insanely valuable in the collection. He has a couple that are worth something, but most sit at &amp;gt;$10. That said, it would crush him if any were damaged so the scanning method must be non-destructive.      What I have tried:  Czur Aura Pro    Super quick, but random cropping and glare for days, even using the side lights. I tried using it with the official light box, outside the box, with 1-5 additional lights, with only external lights at every angle known to man, in a diffusion light box, with polarizers, etc. The only thing that worked 100% of the time was scanning while sitting on my back porch on an overcast day. I opened a ticket with their support and the response was "Make your room light bright enough, but do not have direct light shining on the book.". They didn't address the cropping issues.  Epson Perfection V600Epson Scan - Impressive for OEM software but inconsistent and changing the framing is a pain unless things are at perfect right angles.  VueScan - Sometimes it decides just not to scan, sometimes it scans and the image is black. When it does scan it does fine, but the auto skew is ~90% accurate which may as well be 0 because I have to adjust every single picture.  Silverfast - I was surprised at how much better the scans look, but the scans take 2-3 times as long as the Vue or Epson software. Also I have to take a prescan every time I move the page?      At this point I'm ready to hire a service if anyone has any suggestions, but I would really prefer to do the scanning myself because I plan on at least completing the series that he has, and probably expanding on them. I do have an R10 and an M50, so I could try some sort of diybookscanner.com solution, but that is a lot of effort for something that may or may not have different results.</Content></post><post><Title>SATA HDD/SSD diagnostic tools?

I've got two drives right now (8TB Seagate Archive drives) that died suddenly. One seems like it could be a bad logic board and I do have another with not just the same general board but the same batch? (same qr code) but haven't transferred the ROM between the boards to see if that will address it. The other (the one that died today while trying to transfer data to a new drive) will spin up but then makes a sound like the heads are seeking twice and then spins down. As I understand that's likely a hardware problem and not as home fixable.

As I work on developing a robust backup strategy for my NAS, I wonder if QNAP offers a native solution that allows splitting backups across multiple external drives automatically, without manually dividing my directories into chunks of 4 TB each.      The rationale is that a 24 TB backup cannot fit on a single 4 TB external HDD. This becomes even more apparent if I expand to a usable 144 TB in the future.

However, having only one backup copy of my shit is not a recipe for success. Having one is as good as having none as I like to say, redundancy is crucial when it comes to hoarding my data. Important pictures are backed up, the most important of which are printed out.      My consideration here is whether or not I get a high capacity internal HDD @ 7200 RPM or if I buy a high capacity portable HDD that can take abuse and is less likely to be damaged by physical adjustments and movements. This is rarely a concern in my day to day but I live in an earthquake prone area and I would agonise over losing everything to some shaking dirt.      I can't do both due to financial constraints at the moment but the decision is as follows;      Do I get a second external USB HDD that will be slower and have inferior transfer rates BUT be more protected in event of disaster and any other events that may happen (dog with zoomies for instance.)      or      Do I get a more efficient and practical internal HDD (I imagine its also cheaper) that I suspect to be significantly more fragile and susceptible to sudden movements and will likely be lost in the aforementioned events.      If the internal is selected, should I acquire this before the sale ends? If I should go with an external what should I acquire? I'd like something larger than my current 5TB.

I'm using a free cloud storage that does not let a user to have multiple free accounts. I think limiting the log in time would make my accounts less likely being detected, especially not logging in at the same time. I have checked that rclone union would have to log into all accounts when something is being transferred. I wonder if mergerfs also has to do the same.      The reason I thought we don't have to log in to view the content is based on the idea from Virtual Volume View (VVV), which catalogs the content of removable volumes like CD and DVD disks for off-line searching. Would like to know if mergerfs could do the same or similar thing.

I am still a little baby hoarder with only about 15-20TB of data floating around my noisy 10 year old desktop-turned-HTPC. I was looking to expand to ~30TB (with room to grow of course) for a couple of initiatives and initially had been set on a rack and rackmount server or NAS chassis with a bunch of 3.5" bays for price-efficient spinning drives.      The cost though! Racks = $$$ Rackmount Chassis or pre-builts = $$$$!      Every penny I would save in drive capacity I would pay back in getting a nice (home-office) rack and NAS.      So I've come to you questioning a pivot point: What do you think about smaller solutions? Specifically I am thinking about a Mini-PC running unRAID connected to a JBOD enclosure for disks or large/cheap SSDs.      What's the performance difference between a setup like the above and a low-end rackmount setup (which is at the limit of what I could realistically afford)?      Any pitfalls I should be aware of?

Need 2+2 tb to start off with. Trying to be as cheap as possible. Will be storing all memories and irreplaceable things. Will get an external HDD for offsite backup. Also, I do not care about read write speeds. I just want my data to be safe and backed up at the end of the day for as cheap as possible, I will add new data maybe once a month if not even more rarely. I will be using my old motherboard (6 SATA ports) and processor. Will get a new 500 GB ssd for OS and new RAM.      Now here is the dilemma. I am from India and WD Purples are selling for 5250 INR each, cheapest. Next up, WD Blue is also selling for 6000+ INR. I can technically afford (but want to avoid at all costs) to get a 10TB UltraStar or EXOS for 22000 INR but I need two physical drives at least and my total storage need for backup right now or even 3 years later will not exceed 4-5TB. so a 10TB HDD will be useless, not to mention spending 45K INR on drives only (which is VERY VERY EXPENSIVE FOR ME).      I know WD Purple glosses over write errors and can be bad. Chucking is equally expensive, if not more. Should I just get 2x 2tb WD Purple for 10.5K INR and set up my backup server for now. Will add more HDDs later as needed (1-4 years later). Can I do anything to prevent the write errors?      Also, if there is a cheaper way, especially in the long run, I would appreciate it. Currently I have ~2TB data which grows by like 200-400GB a year. I have thought of BluRay drives but I am unable to procure new BluRay drives cheap enough.</Content></post><post><Title>Honey, I Shrunk My Server</Title><Author>u/sylinen</Author><Content>No content</Content></post><post><Title>Looking for help as a vlogging nomad.

I've been living exclusively out of my backpack + carryon luggage for the last decade and have been filming my travels as I go along. I've been traveling around the world and have amassed a large collection of 2/4TB Samsung T-Series SSDs which is beginning to bump up against the physical carrying capacity in my bags.      Lucky enough I've got a 128GB Pixel 1 that I use still to this day for daily remote storage + backup, so that has served me well.      However, I also like to have local backups, and have been trying to shop around for SSDs. I'm trying to keep things as compact as possible, and I'm traveling so have avoided going the HDD route since my stuff can get pretty rough and tumbled quite often.

I explained there was no way provide smart test results, and attached a video of my new rock tumbler. In short order the RMA# was provided. I shipped the faulted drive, and didn't think much of it.

I have been hunting for the right location to ask my many, many questions. This may not be technical enough for this subreddit, but it seemed like the right place to go.      I'm a big fan of physical media, likely casual to most here but to my friends I am perceived as intensely pro-physical media. As such, whenever people have spare tapes, CDs, DVDs, etc etc, I'm the man they throw them at.      Unfortunately, I am horribly unfamiliar with the digitization process for everything except for CDs and DVDs, and even then I occasionally have hiccups.      Recently I purchased the JVC RC-EZ38S CD Portable System (link to user manual) from a flea market to play some of my tapes and CDs, and realized I had a few tapes I'm unable to find anywhere online. Usually I wouldn't worry about my tapes growing old from wear because I can download songs and save them that way, but these tapes (mostly Halloween tracks) were impossible for me to find elsewhere, so I've been trying to preserve them.      The JVC product I purchased plays CDs, cassette tapes, and the radio. It has one single 3.5mm jack, a headphone output. I have done some googling, and found my best bet to save the audio is through a combination of cables and Audacity. Unfortunately, my computer only recognizes my aux cord as headphones, and I cannot treat my JVC product as a microphone when using Audacity. I have two cables - one aux with two 3.5mm ends, and one cable that has a male 3.5mm on one end and the other end has two male parts, white and yellow RCA jacks.      How, if at all, can I use my JVC player to preserve the tapes I have? Is there a special cord combination I may be able to put together that won't put me out of house and home (I'm unemployed and in a somewhat difficult spot financially, even a $20 purchase has me aghast sometimes) or would I be better off looking for a different product to record my tapes? A friend of mine is currently looking to rehome an old car radio with cassette player - Do those typically have RCA plugs, and would that be a way to go about this?      Anything helps, even just correcting my terms so I can communicate what I'm looking for a little better - I'm in a space where I truly don't know what it is that I don't know. I'd love to be a part of saving some lost media, even if it seems a little silly. People put work into those Halloween tapes, dammit!</Content></post><post><Title>What are the best options for adding disks to my setup?</Title><Author>u/StarLordOfTheDance</Author><Content>Is it possible to transition my setup from mergeFs+Snapraid to zfs without a lot of spare storage that I don't have?

I built out my homelab to learn and get a job in IT. Mission success there. I've since gotten into all kinds of stuff and have a need to rework my storage, but I'm not sure how best to set things up.      Here's what I'm looking to do:      Complete separation of storage and compute Compute consists of a handful of VMs running on Proxmox, and critically, a Kubernetes cluster The cluster is currently running in VMs but I have plans to move just about everything into the cluster and move into SFF PCs This is partially why the complete separation is important, for flexibility and future migration      Here's what I have currently for equipment:      Brocade switch with 48x 1gbe and 8x10gig sfp 2x 12 bay 3.5" servers, one with Proxmox, one with TrueNAS 1x 24 bay 2.5" server Repurposed NetApp 24x 3.5" chassis, modified to work as DAS 4x 16gb spinners, currently in raidz1 ~32 old 2, 3, and 4gb spinners      I found that K8s cluster was very unstable with my first setup, which was an iscsi target on the TrueNAS server. The iSCSI share was mounted in Proxmox with LVM to create K8s VM OS and NFS storage for containers. This got much better when I moved to a local 3x SSD zpool on the Proxmox host. I understand that the latency with spinners and over the network was likely the cause, but this doesn't allow for the separation if like.      Use here is all over - media server is the main thing currently, which for transcoding needs fast seq read/writes, K8s app dev for work, and all kinds of testing containers for work and home. I'd also like to put all VM storage remote as well to play around with some different compute setups. I'd really love to be able to fully wipe Proxmox and try out XCP-ng, or Azure HCI, stuff like that... It's a lab, after all.      I'm competent enough to implement a solution, but I guess not enough experience yet to design. I'm not afraid of complex setup, but I do need redundancy, particularly if putting these small drives to use as I don't trust them - came for free with the NetApp shelf.      So... Any suggestions on how to set this up for minimal latency and fast read/write? Ceph? Mirrored ZFS using all those small spinners? Dedicated ZFS pools for each K8s node? Caching layers? Not against additional equipment, within reason, if needed.</Content></post><post><Title>Best at-home manual photo scanner?</Title><Author>u/Small_Vermicelli9655</Author><Content>Looking to digitize a bunch of old family photos and was hoping for specific scanner suggestions.

My enterprise drives idle at 43-45 C which is ok, but could be a little better.      So i thought about adding a new and better fan to the enclosure (Icy Box IB-3805-C31), but the fan never changes speeds, literally never. I don't let my drives spin down but if they were to, the fan does stop spinning after a while, afaik that's the only control the DAS has over the fan. So if i were to add a 2000rpm fan, would it instantly shoot up to that rpm and always spin that fast? Is there a way to control fan speed?

After reading some posts, I thought about purchasing a license for Bvckup 2, which is more cost-effective and would allow me to use my other drives for backup.      My plan is to transfer data from the 5TB drive to one of the 8TB drives and periodically back up the data to the other 8TB drive. If I run out of space, I could use the 4TB drive similarly and back up data to the other 5TB drive.      While this might sound inefficient to experienced data hoarders, how bad/good is this idea? Are there any other software options that could simplify this process, compared to manually copying and pasting data between drives?</Content></post><post><Title>Seattle video store says it needs to raise $1.8M or face possible closure</Title><Author>u/justreddit2024</Author><Content>No content</Content></post><post><Title>Synology DS923+, DS1821+ &amp;amp; DS223j all on sale right now at B&amp;amp;H</Title><Author>u/iddrinktothat</Author><Content>** The sale has ended. **      Thought id let you guys know because i havent been seeing a lot of discounts on Synology.</Content></post><post><Title>Today I learned something about shucking</Title><Author>u/auridas330</Author><Content>I bought two WD elements drives, both are same size, manufacture date, drive number, but one needed me to play with the 3.3v pin to show up.

One EXOS 16Tb, two Barracuda 8Tb, one IronWolf 6Tb, on WD "white" 6Tb and on WD Red 3Tb. My main NAS is a desktop with +6 slots, my second NAS is a 4 bay Asustor.      Currently I don't use raid/parity of any kind... All drives are single volumes and it just sync's each drive from my main NAS to the second NAS, so I try to make the drive setup equal. However, the recent addition of the EXOS 16Tb kills that.      Since my main NAS is changing to a FreeBSD/TrueNAS with a ZFS pool, what's the best setup?      I was thinking maybe 8Tb+8Tb+6Tb+6Tb in the ZFS pool, then 16Tb+3Tb as single volumes on my second NAS. This way drives in the pool are as similar as possible in size and if parity wastes one drive, it will be about the same total capacity as the second NAS.

For anyone unaware, (almost) all SpongeBob episodes are split into A and B parts. For example, "Pizza Delivery" is only episode 5a, with "Home Sweet Pineapple" being episode 5b. Two "segments" make up one episode.      Normally this isn't a problem, as each segment in the SpongeBob DVDs has its own .mkv file. That is, until season 9, where there are no .mkv files for individual segments, only the combined episode. This is rather annoying as I don't want to scrub to the half-way mark of the videos just to watch the episode I actually want to see. I've thought of splitting the files in half, but it would be a tedious process as seasons are quite long.

My enterprise drives idle at 43-45 C which is ok, but could be a little better.      So i thought about adding a new and better fan to the enclosure (Icy Box IB-3805-C31), but the fan never changes speeds, literally never. I don't let my drives spin down but if they were to, the fan does stop spinning after a while, afaik that's the only control the DAS has over the fan. So if i were to add a 2000rpm fan, would it instantly shoot up to that rpm and always spin that fast? Is there a way to control fan speed? I can't see the DAS's fan on any program controlling fan speed so that's something...      Any idea on how it would behave? Any idea if there is a way to controll the fan speed?

If I enter `confidence interval` in the search bar,      Cathy will only find files that contain the phrase "confidence interval" in their file name.      Virtual Volumes View will find me files that contain both words anywhere in the file name, but it will also return files that contain either word in their filename.      I know that Cathy and VVV have come up before on this subreddit. I was wondering if anyone's figured out some portable freeware that can do Boolean search.

Storage workload is mainly Plex library, Seafile document/photo storage, and backups of other computers on the network.      I have 4 12TB HDDs that I was planning on setting up as a RAID1+0, and am debating the pros and cons of going for a full ZFS setup instead (as I understand it, the equivalent would be 1 zpool -&amp;gt; 2 vdevs -&amp;gt; 2 disks each).      I know that ZFS has the advantage of better integrity protection for bitrot etc., and depending who you ask is simpler to administer. It sounds like ZFS can also have better i/o performance depending on tuning, but I don’t think I really care about that for current workload. However, I know it can also have pretty significant memory and cpu overhead. I haven’t found much info on how much that actually is though, beyond the 1GB/TB rule of thumb for dedup. On a server with these specs, how much performance impact can I expect zfs to actually have? Is it enough to be worth sticking with RAID or is it overblown?</Content></post><post><Title>Easier to get a NAS or just buy another desktop with lots of storage?</Title><Author>u/El_Chupachichis</Author><Content>I keep contemplating getting more storage, possibly a NAS.

So please don't come saying get a 2TB NVME, get a 2.5 SATA SSD and yap yap yap.. And I have other systems too. One EATX, One MFF, Two SFF and One HTPC. So I am not a new builder. Posting here since it will be more appropriate than posting in Homelab or DataHoarder sub.      As we know it we have very limited SFF cases with HDD support. Manufacturers hardly make them anymore.      Some options that we have today:      Node 304: Outdated and front panel is very restrictive. 92mm fans in front are noisy as they are 3pin. In my country I can't find any 92mm fan.      Jonsbo N series: Pat on the back for Jonsbo on launching several SFF NAS cases back to back. They feel like they have restrictive airflow. They aren't available in my country.      SAMA IM 01 and its copies: Supports 4 - 5. A cheap knock of this is available. But is an option.      So my question is have you guys though about squeezing extra HDDs in cases like Deepcool CH 160, Coolermaster NR200P etc. For example if I can use rear fan mount for 120 AIO intake then does 120 fan slot above have motherboard has hinges for 3. 5"HDD? Does it have space to tuck one below a dual slot dual fan GPU. I know 1 3.5" HDD can go on front panel when I use a SFX PSU. Similarly for NR200P. More suggestions are welcome. I'll use a Noctua L9i or 120 AIO as I have then lying around.      I wish this post to be open for coming years so people can get ideas and inspiration from the comments.</Content></post><post><Title>Newbie setup questions</Title><Author>u/tranrep</Author><Content>Hey all, trying to get myself situated and not the most tech-savvy person so apologies in advance if I'm missing the mark. For context, I'm mostly a hobbyist photographer that wants to just keep my data safe and I don't believe I'd have a need for most of what a NAS offers, so I'm looking into DAS/JBOD as a solution. I currently have around 6TB of photo/video I consider "important" enough to backup.      My current setup is just a single 14 TB WD External HD which is not really being backed up anywhere so I'd like to improve my setup.      At the core, I'm currently planning on doing the following:      Buying a new 8TB HDD that I'll be "working off of", and moving all of my existing data into it      Buying a 4 bay DAS, either using 2 drives for now for RAID1 or buying 4 for RAID4/5 (??) to periodically mirror data from the single 8TB drive onto.      Using Backblaze to backup my PC + DAS.      Does this setup make sense for my needs? If it does make sense, does anybody have any particular product recommendations for the DAS/JBOD and if there's any specific thing to look for in the type of drive(s) to purchase? Is this perhaps overkill for the use case?

Are there are any concerns with XFS still?</Title><Author>u/ECrispy</Author><Content>This is for home desktop usage, not servers/data centers where XFS is far more common.      performance - in every test I could find, XFS is near the top, beating btrfs/ext4. Its esp good for parallel workloads and almost everything on a modern desktop is like that. The only perf concern I read about is it used to have higher cpu usage for updating metadata but I believe thats been fixed and no longer relevant?      (I think for most users, performance in benchmarks may not be noticeable and other features matter more, but its still an important consideration)      SSD/OS installs - XFS is almost as fast as f2fs for these. I see no reason why anyone would use f2fs on anything other than a sd card or on any NAND device with wear leveling.      CoW/snapshots - this is no doubt a very powerful feature of zfs/btrfs. But I see very little mention of reflinks/snapshots on XFS which can achieve a lot of this. They are not atomic but enough to satisfy a lot of use cases. I don't see support for this in the usual tools like snapper/timeshift either. XFS also has support for deduping. All of this comes without the usual cost of CoW      other features - dynamic inodes (on ext4 an inode for every 16kb/256kb is wasteful, even if most people never notice it), automatic fsck, journalling (sure, copied from ext3, but thats not a bad thing)      stability/reliability - I don't think there should be any doubt about this. Its a proven enterprise class fs with a hallowed pedigree and reputation, is now backed by RHEL and has probably seen more active development than most other file systems.      The biggest factor seems to be that the default ext4 is good enough, and frankly most people will not care or know about, and should not care, about the underlying fs. There are also distros like Fedora/OpenSuse that used to use XFS as the default and have switched to btrfs. I don't know of anything that uses XFS as default except unRaid now - unRaid is used to manage TBs by home users and that probably says something.      The only concerns I've found are -      a) it doesn't support shrinking a volume. how common is this anyway? I've never seen any home user need to do this, 99% of the time you only need this when you are installing another OS on the same ssd/hdd and need to shrink your current /, which is an advanced use case.      b)supposedly XFS doesn't handle hw failures. Even on this I found no consensus - some people say its risky and can corrupt with no recovery, others say even with a forced  shutdown its safe. I'm not sure if its any less robust than ext4/btrfs? Is this actually a concern these days?</Content></post><post><Title>Recertified EXOS X18 constantly reading?</Title><Author>u/wiadrovit</Author><Content>Hey there Guys,      I've bought a recertified EXOS X18 12TB for my NAS. The drive isn't exactly loud and it performs as I would expect, but there's one thing that I can't walk past - it acts as if it was doing something, even when completely idle.      The drive lives in my Sabrent DS-SC5B hdd enclosure which I've been using for over a year now and which I'm very satisfied with.      Video: https://imgur.com/a/o39cfd8 (it's the second one from the top - as you can see its LED is blinking in a regular manner).      I've read that EXOS drives have their own APM feature which can be disabled using seachest tool. I've managed to successfully disable both EPC as well as the power balance feature, but that didn't change anything, the LED still blinks and I can hear a regular, gentle cracking sound as if something was read/written.      The drive is mounted on my Debian installation and I've confirmed that no process is using it. What's weird is that activities stop as soon as I unmount the drive (and start again as soon as I mount it back).      In fact, this is a second drive that does the same thing. I've returned previous one to the seller as I've felt something is not right with it. Both were manufactured (or rather reassembled?) back in March 2024.      I should add that I have another EXOS drive (X16 16TB sitting in my backup device) and it doesn't act this way.      Is it normal for these drives or do you think I should return this one as well and go for something else?      It isn't that much annoying, I am just worried that if the head keeps flying all the time, the drive will wear sooner and might die prematurely.

So I've recently begun ROM collecting (might as well reveal that since my account is tied to it), and I'm faced with the best way to preserve this data, as well as use it infrequently. Currently the plan is sort of like a 2.5-2-0.5 method:      Leave a copy of smaller ROM sets on my desktop SSD (non-OS), but move everything else:      AND Offload collections (such as &amp;lt;system&amp;gt; handhelds) to 2 or 4TB 3.5" HDDs depending on the collection size and keep in "lukewarm" storage (plug into HDD dock for small updates, otherwise keep offline) [1]      AND from there, copy organized folders to accessible micro SD cards for the various handhelds (no power most of the time) [2a]      XOR copy organized folders to portable HDDs for the various consoles (off/idle, or online for maybe max 1khrs/yr) [2b]      AND Offload copy of entire collection to a large NAS. [3]      I have 6x 2TB HDDs, and 8x 4TB HDDs inherited from various places for the [1] and [3] tasks. So:      [3] For NAS, I am thinking 4TBx6 (-1) = 20TB in RAID5. This would be used for other files and backups as well (that's it's own problem).      [1] That leaves 2x6TB + 2x4TB = 22TB of curated backup/cold storage. Though I am thinking I leave one or both of the 4TBs for replacement drives in case of failure... so 12TB of 2TB drives.      That's sufficient for 2x copies (one online [3], one offline [1]) + the 'accessible'/usable copies [2] (kind of satisfying the "3" and 2 in 3-2-1). The 1 is a 0.5 since it would be in another room(s), and doing a truely remote location is not really in the picture for me. Really all 3 mediums would be in different rooms, likely.      My biggest concern is maintaining the 2 (well, 3) cold storage media types. Especially the microSDs, which I cannot find a definitive answer on how to maintain file integrity (seems like power on at least every year?, then somehow do a bit-by-bit rewrite?)      I've read up on store type archives, and PAR2 type parity. It seems like the best solution for long-term storage for a standalone, non-RAID drive (SD or HDD), would be to create a 10% parity file for every game (zip multi-file games), particularly on the microSDs which are most prone to bit rot.      I've had a lot of issues with microSDs in the past failing, so I have little faith in them. That means I would be forced to keep a per-card mirror on the NAS most likely (in place of the compressed versions for transfer convenience), and backing up any save games at least annually. But then what? Just wait until I try to access a file that fails? And what about the portable and internal HDDs?

Storage workload is mainly Plex library, Seafile document/photo storage, and backups of other computers on the network.      I have 4 12TB HDDs that I was planning on setting up as a RAID1+0, and am debating the pros and cons of going for a full ZFS setup instead (as I understand it, the equivalent would be 1 zpool -&amp;gt; 2 vdevs -&amp;gt; 2 disks each).      I know that ZFS has the advantage of better integrity protection for bitrot etc., and depending who you ask is simpler to administer. It sounds like ZFS can also have better i/o performance depending on tuning, but I don’t think I really care about that for current workload. However, I know it can also have pretty significant memory and cpu overhead. I haven’t found much info on how much that actually is though, beyond the 1GB/TB rule of thumb for dedup. On a server with these specs, how much performance impact can I expect zfs to actually have? Is it enough to be worth sticking with RAID or is it overblown?</Content></post><post><Title>Easier to get a NAS or just buy another desktop with lots of storage?</Title><Author>u/El_Chupachichis</Author><Content>I keep contemplating getting more storage, possibly a NAS.  But I'm not doing actual streaming, just collecting an ever larger amount of images, RAW and jpg (I'm an event photographer hobbyist).      I would look at the NAS online and see perhaps a cheap 4 bay NAS, then look at the reviews and see a lot of complaints.  Seems like getting a reasonably reliable NAS would be more like getting a high end desktop.      For those digital hoarders who don't have a lot of streamable data, do you prefer NAS or just a big desktop with a lot of drive slots, and maybe a software RAID?  I tend to be a cheapskate so historically it's always been "buy another drive that's larger and copy stuff over" but I really need to start thinking long term.</Content></post><post><Title>I'm using an SD card to USB cable to transfer some photos to my PC but there's only one file with no extension called "USBC ¬÷".

So please don't come saying get a 2TB NVME, get a 2.5 SATA SSD and yap yap yap.. And I have other systems too. One EATX, One MFF, Two SFF and One HTPC. So I am not a new builder. Posting here since it will be more appropriate than posting in Homelab or DataHoarder sub.      As we know it we have very limited SFF cases with HDD support. Manufacturers hardly make them anymore.      Some options that we have today:      Node 304: Outdated and front panel is very restrictive. 92mm fans in front are noisy as they are 3pin. In my country I can't find any 92mm fan.      Jonsbo N series: Pat on the back for Jonsbo on launching several SFF NAS cases back to back. They feel like they have restrictive airflow. They aren't available in my country.      SAMA IM 01 and its copies: Supports 4 - 5. A cheap knock of this is available. But is an option.      So my question is have you guys though about squeezing extra HDDs in cases like Deepcool CH 160, Coolermaster NR200P etc. For example if I can use rear fan mount for 120 AIO intake then does 120 fan slot above have motherboard has hinges for 3. 5"HDD? Does it have space to tuck one below a dual slot dual fan GPU. I know 1 3.5" HDD can go on front panel when I use a SFX PSU. Similarly for NR200P. More suggestions are welcome. I'll use a Noctua L9i or 120 AIO as I have then lying around.      I wish this post to be open for coming years so people can get ideas and inspiration from the comments.</Content></post><post><Title>Newbie setup questions</Title><Author>u/tranrep</Author><Content>Hey all, trying to get myself situated and not the most tech-savvy person so apologies in advance if I'm missing the mark. For context, I'm mostly a hobbyist photographer that wants to just keep my data safe and I don't believe I'd have a need for most of what a NAS offers, so I'm looking into DAS/JBOD as a solution. I currently have around 6TB of photo/video I consider "important" enough to backup.      My current setup is just a single 14 TB WD External HD which is not really being backed up anywhere so I'd like to improve my setup.      At the core, I'm currently planning on doing the following:      Buying a new 8TB HDD that I'll be "working off of", and moving all of my existing data into it      Buying a 4 bay DAS, either using 2 drives for now for RAID1 or buying 4 for RAID4/5 (??) to periodically mirror data from the single 8TB drive onto.      Using Backblaze to backup my PC + DAS.      Does this setup make sense for my needs? If it does make sense, does anybody have any particular product recommendations for the DAS/JBOD and if there's any specific thing to look for in the type of drive(s) to purchase? Is this perhaps overkill for the use case?

Are there are any concerns with XFS still?</Title><Author>u/ECrispy</Author><Content>This is for home desktop usage, not servers/data centers where XFS is far more common.      performance - in every test I could find, XFS is near the top, beating btrfs/ext4. Its esp good for parallel workloads and almost everything on a modern desktop is like that. The only perf concern I read about is it used to have higher cpu usage for updating metadata but I believe thats been fixed and no longer relevant?      (I think for most users, performance in benchmarks may not be noticeable and other features matter more, but its still an important consideration)      SSD/OS installs - XFS is almost as fast as f2fs for these. I see no reason why anyone would use f2fs on anything other than a sd card or on any NAND device with wear leveling.      CoW/snapshots - this is no doubt a very powerful feature of zfs/btrfs. But I see very little mention of reflinks/snapshots on XFS which can achieve a lot of this. They are not atomic but enough to satisfy a lot of use cases. I don't see support for this in the usual tools like snapper/timeshift either. XFS also has support for deduping. All of this comes without the usual cost of CoW      other features - dynamic inodes (on ext4 an inode for every 16kb/256kb is wasteful, even if most people never notice it), automatic fsck, journalling (sure, copied from ext3, but thats not a bad thing)      stability/reliability - I don't think there should be any doubt about this. Its a proven enterprise class fs with a hallowed pedigree and reputation, is now backed by RHEL and has probably seen more active development than most other file systems.      The biggest factor seems to be that the default ext4 is good enough, and frankly most people will not care or know about, and should not care, about the underlying fs. There are also distros like Fedora/OpenSuse that used to use XFS as the default and have switched to btrfs. I don't know of anything that uses XFS as default except unRaid now - unRaid is used to manage TBs by home users and that probably says something.      The only concerns I've found are -      a) it doesn't support shrinking a volume. how common is this anyway? I've never seen any home user need to do this, 99% of the time you only need this when you are installing another OS on the same ssd/hdd and need to shrink your current /, which is an advanced use case.      b)supposedly XFS doesn't handle hw failures. Even on this I found no consensus - some people say its risky and can corrupt with no recovery, others say even with a forced  shutdown its safe. I'm not sure if its any less robust than ext4/btrfs? Is this actually a concern these days?</Content></post><post><Title>Recertified EXOS X18 constantly reading?</Title><Author>u/wiadrovit</Author><Content>Hey there Guys,      I've bought a recertified EXOS X18 12TB for my NAS. The drive isn't exactly loud and it performs as I would expect, but there's one thing that I can't walk past - it acts as if it was doing something, even when completely idle.      The drive lives in my Sabrent DS-SC5B hdd enclosure which I've been using for over a year now and which I'm very satisfied with.      Video: https://imgur.com/a/o39cfd8 (it's the second one from the top - as you can see its LED is blinking in a regular manner).      I've read that EXOS drives have their own APM feature which can be disabled using seachest tool. I've managed to successfully disable both EPC as well as the power balance feature, but that didn't change anything, the LED still blinks and I can hear a regular, gentle cracking sound as if something was read/written.      The drive is mounted on my Debian installation and I've confirmed that no process is using it. What's weird is that activities stop as soon as I unmount the drive (and start again as soon as I mount it back).      In fact, this is a second drive that does the same thing. I've returned previous one to the seller as I've felt something is not right with it. Both were manufactured (or rather reassembled?) back in March 2024.      I should add that I have another EXOS drive (X16 16TB sitting in my backup device) and it doesn't act this way.      Is it normal for these drives or do you think I should return this one as well and go for something else?      It isn't that much annoying, I am just worried that if the head keeps flying all the time, the drive will wear sooner and might die prematurely.

So I've recently begun ROM collecting (might as well reveal that since my account is tied to it), and I'm faced with the best way to preserve this data, as well as use it infrequently. Currently the plan is sort of like a 2.5-2-0.5 method:      Leave a copy of smaller ROM sets on my desktop SSD (non-OS), but move everything else:      AND Offload collections (such as &amp;lt;system&amp;gt; handhelds) to 2 or 4TB 3.5" HDDs depending on the collection size and keep in "lukewarm" storage (plug into HDD dock for small updates, otherwise keep offline) [1]      AND from there, copy organized folders to accessible micro SD cards for the various handhelds (no power most of the time) [2a]      XOR copy organized folders to portable HDDs for the various consoles (off/idle, or online for maybe max 1khrs/yr) [2b]      AND Offload copy of entire collection to a large NAS. [3]      I have 6x 2TB HDDs, and 8x 4TB HDDs inherited from various places for the [1] and [3] tasks. So:      [3] For NAS, I am thinking 4TBx6 (-1) = 20TB in RAID5. This would be used for other files and backups as well (that's it's own problem).      [1] That leaves 2x6TB + 2x4TB = 22TB of curated backup/cold storage. Though I am thinking I leave one or both of the 4TBs for replacement drives in case of failure... so 12TB of 2TB drives.      That's sufficient for 2x copies (one online [3], one offline [1]) + the 'accessible'/usable copies [2] (kind of satisfying the "3" and 2 in 3-2-1). The 1 is a 0.5 since it would be in another room(s), and doing a truely remote location is not really in the picture for me. Really all 3 mediums would be in different rooms, likely.      My biggest concern is maintaining the 2 (well, 3) cold storage media types. Especially the microSDs, which I cannot find a definitive answer on how to maintain file integrity (seems like power on at least every year?, then somehow do a bit-by-bit rewrite?)      I've read up on store type archives, and PAR2 type parity. It seems like the best solution for long-term storage for a standalone, non-RAID drive (SD or HDD), would be to create a 10% parity file for every game (zip multi-file games), particularly on the microSDs which are most prone to bit rot.      I've had a lot of issues with microSDs in the past failing, so I have little faith in them. That means I would be forced to keep a per-card mirror on the NAS most likely (in place of the compressed versions for transfer convenience), and backing up any save games at least annually. But then what? Just wait until I try to access a file that fails? And what about the portable and internal HDDs? How often should I be plugging them back in and doing X?      tl;dr: How do you maintain microSDs and offline HDDs, how do you validate them, how often do you clone and replace them?

Also in my autorip script it is finding titles in ` TINFO` should it be finding them in CINFO.</Content></post><post><Title>Extracting Subtitles from Patreon</Title><Author>u/pinkwonderwall</Author><Content>Is there a way to rip captions from Patreon videos? I'm talking about Patreon videos I already have access to through a paid subscription. I like to save a video's subtitles as a text file so I can ctrl+F search for a particular word and find the moment that topic is discussed. I've tried Chrome extensions, but none of them work with Patreon. I've also looked for other posts of people asking this question, and it seems like not many people are trying to do this lol. I searched Inspect and Page Source and didn't see any obvious solutions, but I'm inexperienced with that so I may be missing something.</Content></post><post><Title>Exausted and burnt out due to caring for my data</Title><Author>u/CreativeDog2024</Author><Content>I have about 5TB of movies/tv shows/photos. I have 3 backups: one is my main frequently accessed HDD. Another is another HDD i keep in my drawer and the last is google drive.      I'm not a programmer so idk how to verify whether there has been data loss but I make sure all the files on each are the same by using freefilesync (mac app). It takes so much time and I don't even know if the files are corrupted or not.      Is there some cloud option that I can leave my data on and pay $10-15/month to forget about it, using it as a last resort if all my local backups are corrupted?      I read quite a bit on this and people recommend backblaze (B2 I think, how do i even buy it?), AWS glacier and M-disks.      I have no idea how to operate any of those because I don't code. I do use rclone for Gdrive though.</Content></post><post><Title>Western Digital DC HC580 (CMR or SMR?) &amp;amp; DS923+</Title><Author>u/sulicadiz</Author><Content>I just bought a Western Digital DC HC580. I don't know an effective method to know if the drive is CMR or SMR. I have read here in the forum that I should buy a CMR hard drive to use with the NAS (I have a DS923+).      Another question, before setting the NAS should I introduce all the drives I would be using?The NAS have 4 slots, so I guess the first step would be to buy 4 hard drive then set up the unit. I suppose If I insert 2 drives then the other 2 I would lose data.

I'm hitting my storage limit on Google and looking for a safe, local option. After losing everything on an old laptop that crashed, I started doing cloud storage, which is now becoming expensive.      My current laptop is an old HP and I have yet to decide between a new Windows laptop or a Chromebook. I have a Plex library I would like to expand, even bought an external DVD reader to start the library. I don't necessarily need NAS. Plugging something into the TV or my laptop would be fine when I want to watch something on Plex (which isn't very often). The same goes for when I need to do a regular backup of files. I would prefer to buy something once instead of paying a monthly subscription and to not add another constant draw on our power supply.      Most of the storage is for movies/shows, photos, and PDF scans of documents from when I went paperless. I would like to add music to this once I figure out a few things.      What type/size/brand of local storage would you recommend for my situation?</Content></post><post><Title>Best non destructive way to scan books with illustrations and photographs?</Title><Author>u/green__problem</Author><Content>I have a flatbed scanner and a phone with a quality camera.      For text-heavy books I use the CamScanner app, and then scan the cover using my flatbed. Non destructive, very effective. For magazines and newspapers, the flatbed is usually enough, as the lack of a solid spine makes scanning with minimal wear very easy.      Now comes my problem: I have a lot of image-heavy books that I want to scan, but I have yet to find a good method to do so.    CamScanner is horrid at dealing with illustrations and photographs. The flatbed works alright, but not great. Because I avoid breaking the book's spine, there are always visible shadows and both text and images become a little blurry when they're close to the hinge.  I'm wondering if there's an app similar to CamScanner but more appropriate for photographs? Or a different method altogether.    I know some people melt the glue keeping the spine together, scan the pages individually, and then glue everything back on. This wouldn't work for all of the books in my collection- but I have considered trying it on a handful of them. I'm just a little scared of screwing the process up.      Thanks in advance.</Content></post><post><Title>Dedup utility that FIRST finds duplicates by name/size/date, and THEN compares their content</Title><Author>u/Msprg</Author><Content>Hello,      Let me preface with: I know there are a million posts about dedup tools already. Dedup by file content, checksum, attributes, similar photos, similar videos…      Yet somehow, I failed to find any tools that would be able to first filter out the majority of files that differ in filename / date / size and then on the results make sure that files are 100% surely duplicate by comparing their content.      I've tried dupeguru, alldup, freefilesync, treesize, czkawka, I tried everything! (By voidtools that is).      The point is that I'm either missing something, or that none of the tools offer the option I'm looking for.      So here I am. Once again.

Is the live archive recording I get by using ytarchive a higher quality then the video I would get with yt-dlp that's processed afterwards? From my understanding the video goes through youtube's compression. Is the compression really strong in your opinion? I am wondering if it's worth getting the vod to save space.      Side questions:      Why do people put --format "bv*+ba/b" or something similar to get when yt-dlp already has it set to get the individual best audio and video as the default? https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp?tab=readme-ov-file#format-selection</Content></post><post><Title>Retire a drive after a single pending sector?</Title><Author>u/Most_Mix_7505</Author><Content>What would you all do?</Content></post><post><Title>New drives, questions about testing</Title><Author>u/lilbud2000</Author><Content>Yesterday I bought my first "big" refurb hard drives (2x12TB HGST drives, upgrade from a 2TB and 4TB drive).      The current plan is to have one in my computer, and use the second as a backup with an external enclosure. Probably not the "best" way to do it, but it should suffice in the meantime.      Currently waiting for them to ship and looking into the whole testing process in the meantime.      I was wondering what would be the best way to test them, as I've read about a bunch of different ones (like smartctl, Badblocks, HD Sentinel, etc.) And it's making my head spin a bit.      I guess my questions are as followed:      What/how many tests need to be run on a refurb drive? I've seen some posts listing multiple long tests and others just saying a few SMART tests. Is there any general consensus?      Badblocks is on Linux only, would that work on something like WSL? Or would I have to get a Linux machine/VM setup? I have a Pi 3 collecting dust, could that be used?      How long would testing the drives take? I've seen that a full badblocks 4 pass run can take days or even a week of 24/7 running just for one drive. Does that sound right? I was thinking about using a secondary machine like my old Thinkpad if it was going to take a week. My desktop (where the drive will eventually end up) is in use daily, and I'd be a bit concerned about leaving it on but not killing the test accidentally.      I'm a bit new to all this, only having a 2TB and 4TB drive for the past few years. Any help in making sense of all this would be appreciated.</Content></post><post><Title>Any experience with an Oracle Sun Rack II Power Distribution Unit RMII-PDU24KVA-3-HVHelp</Title><Author>u/Quadrix_hd</Author><Content>Hi everyone,I was looking for a PDU and found an Oracle Sun Rack II Power Distribution Unit RMII-PDU24KVA-3-HV for €60 on eBay.

Thank you!</Content></post><post><Title>Dual NAS Media Backup + Plex (a bit lost)</Title><Author>u/PuzzleHeadPistion</Author><Content>Hi,      I'm a bit lost on how to keep all my data safe.      Currently I have an old desktop, i5-4690 + ASUS H97 Pro + 16Gb RAM, with 3Tb WD Red + 6Tb IronWolf + 8Tb Barracuda drives and 2.5GbE + 1GbE interfaces. This works as my Plex server and it's where I dump files from the desktop/laptop, it's running on Windows 10 for now, but about to switch to FreeBSD or TrueNAS (or Proxmox?) with ZFS pool.Now I've added an Asustor AS1102TL Drivestor 2 Lite (2 bays, 1GbE) which is probably being returned for an AS1104T Drivestor 4 (4 bays, 2,5GbE). It is supposed to be a remote NAS using Wireguard, that's why I didn't care for 1GbE, but the initial backup is taking a LONG time. The price difference is only 100€ for more bays and speed (useful for full copies and full restores if needed). Here there's a 6Tb WD "white label" and an 8Tb Barracuda as single volumes (JBOD looks risky and can't use RAID with different drives).      Part of my issue is which file transfer protocol to use. NFS? My desktop and laptop are Windows, not sure NFS works properly. FTP? Or SMB? SMB is giving me speed issues, not going over 150MBps and for some reason when cloning the 6Tb IronWolf to the 6Tb WD "white label" the speed sinks to 10MBps. It's copying RAW photos and videos, like thousands of 50-100Mb files mostly.      Having file access sorted, what's your recommendation for file transfer/backup? Asustor Backup Plan? Paragon Backup and Recovery? Macrium Reflect? Or, since I already own SyncBackPro, just use that? This question is related to both, from my computers to the main NAS and main NAS to the Asustor.      A little guidance will be much appreciated, since I want to go through this once and "forget". My day job is IT PM so I know my way around a computer, but by far not an expert in this area. ty</Content></post><post><Title>General Reminder Backups are Important</Title><Author>u/TeamSylver</Author><Content>Everyone here probably already knows that.      I've just had all 3 drives in my desktop PC suddenly have problems.      Thank god I can still read/write to the drives though. It's just god awful slow, especially during data transfers, where it will render the whole OS unusable until it's done.      So that was a lot of pain and agony to temporarily move everything to the spare PC and laptops I have laying around (PC has 1tb, laptops have 1.5tb and 4.5tb).      Means I now have no backups at all, since I still haven't finished setting up my work PC to be my off-site backup PC yet (it's basically manage/byo PC at my work BC it's such a small store).      Annoying as well since that PC hosts my active directory and vaultwarden as well as the file server (thankfully I had a secondary active directory server set up, but no vaultwarden).      Gotta love Crucial NVMes. All of them only 11 months old. Never again. 2 of 3 RMAs processed but I still gotta get data off of the third (OS drive) before I can post that.      Edit: Forgot to mention they are Crucial P3 Plus 4TB NVMes</Content></post><post><Title>Advice on a crazy idea</Title><Author>u/Arcau1</Author><Content>I have seen a little N100 board with a 4x NVME hat on ali express (also comes in a N305 version)      I was wondering if it was possible to maybe use the nvme &amp;gt; 6 sata riser cards ive seen also.      So turning this into a little 24 drive beast of a nas,      So brain trust of the community i ask you:      Is this even possible?      Would it cripple the N100?      Would the speeds on the disks be just stupid slow?      Has anyone tried something like this already and have any words of wisdom?

Is there any way to losslessly compress this media? From what I've heard 1080p is best in h.264, which it is. The 4k stuff could be converted to h.265 10-bit, and I have done this with HandBrake, but I'm skeptical of how lossless it is since the file size reductions are ridiculous efficient.</Content></post><post><Title>What's the most HDD failures you've seen in a 6 month period?</Title><Author>u/the_Athereon</Author><Content>Genuine question. How many of you have had a year as bad as mine so far?      5 failures. 1 DOA      Parity 1 and 2 went in January      The first Replacement Drive was DOA      Data Disks 5, 8 and 11 have since failed.      I've been able to recover 90% of the data through the use of my backups and catching the problem in time. But seriously. 6 drives have died on me this year. And we're only half way through the year.      They're dying so frequently that I can barely afford to replace them.      Now. For the details.      Parity Disk 2 had a physical fault of some kind. Reallocated sector counts when from 0 to 256 in one night.      Parity 1 had a controller board failure (This will be a common cause. I've figured out the problem since this happened.)      Data Disk 5 kicked the bucket spectacularly. The Seek Error Rate went from 85% accurate, which is the average in my server due to how many disks are in there. To 1% in the span of 3 days. Making it infuriatingly slow to get any data off the drive but still possible.      Data 8 and 11 both experienced controller board failures. Strange drop outs in connection, hang ups, read and write error flags despite no data corruption either reading or writing. Obviously I couldn't trust those drives anymore.      But this thing is, only 2 of these failures are genuine faults. The other 3 are my fault.      The drives that had controller board failures, at least some of them, were due to how much pressure was being put on the sata connectors when I closed the side panel. Yes, I'm serious. In any other circumstance, the Define R6 would have ample room for sata power and data cables at the rear of the case. But when you have 11 drives and all their cables back there, the thickness of the noise dampening foam presses into those cables and puts dangerous amounts of pressure on the connectors.      I proved this by running read checks on the "failing drives" with and without the side panel on. With it off, 1 drive had errors 100% of the time. With it on, all drives showed the same errors. Errors which disappeared when I removed the side panel... SMH.      So now I need to replace yet more drives, the cables and the case.      My server is a bottomless money pit. It has to be.</Content></post><post><Title>Has anyone tried a drive bigger than 16TB on an older Areca-RAID-card? (1260)</Title><Author>u/flac_rules</Author><Content>I have an older Areca Raid-card. The manual claims it supports very large drives with 48 bit LBA, but i also found a google cached search result from the areca site that claims the following:      "The maximum capacity of HDDs for Areca RAID controller's old version firmware supports up to 16TB capacity. From firmware version V156-20190124...."      The newest firmware for the card is older than v156, but i don't know if this quote is for a particular card or in general, I can't find a complete changelog in the site for the changelog of the card I have.      So i know it is a bit of a long shot, but has anyone tried a larger than 16TB drive on a Areaca 1260-card or something of around that age? And did it work?</Content></post><post><Title>Best way to catalogue music</Title><Author>u/Foreign_Factor4011</Author><Content>I know this might not be the right community to ask this question, so if the moderators need to delete this post, go ahead.      I have a lot of music on my hard drive (we're talking 1000+ songs) and I'd like to organize everything into playlists.      Each .mp3 file has metadata and I have software to organize playlists. I think I'll create the folder like this:  Music/Genre/Artist/Album/.mp3 Files    Do you think there's a better way to organize it? I did some math and there would be at least 20% artists with maybe 1 music. There's another problem: some tracks aren't even part of an album. How can I improve this, if possible?

I currently have an adaptec 3514-16 with 16x12TB drives in RAID 5.    I'm debating about the size of the drives to get next but I'm guessing I'll get 16x16TB drives in a RAID 5.1 config but I'm not 100% sure   My collection hasn't grown that much in the last 4 years so 50TB will go a long way.      I've read many debates saying just get an HBA card instead of a RAID card but I've never actually seen any performance (real world statistics) comparing the two.   I'm still open to considering either one but would appreciate anyone who can point me to some real statistics vs opinion or based on what they've heard.   Your opinion may be 100% correct but I'd love some posted benchmarks.</Content></post><post><Title>How do you keep maxview storage manager open?</Title><Author>u/Deep-Egg-6167</Author><Content>Hello,      I like to check when a raid is building (takes a couple of days) what percent it is at.

Just manually download everything? No “download all” button anywhere?

I'm hitting my storage limit on Google and looking for a safe, local option. After losing everything on an old laptop that crashed, I started doing cloud storage, which is now becoming expensive.      My current laptop is an old HP and I have yet to decide between a new Windows laptop or a Chromebook. I have a Plex library I would like to expand, even bought an external DVD reader to start the library. I don't necessarily need NAS. Plugging something into the TV or my laptop would be fine when I want to watch something on Plex (which isn't very often). The same goes for when I need to do a regular backup of files. I would prefer to buy something once instead of paying a monthly subscription and to not add another constant draw on our power supply.      Most of the storage is for movies/shows, photos, and PDF scans of documents from when I went paperless. I would like to add music to this once I figure out a few things.      What type/size/brand of local storage would you recommend for my situation?</Content></post><post><Title>Best non destructive way to scan books with illustrations and photographs?</Title><Author>u/green__problem</Author><Content>I have a flatbed scanner and a phone with a quality camera.      For text-heavy books I use the CamScanner app, and then scan the cover using my flatbed. Non destructive, very effective. For magazines and newspapers, the flatbed is usually enough, as the lack of a solid spine makes scanning with minimal wear very easy.      Now comes my problem: I have a lot of image-heavy books that I want to scan, but I have yet to find a good method to do so.    CamScanner is horrid at dealing with illustrations and photographs. The flatbed works alright, but not great. Because I avoid breaking the book's spine, there are always visible shadows and both text and images become a little blurry when they're close to the hinge.  I'm wondering if there's an app similar to CamScanner but more appropriate for photographs? Or a different method altogether.    I know some people melt the glue keeping the spine together, scan the pages individually, and then glue everything back on. This wouldn't work for all of the books in my collection- but I have considered trying it on a handful of them. I'm just a little scared of screwing the process up.      Thanks in advance.</Content></post><post><Title>Dedup utility that FIRST finds duplicates by name/size/date, and THEN compares their content</Title><Author>u/Msprg</Author><Content>Hello,      Let me preface with: I know there are a million posts about dedup tools already. Dedup by file content, checksum, attributes, similar photos, similar videos…      Yet somehow, I failed to find any tools that would be able to first filter out the majority of files that differ in filename / date / size and then on the results make sure that files are 100% surely duplicate by comparing their content.      I've tried dupeguru, alldup, freefilesync, treesize, czkawka, I tried everything! (By voidtools that is).

The current plan is to have one in my computer, and use the second as a backup with an external enclosure. Probably not the "best" way to do it, but it should suffice in the meantime.      Currently waiting for them to ship and looking into the whole testing process in the meantime.      I was wondering what would be the best way to test them, as I've read about a bunch of different ones (like smartctl, Badblocks, HD Sentinel, etc.) And it's making my head spin a bit.      I guess my questions are as followed:      What/how many tests need to be run on a refurb drive? I've seen some posts listing multiple long tests and others just saying a few SMART tests. Is there any general consensus?      Badblocks is on Linux only, would that work on something like WSL? Or would I have to get a Linux machine/VM setup? I have a Pi 3 collecting dust, could that be used?      How long would testing the drives take? I've seen that a full badblocks 4 pass run can take days or even a week of 24/7 running just for one drive. Does that sound right? I was thinking about using a secondary machine like my old Thinkpad if it was going to take a week. My desktop (where the drive will eventually end up) is in use daily, and I'd be a bit concerned about leaving it on but not killing the test accidentally.      I'm a bit new to all this, only having a 2TB and 4TB drive for the past few years. Any help in making sense of all this would be appreciated.</Content></post><post><Title>Any experience with an Oracle Sun Rack II Power Distribution Unit RMII-PDU24KVA-3-HVHelp</Title><Author>u/Quadrix_hd</Author><Content>Hi everyone,I was looking for a PDU and found an Oracle Sun Rack II Power Distribution Unit RMII-PDU24KVA-3-HV for €60 on eBay.

Currently I have an old desktop, i5-4690 + ASUS H97 Pro + 16Gb RAM, with 3Tb WD Red + 6Tb IronWolf + 8Tb Barracuda drives and 2.5GbE + 1GbE interfaces. This works as my Plex server and it's where I dump files from the desktop/laptop, it's running on Windows 10 for now, but about to switch to FreeBSD or TrueNAS (or Proxmox?) with ZFS pool.Now I've added an Asustor AS1102TL Drivestor 2 Lite (2 bays, 1GbE) which is probably being returned for an AS1104T Drivestor 4 (4 bays, 2,5GbE). It is supposed to be a remote NAS using Wireguard, that's why I didn't care for 1GbE, but the initial backup is taking a LONG time. The price difference is only 100€ for more bays and speed (useful for full copies and full restores if needed). Here there's a 6Tb WD "white label" and an 8Tb Barracuda as single volumes (JBOD looks risky and can't use RAID with different drives).      Part of my issue is which file transfer protocol to use. NFS? My desktop and laptop are Windows, not sure NFS works properly. FTP? Or SMB? SMB is giving me speed issues, not going over 150MBps and for some reason when cloning the 6Tb IronWolf to the 6Tb WD "white label" the speed sinks to 10MBps. It's copying RAW photos and videos, like thousands of 50-100Mb files mostly.      Having file access sorted, what's your recommendation for file transfer/backup? Asustor Backup Plan? Paragon Backup and Recovery? Macrium Reflect? Or, since I already own SyncBackPro, just use that? This question is related to both, from my computers to the main NAS and main NAS to the Asustor.      A little guidance will be much appreciated, since I want to go through this once and "forget". My day job is IT PM so I know my way around a computer, but by far not an expert in this area. ty</Content></post><post><Title>General Reminder Backups are Important</Title><Author>u/TeamSylver</Author><Content>Everyone here probably already knows that.

It's just god awful slow, especially during data transfers, where it will render the whole OS unusable until it's done.      So that was a lot of pain and agony to temporarily move everything to the spare PC and laptops I have laying around (PC has 1tb, laptops have 1.5tb and 4.5tb).      Means I now have no backups at all, since I still haven't finished setting up my work PC to be my off-site backup PC yet (it's basically manage/byo PC at my work BC it's such a small store).      Annoying as well since that PC hosts my active directory and vaultwarden as well as the file server (thankfully I had a secondary active directory server set up, but no vaultwarden).

How many of you have had a year as bad as mine so far?      5 failures. 1 DOA      Parity 1 and 2 went in January      The first Replacement Drive was DOA      Data Disks 5, 8 and 11 have since failed.      I've been able to recover 90% of the data through the use of my backups and catching the problem in time. But seriously. 6 drives have died on me this year. And we're only half way through the year.      They're dying so frequently that I can barely afford to replace them.      Now. For the details.      Parity Disk 2 had a physical fault of some kind. Reallocated sector counts when from 0 to 256 in one night.      Parity 1 had a controller board failure (This will be a common cause. I've figured out the problem since this happened.)      Data Disk 5 kicked the bucket spectacularly. The Seek Error Rate went from 85% accurate, which is the average in my server due to how many disks are in there. To 1% in the span of 3 days. Making it infuriatingly slow to get any data off the drive but still possible.      Data 8 and 11 both experienced controller board failures. Strange drop outs in connection, hang ups, read and write error flags despite no data corruption either reading or writing. Obviously I couldn't trust those drives anymore.      But this thing is, only 2 of these failures are genuine faults. The other 3 are my fault.      The drives that had controller board failures, at least some of them, were due to how much pressure was being put on the sata connectors when I closed the side panel. Yes, I'm serious. In any other circumstance, the Define R6 would have ample room for sata power and data cables at the rear of the case. But when you have 11 drives and all their cables back there, the thickness of the noise dampening foam presses into those cables and puts dangerous amounts of pressure on the connectors.      I proved this by running read checks on the "failing drives" with and without the side panel on. With it off, 1 drive had errors 100% of the time. With it on, all drives showed the same errors. Errors which disappeared when I removed the side panel... SMH.      So now I need to replace yet more drives, the cables and the case.      My server is a bottomless money pit. It has to be.</Content></post><post><Title>Has anyone tried a drive bigger than 16TB on an older Areca-RAID-card? (1260)</Title><Author>u/flac_rules</Author><Content>I have an older Areca Raid-card. The manual claims it supports very large drives with 48 bit LBA, but i also found a google cached search result from the areca site that claims the following:      "The maximum capacity of HDDs for Areca RAID controller's old version firmware supports up to 16TB capacity. From firmware version V156-20190124...."      The newest firmware for the card is older than v156, but i don't know if this quote is for a particular card or in general, I can't find a complete changelog in the site for the changelog of the card I have.      So i know it is a bit of a long shot, but has anyone tried a larger than 16TB drive on a Areaca 1260-card or something of around that age?

I currently have an adaptec 3514-16 with 16x12TB drives in RAID 5.    I'm debating about the size of the drives to get next but I'm guessing I'll get 16x16TB drives in a RAID 5.1 config but I'm not 100% sure   My collection hasn't grown that much in the last 4 years so 50TB will go a long way.      I've read many debates saying just get an HBA card instead of a RAID card but I've never actually seen any performance (real world statistics) comparing the two.

Two days ago it's been announced that Great Russian Encyclopedia has been given no funding this year at all and the encyclopedia will be discontinued. (The encyclopedia is a heir to the Great Soviet Encyclopedia, and is fairly decent as far as general encyclopedias go.) Apparently Russia has bigger priorities than funding an encyclopedia... So, I think I might try my hand at saving the encyclopedia's online edition, before it 404s. Now, there are two domains, bigenc and old.bigenc (both .ru domains), and I'll focus on the latter. It seems fairly simple to rip, because each encyclopedic article has a corresponding PDF file, with the URLs only changing their final number (with 6 or 7 digits). I could produce a list of all the possible URLs in Excel. However, if I were to feed that list to a download manager, I'm wondering if that would cause any serious issues on the part of the server. There's probably close to a hundred thousand articles available on the site, and the downloader would also have to check possibly millions of URLs that contain no PDFs. Would this be like a sort of borderline DDOS attack? Could my requests be blocked?      Furthermore, even if I rip all that stuff, it would result in thousands of files with nothing in particular to identify them, as the filenames are just numbers. Is there a way to derive the article titles from the text within the PDFs (which ofc include the title of the article) and rename the files accordingly?

Well I have joined the club and am now the proud owner of a Supermicro 45 Bay JBOD Expansion Server Shelf 847E16-RJBOD1 with ~30 drives and ~460TB. Currently have it hooked up via 2 SFF-8088 to SFF-8088 cables to a LSI 9201-16e 6Gbps 16-lane external SAS HBA installed in my "server".      This is replacing my previous setup with the same "server", 2 x LSI 9201-16e 6Gbps 16-lane external SAS HBA cards with 8 x SFF-8088 to 4 SATA cables running to 8 x RSV-SATA-Cage-34 that are/were on a couple of shelves.      Been up and running for about a week and thoughts so far are:      It looks cool in the 4-post 42U rack      It is loud! (I knew it was loud but that holy s#$% moment when you first power it up)      snapraid backup/scrub is only happening at about 2/3 the speed of before (sort of knew this as well)      that was a lot of screws to remove the drives from the RSV caddies and screw them into the JBOD caddies.      It looks cool!      As mentioned, I have it hooked up via 2 SFF-8088 to SFF-8088 cables, one for each backplane, and am wondering if I can hook up the other 2 SFF-8088 ports on the JBOD with two more cables to get some additional speed. I did read the manual it it discusses the other two ports are used for daisy-chaining but you never know.      Not being one to let well enough alone, I am now on the journey to repackage my two "servers", one from above and the other used for acquiring linux ISO's, into a couple of 2U cases so I can get them nicely into the rack.      For the latter, am thinking about a RackChoice MicroATX/Mini-ITX 2U Rackmount Server Chassis as I am running a mitx MB and a couple of 3.5 drives and a couple of SSD's with no add-on cards so should fit just nice.      For the former, the "server" hooked to the JBOD, I am looking at this RackChoice 2U Rackmount Server Chassis as it allows full height cards to be used via PCI riser so I can keep using the HBA card I already have. The other option I am looking at is picking up a LSI SAS 9300-8e 12Gb/s SATA/SAS and a couple SFF-8644 to Mini SAS SFF-8088 cables and a 2nd RackChoice MicroATX/Mini-ITX 2U Rackmount Server Chassis but I am not sure if the SAS3 HBA is backwards compatible with SAS2 backplanes.      Anyway, the adventure continues ....

I've always played it super risky because all my data has never been properly backed up or duplicated. Now I want my files to be available between different (windows) computers. Ideally, every change would automatically get synced between both computers, through a cloud storage provider (that also stores the files for access from outside), as long as either computer is connected to the internet.      Now, plenty of services offer this, in its most basic form. I get 1TB OneDrive though my parents' family plan and OneDrive is pretty nice. It integrates well enough into Windows. But there is one major limitation that makes it pretty much unsuitable for me: I don't want all my syncable data to be in one single folder. I want it spread out over different folders and even drives, because I run quite a few different drives with different purposes.      Is there a service that basically offers a way to set custom endpoints for syncable folders? Say I have a cloud folder /Files, then I want a client that runs on any connected computer where I can set /Files to be synced to G:\Files, or to C:\Users\some_user\Documents\CloudFiles on another computer?

First app that I've seen for android that supports mounting arbitrary remote drives (google drive, WebDAV, SFTP) and supports streaming.  Had to manually add it to the battery optimization exclusion list on a OnePlus device (like in 3 different places, for background running, Optimize Battery Use etc.), or it would lose connection.    But after adding it to the battery exclusion list, I could reach over 280 megabits/s streaming 4K HDR video from a local linux machine!

In this case, is it okay to just build a decently powerful modern personal desktop - killing 2 birds with 1 s tone, instead of building 2 computers, one for desktop (desperately need the upgrade now) and one specifically for a server/nas? Is this totally okay?      I live by myself so aside from being a personal computer with data storage, it'll just be serving me alone at home. To be honest, at the moment, I pretty much just consume media on my desktop, so even nas/media server features like plex, jellyfins aren't even 100% necessary - though nice to have perhaps in the future.  Summary: Decently powerful personal desktop with a focus on datahoarding/data storage that can also perform some server side of things like running VMs, and other homelab things down the road.  OS: FreeBSD with ZFS + ECC Memory  CASE: thinking of a big case like Fractal Design Define 7 XL that is capable of holding 14-18 HDDs.  MOBO:  SSD: What's a good NVMe 2.0 ?(maybe 1TB)  CPU: amd or intel? what series/models would you guys recommend?  MEM: looking for ECC ram as the main focus will be data storage. but how much memory will I need for zfs (assuming I will fill up the whole case with 18 HDDs down the road)?  GPU: a gpu capable of driving maybe a LG DualUp 2560 x 2880 with a 34" 1440p 3440×1440 ultrawide monitor. I will also be doing some photo editing with darktable, rawtherapee, etc. as well so a designated gpu that is good enough should be enough. (don't think there will be much gaming).  PSU: how big of a power supply? keep in mind the full capacity is 18 HDD, with dual monitor, etc.  CPU COOLER:  HDD: thinking of 18 or 20TB seagate exos (are they too loud to use in the bedroom in a personal desktop? should i go for ironwolf pro?)</Content></post><post><Title>New Build raid/filesystem recommendations</Title><Author>u/NextRedditAccount0</Author><Content>I have a new HL15 coming.

And a lot of those modern used workstations don’t have a whole lot of space for hard drives.      What if this friend drilled a hole in the side of the case, ran the required power and data cables (SATA probably) out to a custom built case with a backplane and a whole bunch of hard drives?      I assume there are EMI and short related risks but frankly I’ve seen people run whole computers on open wooden racks with fans blowing on the components, function just fine for years, also don’t plan to touch/move things much and they’ll be off the floor and out of the way.      So anyway, all that being said, how stupid of an idea is this?</Content></post><post><Title>Adobe Document Cloud help</Title><Author>u/MatooMan</Author><Content>Looking to download local copies to my PC from the following publications, anyone able to help me find an automated way to do this?

Well I have joined the club and am now the proud owner of a Supermicro 45 Bay JBOD Expansion Server Shelf 847E16-RJBOD1 with ~30 drives and ~460TB. Currently have it hooked up via 2 SFF-8088 to SFF-8088 cables to a LSI 9201-16e 6Gbps 16-lane external SAS HBA installed in my "server".      This is replacing my previous setup with the same "server", 2 x LSI 9201-16e 6Gbps 16-lane external SAS HBA cards with 8 x SFF-8088 to 4 SATA cables running to 8 x RSV-SATA-Cage-34 that are/were on a couple of shelves.      Been up and running for about a week and thoughts so far are:      It looks cool in the 4-post 42U rack      It is loud! (I knew it was loud but that holy s#$% moment when you first power it up)      snapraid backup/scrub is only happening at about 2/3 the speed of before (sort of knew this as well)      that was a lot of screws to remove the drives from the RSV caddies and screw them into the JBOD caddies.      It looks cool!      As mentioned, I have it hooked up via 2 SFF-8088 to SFF-8088 cables, one for each backplane, and am wondering if I can hook up the other 2 SFF-8088 ports on the JBOD with two more cables to get some additional speed. I did read the manual it it discusses the other two ports are used for daisy-chaining but you never know.      Not being one to let well enough alone, I am now on the journey to repackage my two "servers", one from above and the other used for acquiring linux ISO's, into a couple of 2U cases so I can get them nicely into the rack.      For the latter, am thinking about a RackChoice MicroATX/Mini-ITX 2U Rackmount Server Chassis as I am running a mitx MB and a couple of 3.5 drives and a couple of SSD's with no add-on cards so should fit just nice.      For the former, the "server" hooked to the JBOD, I am looking at this RackChoice 2U Rackmount Server Chassis as it allows full height cards to be used via PCI riser so I can keep using the HBA card I already have. The other option I am looking at is picking up a LSI SAS 9300-8e 12Gb/s SATA/SAS and a couple SFF-8644 to Mini SAS SFF-8088 cables and a 2nd RackChoice MicroATX/Mini-ITX 2U Rackmount Server Chassis but I am not sure if the SAS3 HBA is backwards compatible with SAS2 backplanes.      Anyway, the adventure continues ....

I've always played it super risky because all my data has never been properly backed up or duplicated. Now I want my files to be available between different (windows) computers. Ideally, every change would automatically get synced between both computers, through a cloud storage provider (that also stores the files for access from outside), as long as either computer is connected to the internet.      Now, plenty of services offer this, in its most basic form. I get 1TB OneDrive though my parents' family plan and OneDrive is pretty nice. It integrates well enough into Windows. But there is one major limitation that makes it pretty much unsuitable for me: I don't want all my syncable data to be in one single folder. I want it spread out over different folders and even drives, because I run quite a few different drives with different purposes.      Is there a service that basically offers a way to set custom endpoints for syncable folders? Say I have a cloud folder /Files, then I want a client that runs on any connected computer where I can set /Files to be synced to G:\Files, or to C:\Users\some_user\Documents\CloudFiles on another computer?      Ideally also affordable and reputable/secure of course, and for single individual users?</Content></post><post><Title>Android RClone app mounts remote drives with random seek support</Title><Author>u/fourDnet</Author><Content>Found this nifty tool recently:RSAF - An Android Storage Access Framework document provider for rclone    Based on rclone 1.67 (latest version). First app that I've seen for android that supports mounting arbitrary remote drives (google drive, WebDAV, SFTP) and supports streaming.  Had to manually add it to the battery optimization exclusion list on a OnePlus device (like in 3 different places, for background running, Optimize Battery Use etc.), or it would lose connection.    But after adding it to the battery exclusion list, I could reach over 280 megabits/s streaming 4K HDR video from a local linux machine!

Or are there better ways?      For context:      I've been running a single ZFS pool with multiple mirror vdevs, effectively raid10. The ability to expand the pool with vdevs has been great. However, I've found out that failure with a single vdev (both mirror in a vdev fails) means failure for the entire pool. I realized this is because ZFS pools stripes data by blocks.      Recently I found out about MergerFS, which when writing, stripes data by files instead of blocks since it's effectively an arbitrator. External fragmentation shouldn't be an issue as I don't have insanely big files.      I've seen people mentioning MergerFS with SnapRaid.

I'm not asking for help doing piracy 101 or anything.      Hi fellow hoarders. I'm not sure if this is the right place to post this, but I figure this is a good place to ask fellow hoarders about what they hoard. Feel free to lmk if you think there's a better place to post this.      I'm trying to archive the different versions of Disney movies that have regional differences. For example, I have the different versions of Inside Out where Riley hates either broccoli (US) or green bell peppers (Japan).      Most movies only have a few variations, but Cars 2 and Planes each has about 7 variations each where the design of a car or a plane changes depending on the region. I've gotten nearly all of them, and almost all the variations of all the other movies, except for three:      Chinese Zootopia (secondary newscaster is a panda)      Russian Cars 2 (Car is styled as the Russian flag)      Russian Planes (the "sexy" girl plane is styled after the Russian flag)      You can probably see why I'm having trouble with these.

In this case, is it okay to just build a decently powerful modern personal desktop - killing 2 birds with 1 s tone, instead of building 2 computers, one for desktop (desperately need the upgrade now) and one specifically for a server/nas?  Is this totally okay?      I live by myself so aside from being a personal computer with data storage, it'll just be serving me alone at home. To be honest, at the moment, I pretty much just consume media on my desktop, so even nas/media server features like plex, jellyfins aren't even 100% necessary - though nice to have perhaps in the future.  Summary: Decently powerful personal desktop with a focus on datahoarding/data storage that can also perform some server side of things like running VMs, and other homelab things down the road.  OS: FreeBSD with ZFS + ECC Memory  CASE:   thinking of a big case like Fractal Design Define 7 XL that is capable of holding 14-18 HDDs.  MOBO:  SSD: What's a good NVMe 2.0 ?(maybe 1TB)  CPU: amd or intel? what series/models would you guys recommend?  MEM: looking for ECC ram as the main focus will be data storage. but how much memory will I need for zfs (assuming I will fill up the whole case with 18 HDDs down the road)?  GPU: a gpu capable of driving maybe a LG DualUp 2560 x 2880 with a 34" 1440p 3440×1440 ultrawide monitor. I will also be doing some photo editing with darktable, rawtherapee, etc. as well so a designated gpu that is good enough should be enough. (don't think there will be much gaming).  PSU: how big of a power supply? keep in mind the full capacity is 18 HDD, with dual monitor, etc.  CPU COOLER:  HDD: thinking of 18 or 20TB seagate exos (are they too loud to use in the bedroom in a personal desktop? should i go for ironwolf pro?)</Content></post><post><Title>For photos and videos backup, is it better to use a cloud-based storage service or buy an SSD drive?</Title><Author>u/jesuisapprenant</Author><Content>I got a subscription for Dropbox at around $12 per month, and I was wondering if it is worth it to just buy a 2TB SSD drive since overall the cost is much cheaper (a nice SSD with 500mb r&amp;amp;w is about $119 so that's 10 months of storage cost for Dropbox, so I break even at 10 months.

I'm prepping to do a migration to trunas and a set of larger drives and an also 9305 card but until I can get some new drives I'm limping along with this old card.      I currently have a RAID6 array of 9 4tb WD red drives. One degraded and it's been trying to rebuild. I'm currently running windows server 2016 essentials. I think something is causing the is to bsod while rebuilding the array. So I went into the cards bios to rebuild there.      Does anyone know if the card will rebuild while I'm in the bios screen of the card? I would rather leave it there and let it rebuild.      It could also be the drive is hosed and I need to buy a new one. Not sure why the drive went degraded except that we had a storm the other night and my UPSs battery apparently failed (less than 6 months old) and the server hard shutdown. The drives were unlikely to be writing anything as I don't currently write to that array. It's purely read operations.      Any help would be greatly appreciated.      *Btw I have backed up data to external drives, but I would still rather not lose the data as I could mount the array and make copying to the new array in trunas faster.</Content></post><post><Title>MergerFS on top of ZFS pools with a single mirror vdev</Title><Author>u/averageFOSSenjoyer</Author><Content>Does a setup mentioned in the title make sense? Or are there better ways?      For context:      I've been running a single ZFS pool with multiple mirror vdevs, effectively raid10. The ability to expand the pool with vdevs has been great. However, I've found out that failure with a single vdev (both mirror in a vdev fails) means failure for the entire pool. I realized this is because ZFS pools stripes data by blocks.      Recently I found out about MergerFS, which when writing, stripes data by files instead of blocks since it's effectively an arbitrator. External fragmentation shouldn't be an issue as I don't have insanely big files.      I've seen people mentioning MergerFS with SnapRaid. Which I don't see a point to if I'm just going to mirror.

The serial numbers do trace back to Seagate, but I'm experiencing some unusual issues with it. Has anyone else encountered this?      Here's what's happening when I test it with my Windows machine:      With the machine powered off, I plug in the drive, but the machine doesn't boot.      With the machine powered off, I boot to BIOS, and the disk is found. However, after rebooting, the machine doesn't boot.      If I unplug the drive after step 2, the machine boots normally.      If I plug the drive back in at the login screen, the machine freezes.      If I log in first and then plug the drive in, I can see the task manager showing max activity on my main OS SSD before the machine freezes. Unplugging the drive at this point unfreezes the machine.      I've bought a number of drives this way before and never had a serious issue. Any insights or suggestions would be greatly appreciated. In the meantime I am reaching out to the seller. The other drive I got seems to work fine.</Content></post><post><Title>Does anyone know the IBM TS3500 Tape Library (IBM 3592 JC/JY)?</Title><Author>u/_c0der</Author><Content>Hi all,      does anyone know the IBM TS3500 Tape Library with the corresponding IBM 3592 JC/JY type drives and tapes?

The serial numbers do trace back to Seagate, but I'm experiencing some unusual issues with it. Has anyone else encountered this?      Here's what's happening when I test it with my Windows machine:      With the machine powered off, I plug in the drive, but the machine doesn't boot.      With the machine powered off, I boot to BIOS, and the disk is found. However, after rebooting, the machine doesn't boot.      If I unplug the drive after step 2, the machine boots normally.      If I plug the drive back in at the login screen, the machine freezes.      If I log in first and then plug the drive in, I can see the task manager showing max activity on my main OS SSD before the machine freezes. Unplugging the drive at this point unfreezes the machine.      I've bought a number of drives this way before and never had a serious issue. Any insights or suggestions would be greatly appreciated. In the meantime I am reaching out to the seller. The other drive I got seems to work fine.</Content></post><post><Title>Does anyone know the IBM TS3500 Tape Library (IBM 3592 JC/JY)?</Title><Author>u/_c0der</Author><Content>Hi all,      does anyone know the IBM TS3500 Tape Library with the corresponding IBM 3592 JC/JY type drives and tapes?

Does a DAS fit my use case?</Title><Author>u/Stock-Belt-8470</Author><Content>I'm awfully "casual" about hoarding data so I don't have any sort of fancy setup at home. I just have a laptop and a box full of labelled 2.5 HDDs I've collected and swap around whenever I need to access them, but have noted the existence of NAS, DAS, and servers. I don't have too much of a budget to blow, so I was looking into some options such as "racks" (which I've learned definitely need a server or some tower for me to invest in) or DIY options for making something similar by myself which I'm not confident about. For example, I was confused for a while and thought bays were something you could connect just a power cord and USB for, but actually need to be connected as a network or hardware component.      I've looked into a DAS and they seem to be closer to what I want but I still wonder if any of this is all overkill for my use. I don't currently hold anything important on my drives at the moment and really use them to organize games and archives with the important stuff being backed up elsewhere. I just have a few USB enclosures, so the idea of having a box to set down and connect whenever I want to swap around data sounds nice, but given this isn't something I would leave plugged in all the time (I'm not at my computer often), I don't know if there are some caveats and considerations I'm missing out on. It's especially the case that I don't know if I need future-proofing as all of my drives are 2.5 and I don't see myself buying a 3.5 large-size drive anytime soon (in which I do have a separate 3.5 reader for a 300gb drive I rarely use).      So is the option there for me to get something I could easily plug-and-play into a device by USB? Or is it a pipe dream and something I should consider when I have a static setup like with a tower? I see all sorts of things from searching eBay and Amazon when it comes to enclosures but I'd like some more insight from you knowledgeable folks.</Content></post><post><Title>how to download videos from just for fans?</Title><Author>u/m300n</Author><Content>hi, i was wondering if anyone here knows how to save videos from just for fans?</Content></post><post><Title>Regarding Uloz.to</Title><Author>u/HakimOne</Author><Content>Hi,      Any thoughts on https://ulozto.net ?

Complete novice to home server operation.  After discussion in another thread, I've decided to not go with Windows OS on the server and instead run a Linux based OS so some sort.      My hardware is a i5-9500 with 8gb or ram. In terms of storage I have a 256gb m2 NVME, 2x 10tb HDD and a 256g 2.5" SSD if it is useful in some way. This leaves me with 2 sata3 ports(1 if I use the 2.5" SSD) and 1 m2 slot available for further expansion of storage.      Initial intended uses are to run JellyFin media server, Home Assistant and an image management app for pics, all local.      I would like full redundancy via raid1, this is where I'm a bit uncertain on approach.      I assume I'll run the OS and any apps on the NVME, not the HDD. Since i have the additional NVME slot available is there benefit to adding a second NVME drive for cache or even a mirror of the OS and apps?      Should I be looking to manage my raid with an application of some sort or in the Debian OS itself?      If the raid is setup in Debian, how does that affect future expansion? Do i have to add pairs of drives or could I for example just add a 18tb random drive?

I still don't know if its convenient or should i just suck it up and pay online cloud services      Do i need a NAS?

The drive is originally in exFAT with some warranty content on it. I have Windows 10, so not using badblocks, but have HD Sentinel. My order is this:      Minimum:  Short Long self-test (which will do an initial READ)      Surface WRITE+Read with default 0's      Quick format (to NTFS for use)      Extensive:      Short self-test      Quick format (to NTFS, solely for the next step)      Filling disk with large files (using TeraCopy verify+test using H2TestW)      Surface READ test      Surface WRITE+Read with default 0's      Surface WRITE+Read with 1's (0xFF)    Surface WRITE+Read back with 0's      Quick format (to NTFS)      Alternatively, badblocks instead of steps 5-7, or full u/EchoGecko795 routine below in the comments.      Thanks to everyone, all questions answered!      Some notes:  Extended self-test can be skipped, as it just short self-test + READ test sequence within the drive, just less informative than the Surface read test as doesn't consider connectivity performance  Full format in Windows isn't needed, as it's the same as Surface READ + WRITE (with 0's) tests, maybe more limited, and quick format is enough just to change the filesystem      Different surface write+read patterns emulate the 4-pass badblocks test      A few things I wanted to clarify:      how redundant is filling the drive with files, considering further WRITE+Read surface test? Does it only serve as another WRITE pass, just with different data?      do I really need the Read test before the WRITE+Read test, or is the latter enough? (i.e. can a READ before WRITE indicate something that a READ after WRITE won't?). My idea was to see the initial READ after the drive is filled with files, then overwriting it with 0's and reading again      how important is changing the pattern/flipping 0's to 1's?      should I flip 1's to 0's back again? Can the 1's pattern remain, following a quick format prior to using the drive?      And finally, is the more time-consuming 3-4 pass procedure really worth it, and not an overkill?</Content></post><post><Title>PlutoTV - Downloading episodes from live channel (ondemand not available)</Title><Author>u/pstNN</Author><Content>Hi all,      I've been waiting for this show to be released online for ages and it just released this week, however, there doesn't seem to be any plans to make it on demand, which means I cant use StreamFab.

It does not store data on the servers - rather, two devices have to be online at the same time for data to be synced. It's been a while so I don't remember the mechanisms through which it operates      There are a couple of downsides. First being that wireless syncing is slow, second being that errors are more common with wireless syncing (from my experiences).      Imagine a folder and imagine that every day I make a few changes to the files within it. I need the ability to sync all the changes within the folder for 2 devices. If I do not sync them, I would have to comb the entire folder for every change and apply them one by one OR delete the folder and paste the updated folder from my PC.

Since the reason for archiving is to safeguard a friend of mine for a potential legal dispute, I don't think saving it offline is enough, since an offline archive may be manipulated.      Does anyone know of an archival site that is able to capture the second step of this page?

I am considering starting hoarding files on physical drives since my online cloud is full and i don't want to pay a monthly fee. A couple questions:      Should i? I need space to save personal files, photos and videos. Right now i think i could have all my storage done with 1TB, but for the sake of futereproofing and redundancy i think i should aim for 4TB. I still don't know if its convenient or should i just suck it up and pay online cloud services      Do i need a NAS? I do all my work from my main computer so what i am basically thinking is just to add a RAID 5 HDD to my existing setup and call it a day, is there some reason i should NOT do?      Since HDD tend to get noisy i'd like to shut them off when they are not needed, this way i can save energy as well</Content></post><post><Title>Twitter extension to download videos inside the page</Title><Author>u/findthatgayporn</Author><Content>Anyone knows a good one?

The drive is originally in exFAT with some warranty content on it. I have Windows 10, so not using badblocks, but have HD Sentinel. My order is this:      Minimum:  Short Long self-test (which will do an initial READ)      Surface WRITE+Read with default 0's      Quick format (to NTFS for use)      Extensive:      Short self-test      Quick format (to NTFS, solely for the next step)      Filling disk with large files (using TeraCopy verify+test using H2TestW)      Surface READ test      Surface WRITE+Read with default 0's      Surface WRITE+Read with 1's (0xFF)    Surface WRITE+Read back with 0's      Quick format (to NTFS)      Alternatively, badblocks instead of steps 5-7, or full u/EchoGecko795 routine below in the comments.      Thanks to everyone, all questions answered!      Some notes:  Extended self-test can be skipped, as it just short self-test + READ test sequence within the drive, just less informative than the Surface read test as doesn't consider connectivity performance  Full format in Windows isn't needed, as it's the same as Surface READ + WRITE (with 0's) tests, maybe more limited, and quick format is enough just to change the filesystem      Different surface write+read patterns emulate the 4-pass badblocks test      A few things I wanted to clarify:      how redundant is filling the drive with files, considering further WRITE+Read surface test? Does it only serve as another WRITE pass, just with different data?      do I really need the Read test before the WRITE+Read test, or is the latter enough? (i.e. can a READ before WRITE indicate something that a READ after WRITE won't?). My idea was to see the initial READ after the drive is filled with files, then overwriting it with 0's and reading again      how important is changing the pattern/flipping 0's to 1's?      should I flip 1's to 0's back again? Can the 1's pattern remain, following a quick format prior to using the drive?      And finally, is the more time-consuming 3-4 pass procedure really worth it, and not an overkill?</Content></post><post><Title>PlutoTV - Downloading episodes from live channel (ondemand not available)</Title><Author>u/pstNN</Author><Content>Hi all,      I've been waiting for this show to be released online for ages and it just released this week, however, there doesn't seem to be any plans to make it on demand, which means I cant use StreamFab.

It does not store data on the servers - rather, two devices have to be online at the same time for data to be synced. It's been a while so I don't remember the mechanisms through which it operates      There are a couple of downsides. First being that wireless syncing is slow, second being that errors are more common with wireless syncing (from my experiences).      Imagine a folder and imagine that every day I make a few changes to the files within it. I need the ability to sync all the changes within the folder for 2 devices. If I do not sync them, I would have to comb the entire folder for every change and apply them one by one OR delete the folder and paste the updated folder from my PC. It is around 50GB so it would take a while to paste      I'd probably sync twice a week</Content></post><post><Title>Moving large files online?</Title><Author>u/ParticularTreacle446</Author><Content>I need to send a large number of files over the internet without the need of buying hardware. i came accross this website has anyone used it? if so please share your thoughts.tempfile.me</Content></post><post><Title>RAID 5 controller for Win 11 Workstation</Title><Author>u/Heinrich_v_Schimmer</Author><Content>As a photographer, I generate more than a TByte of data per month and therefore have a RAID 5 on my work system.

I also have a backblaze B2 bucket I will use for cloud storage.  I would like to use the homelab PC as a sort of cache drive where when I am at home I can use it, and when I am away I can connect to my backblaze b2 bucket directly from my laptop.  For example, I could open a word doc, make a few changes, and it would sync automatically to my cloud and NAS.  However the cloud would have more storage so I envision a scenario where my laptop would run out of space so I would keep some files "cloud only" and they would be on the NAS when at home or in the backblaze cloud when away.  However, some files I might want to only keep in the cloud and not on my laptop or NAS.

What if they never actually shared any media or websites, and instead gave a series of links to libraryofbabel.info (or similar website modified to generate random html code) which would conatain either the direct text or the source code of the designated media?      By doing this they would be able to circumvent copyright laws as anything they share would be the product of randomly generated code and they would simply be telling you where to find it as opposed to sharing the image      secondly, what if we made a website like this but for compression? Instead of needing 400mb of compressed files you could have a 2mb text file that links you to the necessary pages      TLDR instead of compressing the entire bee movie script you would only need to compress a text folder containing 1-10 of "https://libraryofbabel.info/bookmark.cgi?bee_movie_script_random)" and write a program to decrypt them</Content></post><post><Title>looking for something similar to Qsync</Title><Author>u/niloproject</Author><Content>Hi everyone, I could use some help. I've put together a NAS for my business and I was wondering if there were any alternatives to Qnap Qsync that would work with Truenas. (I also asked this in the truenas server but figured it would hurt to ask here too). The functionality in specific that I'm looking for is the ability to create users that can then establish a two way sync with the server, but similar to with Qsync, there would ideally be a smart sync that would only download what users actually need locally and not anything that isn't necessary to their work so they're not having to deal with terabytes of storage being synced.  They could then work directly on the mounted drive from their machines and anything they create will be synced to everyone and they won't have to worry about manually downloading/duplicating files on the server.      When building this I didn't realize how hard it would be to find a tool for this, and everything I've found just isn't very useful. Syncthing is not helpful, its not smart and would require everyone mirror 20tb of files (unless im misunderstanding what it does.) SMB sharing technically works but is too slow for people to work off of for our purposes as our files have huge datarates (multilayer EXR sequences, 1gb a frame kind of stuff).  I'm also experimenting with Google Workspace to see if that works any better for this but I'd figure I'd ask for help before I go down that road.      If any of you have any experience with this or could maybe point me to a client-side software that can manage client side downloads from the server in a smart way like Qsync that would be amazing.</Content></post><post><Title>Need recommendations for USB3 or eSata external drive to connect to router for FTP server.</Title><Author>u/mufasis</Author><Content>What’s going on data hoarders.

Want to upgrade storage and reasonably future-proof as best as possible. Considering changing my setup from PC (Plex Media Server) + external HDD (media storage), to a mini PC (Plex) + DAS. Could use advice.    Hi, I've done some research on upgrading my current Plex / general media storage setup and I've come up with a plan that looks something like the below. Please share any constructive criticisms, tips, things I might have overlooked, etc. I want to do this right the first time around.      Use case: 1-2 simultaneous 1080p streams, most clients will be able to directly play my mostly HEVC (h.265) content without needing to transcode. Not all, though, so transcoding option is nice.

If this looks good, I have a bonus question: How do I safely move my content on my current 12TB external hard drive to the DAS? Is it as simple as shucking the drive and installing in the DAS? I've also read that setting up RAID will wipe the drives; will it be necessary to buy a third 12TB drive before moving my media?

Because I think that is the only motherboard that has more than one or two PCIe slots. But Threadripper is overkill expensive for just storage and not worth it. I didn't do research on Intel side.      Build#2: Get a server motherboard with lots of SATA ports and lots of SATA to M.2 adapters. Put the NVMe's in, and connect them to SATA ports. But you don't like cables.      Build#3: Get a LattePanda Mu based on Intel N100 which they advertise a NAS carrier but I don't know if it exists yet or not.

I have been doing this for years but lately I've been trying to streamline and speed up the process.      I have a SATA dock installed inside my system (straight SATA, no USB), and when I slot in my old 1TB Crucial MX500 drive, I can run the macrium backup in about 6 minutes.      I have lots of spare NVMe drives, so I got one of these Orico 10Gbps USB 3.2 NVMe enclosures (https://www.amazon.com/ORICO-NVMe-Thunderbolt-Compatible-SSDs-PWM2-BK/dp/B0BJ23JTXX) several months ago and it has worked fine for transferring files. However, when I run the same macrium backup as before to this NVMe drive it seems to hang for a second, then shows an estimate of 6 minutes, then within a few seconds the transfer rate drops from 1+gbps to under 100mbps and the estimated time shoots up to 55 minutes.      You would think that the symptoms point to a crappy USB enclosure or a problem with the drive... but when I copy the same image file directly from the SATA drive to the NVMe drive manually in Windows the transfer rate is pegged at over 550MB\sec (megabytes) and it is done in just over a minute.      Is there something I can adjust in Macrium or elsewhere that would fix this seeming incompatibility with this NVMe USB enclosure? I'd love to use it (to free up my old 1TB MX500) but having to wait nearly 10 times as long for backups is unacceptable.

The functionality in specific that I'm looking for is the ability to create users that can then establish a two way sync with the server, but similar to with Qsync, there would ideally be a smart sync that would only download what users actually need locally and not anything that isn't necessary to their work so they're not having to deal with terabytes of storage being synced.

When building this I didn't realize how hard it would be to find a tool for this, and everything I've found just isn't very useful. Syncthing is not helpful, its not smart and would require everyone mirror 20tb of files (unless im misunderstanding what it does.) SMB sharing technically works but is too slow for people to work off of for our purposes as our files have huge datarates (multilayer EXR sequences, 1gb a frame kind of stuff).  I'm also experimenting with Google Workspace to see if that works any better for this but I'd figure I'd ask for help before I go down that road.      If any of you have any experience with this or could maybe point me to a client-side software that can manage client side downloads from the server in a smart way like Qsync that would be amazing.</Content></post><post><Title>Need recommendations for USB3 or eSata external drive to connect to router for FTP server.</Title><Author>u/mufasis</Author><Content>What’s going on data hoarders.

Want to upgrade storage and reasonably future-proof as best as possible. Considering changing my setup from PC (Plex Media Server) + external HDD (media storage), to a mini PC (Plex) + DAS. Could use advice.    Hi, I've done some research on upgrading my current Plex / general media storage setup and I've come up with a plan that looks something like the below. Please share any constructive criticisms, tips, things I might have overlooked, etc. I want to do this right the first time around.      Use case: 1-2 simultaneous 1080p streams, most clients will be able to directly play my mostly HEVC (h.265) content without needing to transcode. Not all, though, so transcoding option is nice. I have Plex Pass so HW transcoding is also an option.      My current setup:      PC [Plex Media Server]    External Hard drive (12TB) [~10TB personal media]      What I'm thinking of moving to:      Mini PC (Beelink Mini S12) [Plex Media Server]    DAS (4-bay QNAP)      3.5 12TB HDD (shuck my current drive) [~10TB personal media]      3.5 12TB HDD (buy a new one) [RAID backup?]      empty (add a 12TB in future for more storage?)      empty (add a 12TB in future for more storage?)      If this looks good, I have a bonus question: How do I safely move my content on my current 12TB external hard drive to the DAS? Is it as simple as shucking the drive and installing in the DAS? I've also read that setting up RAID will wipe the drives; will it be necessary to buy a third 12TB drive before moving my media?      Thanks in advance!</Content></post><post><Title>NVMe SSD based storage computer</Title><Author>u/aes100</Author><Content>If you were to build a storage computer based on NVMe SSDs, how would you do it? Nor datarate, nor storage space is priority. Just sheer number of NVMe SSDs... and you hate cables.      Build#1: AMD Threadripper with PCIe to M.2 adapter cards. Because I think that is the only motherboard that has more than one or two PCIe slots. But Threadripper is overkill expensive for just storage and not worth it. I didn't do research on Intel side.      Build#2: Get a server motherboard with lots of SATA ports and lots of SATA to M.2 adapters. Put the NVMe's in, and connect them to SATA ports. But you don't like cables.      Build#3: Get a LattePanda Mu based on Intel N100 which they advertise a NAS carrier but I don't know if it exists yet or not. Or get a FriendlyELEC CM3588 based on Rockchip. You are free of cables, but are you gonna regret accessing the data on there because it is slow? Or is it actually fast enough to, I don't know, watch a video from it?      What do you think about the above builds? What downs and ups do you think they have? How would you do it?

I have been doing this for years but lately I've been trying to streamline and speed up the process.      I have a SATA dock installed inside my system (straight SATA, no USB), and when I slot in my old 1TB Crucial MX500 drive, I can run the macrium backup in about 6 minutes.      I have lots of spare NVMe drives, so I got one of these Orico 10Gbps USB 3.2 NVMe enclosures (https://www.amazon.com/ORICO-NVMe-Thunderbolt-Compatible-SSDs-PWM2-BK/dp/B0BJ23JTXX) several months ago and it has worked fine for transferring files. However, when I run the same macrium backup as before to this NVMe drive it seems to hang for a second, then shows an estimate of 6 minutes, then within a few seconds the transfer rate drops from 1+gbps to under 100mbps and the estimated time shoots up to 55 minutes.      You would think that the symptoms point to a crappy USB enclosure or a problem with the drive... but when I copy the same image file directly from the SATA drive to the NVMe drive manually in Windows the transfer rate is pegged at over 550MB\sec (megabytes) and it is done in just over a minute.      Is there something I can adjust in Macrium or elsewhere that would fix this seeming incompatibility with this NVMe USB enclosure? I'd love to use it (to free up my old 1TB MX500) but having to wait nearly 10 times as long for backups is unacceptable.

SMB sharing technically works but is too slow for people to work off of for our purposes as our files have huge datarates (multilayer EXR sequences, 1gb a frame kind of stuff).  I'm also experimenting with Google Workspace to see if that works any better for this but I'd figure I'd ask for help before I go down that road.      If any of you have any experience with this or could maybe point me to a client-side software that can manage client side downloads from the server in a smart way like Qsync that would be amazing.</Content></post><post><Title>Need recommendations for USB3 or eSata external drive to connect to router for FTP server.</Title><Author>u/mufasis</Author><Content>What’s going on data hoarders.

Want to upgrade storage and reasonably future-proof as best as possible. Considering changing my setup from PC (Plex Media Server) + external HDD (media storage), to a mini PC (Plex) + DAS. Could use advice.    Hi, I've done some research on upgrading my current Plex / general media storage setup and I've come up with a plan that looks something like the below. Please share any constructive criticisms, tips, things I might have overlooked, etc. I want to do this right the first time around.      Use case: 1-2 simultaneous 1080p streams, most clients will be able to directly play my mostly HEVC (h.265) content without needing to transcode. Not all, though, so transcoding option is nice. I have Plex Pass so HW transcoding is also an option.      My current setup:      PC [Plex Media Server]    External Hard drive (12TB) [~10TB personal media]      What I'm thinking of moving to:      Mini PC (Beelink Mini S12) [Plex Media Server]    DAS (4-bay QNAP)      3.5 12TB HDD (shuck my current drive) [~10TB personal media]      3.5 12TB HDD (buy a new one) [RAID backup?]      empty (add a 12TB in future for more storage?)      empty (add a 12TB in future for more storage?)      If this looks good, I have a bonus question: How do I safely move my content on my current 12TB external hard drive to the DAS? Is it as simple as shucking the drive and installing in the DAS? I've also read that setting up RAID will wipe the drives; will it be necessary to buy a third 12TB drive before moving my media?

I have been doing this for years but lately I've been trying to streamline and speed up the process.      I have a SATA dock installed inside my system (straight SATA, no USB), and when I slot in my old 1TB Crucial MX500 drive, I can run the macrium backup in about 6 minutes.      I have lots of spare NVMe drives, so I got one of these Orico 10Gbps USB 3.2 NVMe enclosures (https://www.amazon.com/ORICO-NVMe-Thunderbolt-Compatible-SSDs-PWM2-BK/dp/B0BJ23JTXX) several months ago and it has worked fine for transferring files. However, when I run the same macrium backup as before to this NVMe drive it seems to hang for a second, then shows an estimate of 6 minutes, then within a few seconds the transfer rate drops from 1+gbps to under 100mbps and the estimated time shoots up to 55 minutes.      You would think that the symptoms point to a crappy USB enclosure or a problem with the drive... but when I copy the same image file directly from the SATA drive to the NVMe drive manually in Windows the transfer rate is pegged at over 550MB\sec (megabytes) and it is done in just over a minute.      Is there something I can adjust in Macrium or elsewhere that would fix this seeming incompatibility with this NVMe USB enclosure? I'd love to use it (to free up my old 1TB MX500) but having to wait nearly 10 times as long for backups is unacceptable.

The problem is they seem to be of varying quality almost like shucking a drive. Sometimes they're totally new, sometimes unused old stock and sometimes manufacturer refurbished.      My brother got a years old stock that had zero on power hours.      However, a review of the seller suggested the following methodology. They were reviewing a 12TB Exos      "According to my tests, this drive is legit. I was able to:      Verify the serial number at the Seagate website-  - - -    - Format the drive into 11 partitions.      Put files into the first and last 2 partitions and was able to read back the files.      Note that the drive has 11,175.98 GB of actual free space. The missing 825 GB may have been allocated to the file mapping table."      Why do you need to partition it n-1 TB times then write data on the first and last partition? Is this even sound? I think they suggested it because it's quicker and more painless than stress testing the whole drive for a legitimacy test.      EDIT. I want to clarify I know the scam of declaring high capacities using a smaller capacity medium. Also most of these drives usually have valid warranties just in a different region when checked via the their respective manufacturers website even the refurbished ones.</Content></post><post><Title>Transport 3.5" HDD with tray weekly in small casing - can't re-use packaging forever</Title><Author>u/No-Balance-8038</Author><Content>I want basically a similar small case that allows for a 3.5" with tray which is 17cm long, but as small and portable!

Expert advice needed 🫠</Title><Author>u/Positive_Minds</Author><Content>This 4TB drive and also my 10 year old 2TB HGST drive. have popped up bad and weak sectors , they haven’t been switched on in 10 years ..      So was this basically my fault for not powering them up every and using disk fresh etc or is it just a case of age related demagnetisation or mechanical failure ? I just don’t get as most of my 10 year old western digital drives or seagate have been fine when tested after 10 years      I’m seriously thinking of doing yearly refreshes of my drives from now on .. My other question is can the weak sectors be reallocated or removed ?      I read this on super user , is this true ?      In order to keep the data signal from fading, you need to re-write the data. This is often known as “hard disk maintenance”, and should be done 3 or 4 times a year. While it does not prevent data from being corrupted or deleted, it can go a long way towards ensuring that the magnetic signal does not fade away completely. The way it works is to read every sector of the drive, and then re-write the data found there, provided the drive reported no errors. If this is done on a regular basis, the magnetic signal of every part of the drive will be refreshed long before the signal fades or becomes ambiguous. This technique also gives the drive controller the opportunity to decide whether to retire any sectors that are becoming too unreliable, before any important data is lost.      Magnetic Field Breakdown      Most sources state that permanent magnets lose their magnetic field strength at a rate of 1% per year. Assuming this is valid, after ~69 years, we can assume that half of the sectors in a hard drive would be corrupted (since they all lost half of their strength by this time). Obviously, this is quite a long time, but this risk is easily mitigated - simply re-write the data to the drive. How frequently you need to do this depends on the following two issues (I also go over this in my conclusion).      To periodically refresh the data on the drive, simply transfer it to another location, and re-writing it back to the drive. That way, the magnetic domains in the physical disk surface will be renewed with their original strength (because you just re-wrote the files back to the disk). If you're concerned about filesystem corruption, you can also format the disk before transferring the data back.      You can also help to avoid this issue by archiving your data with recovery data and error correction when you put the data onto the drive. Many archive formats support the inclusion of data recovery algorithms, so even if you have a few corrupted sectors, you can still re-build the lost data.      Depending on the priority of the data you've stored, you may want to refresh the hard disk more often. If it is essential data, I would recommend no less then 2 years at maximum. If you can withstand some chance of minor data loss (e.g. a few corrupted sectors here and there), go with 5 years. It doesn't take long to copy the data off the drive, and copy it back.      One thing not considered is the servo tracks and markings. These are written one time at the factory and never again (on modern disks). No amount of re-writes by the user or so-called low-level formatting freshens these. Once they fade, they fade!      It's different with the first stepper motor disks of the 80's. They don't have servo tracks and a low-level format writes ALL of the bits - fresh.</Content></post><post><Title>How unlimited is Flickr Pro?</Title><Author>u/jammsession</Author><Content>A friend of mine is a photographer.

I have about 50 channels I am downloading videos from manually and it's so tiring I stopped for a year. I started again and found a lot of channels deleted videos or the channel is closed. And some of the channels have since uploaded thousands of videos.      I used to manually go on youtube on my pc and grab the links but it stops loading after 1000 videos or it overloaded the chrome and crash. Would a channel downloader be able to download thousands of videos from one channel?      How does the leading youtube downloaders know which videos were has been downloaded so that it doesn't download it again?      Which program allows me to select preferred codec for a specific resolution?

I want to build a nas to store my digital library and stream it to my and my family's devices. Currently relying on 5 external 2.5" drives and windows media share.

Undevolt the fx4100 to the lowest it can go. Diy mod my Asus Vento a8 PC case for cooling and dust prevention. Buy a 16-20 TB drive and start the nas. Once I can afford a second drive i plan on using them in raid 1. Once a 3rd drive is added I want to use them in raid 5.

I admit i don't have much experience in video manipulation but this is turning out to be exceptionally hard.      I have around 5 movies which have 5 vob files each. The movies are around 4 hours long but around 12gb in size for barely 704x570p so i would love to concatinate and compress them.      Now here's the problem, none of the video editor software is picking up the subtitles, not handbrake, not even ffmpeg but mpv somehow plays with the subtitles, though it takes mpv 10ish seconds to load the subtitles (weird ik).      Now if i join 5 of the files to make 1 complete movie using ffmpeg, the subtitles stop loading.

However people online had also mentioned CCC and I'm unsure how that works? I was also hoping to back this all up to a portable HDD but it seems that 8TB HDDs can only be plugged in is that true?

I was trying to find a python script to automate it, cuz it will take me forever going one by one on tens of thousands of images, but I can't seem to find one that can archive this sort of website. It only goes by pages of 9 and the thumbnail images are shrunk down a ton so you have to click on the image twice to open the full size. Luckily it seems like every thumbnail image shares a name with the source image, but with an added suffix of the preview size, so I imagine it would be possible to have the script delete the underscore and re-add the .jpeg extension. As for going through pages, I'm not so sure on, but if I can input a list of URLs and just batch copy the original URL adding every page number (I know how to do this without a script), I could just use that.      I was only going to download AKB48 related images, because most of these images aren't available anywhere else online, and soon won't be anywhere period. They're all old and thus fairly small, so I'm not too worried about it taking a long time to download.      If anyone can direct me to a script that can do this or has some other mass image downloading method you're aware of, please let me know.

You plug in a memory card (not specifically Sony Memory Stick. I mean like Compact Flash, SD Card, and so on), press a button, and it copies your card to a folder on the hard drive.      But that think is old and low capacity and I probably can't upgrade the hard drive due to the form factor and firmware likely only allowing 80gb drives.      Anyway, anyone know of a similar device that is more modern?  I want it to:      be portable and battery powered (nothing huge and nothing that needs to be plugged in to work)      have a large SSD (500 GB or more)      be self sustained (I don't want to have to plug it into a PC nor Bluetooth it to my phone)      accept at least SD cards (more slots would be nice, but not necessary)      I mainly want to do it to easily hoard pictures off my camera, especially if I need to quickly empty out my more expensive fast cards      Also, a link to show what I already have. I'm not the one selling it and I don't recommend buying it because it's so outdated and slow (and the battery probably doesn't work considering how old it is).

They're 14tb drives, currently containing ~4.7TB of data.      I'd like to, ideally I think, keep the two drives/filesystems in sync over the internet, probably through Tailscale so no public exposure necessary. At the very least I'd like to have a solid, relatively up to date backup of all of the data that lives on the drive at my brother's house, backing up that of the one at house.      What are my best options for doing so, and, if it were you, how would you go about setting things up?      I'm thinking maybe btrfs snapshots over ssh using btrbkup (both drives are formatted using btrfs) is probably me best bet, but I've never used snapshots and not sure how easy it would be configure in this case. This would, of course, depend on the drives both being btrfs formatted, which I suppose okay, although I was also thinking maybe it's smarter to have just regular backups that are filesystem agnostic.      My favorite straight backup tool these days is Kopia, so if I were to go the second route I'd probably be looking at using that, although I'm not opposed to going restic. The only problem with that is that I think Kopia can only backup to either an S3-compatible bucket (so maybe run minio on secondary sysem?), or through webDAV which I'd have to figure out how to configure on the machine at my brother's house, or to the local filesystem, in which case I could maybe mount the remote disk on the local machine at my place using sshfs, but that may introduce weirdness, or just be a bit too unstable.      What would you do in a situation like mine? Do you have any experience in setting something like this scenario up and what potential pitfalls would you anticipate?      Thank you for reading the somewhat lengthy post,      I look forward to any insights.

The problem is they seem to be of varying quality almost like shucking a drive. Sometimes they're totally new, sometimes unused old stock and sometimes manufacturer refurbished.      My brother got a years old stock that had zero on power hours.      However, a review of the seller suggested the following methodology. They were reviewing a 12TB Exos      "According to my tests, this drive is legit. I was able to:      Verify the serial number at the Seagate website-  - - -    - Format the drive into 11 partitions.      Put files into the first and last 2 partitions and was able to read back the files.      Note that the drive has 11,175.98 GB of actual free space. The missing 825 GB may have been allocated to the file mapping table."      Why do you need to partition it n-1 TB times then write data on the first and last partition? Is this even sound? I think they suggested it because it's quicker and more painless than stress testing the whole drive for a legitimacy test.      EDIT. I want to clarify I know the scam of declaring high capacities using a smaller capacity medium. Also most of these drives usually have valid warranties just in a different region when checked via the their respective manufacturers website even the refurbished ones.</Content></post><post><Title>Transport 3.5" HDD with tray weekly in small casing - can't re-use packaging forever</Title><Author>u/No-Balance-8038</Author><Content>I want basically a similar small case that allows for a 3.5" with tray which is 17cm long, but as small and portable!

Expert advice needed 🫠</Title><Author>u/Positive_Minds</Author><Content>This 4TB drive and also my 10 year old 2TB HGST drive. have popped up bad and weak sectors , they haven’t been switched on in 10 years ..      So was this basically my fault for not powering them up every and using disk fresh etc or is it just a case of age related demagnetisation or mechanical failure ? I just don’t get as most of my 10 year old western digital drives or seagate have been fine when tested after 10 years      I’m seriously thinking of doing yearly refreshes of my drives from now on .. My other question is can the weak sectors be reallocated or removed ?      I read this on super user , is this true ?      In order to keep the data signal from fading, you need to re-write the data. This is often known as “hard disk maintenance”, and should be done 3 or 4 times a year. While it does not prevent data from being corrupted or deleted, it can go a long way towards ensuring that the magnetic signal does not fade away completely. The way it works is to read every sector of the drive, and then re-write the data found there, provided the drive reported no errors. If this is done on a regular basis, the magnetic signal of every part of the drive will be refreshed long before the signal fades or becomes ambiguous. This technique also gives the drive controller the opportunity to decide whether to retire any sectors that are becoming too unreliable, before any important data is lost.      Magnetic Field Breakdown      Most sources state that permanent magnets lose their magnetic field strength at a rate of 1% per year. Assuming this is valid, after ~69 years, we can assume that half of the sectors in a hard drive would be corrupted (since they all lost half of their strength by this time). Obviously, this is quite a long time, but this risk is easily mitigated - simply re-write the data to the drive. How frequently you need to do this depends on the following two issues (I also go over this in my conclusion).      To periodically refresh the data on the drive, simply transfer it to another location, and re-writing it back to the drive. That way, the magnetic domains in the physical disk surface will be renewed with their original strength (because you just re-wrote the files back to the disk). If you're concerned about filesystem corruption, you can also format the disk before transferring the data back.      You can also help to avoid this issue by archiving your data with recovery data and error correction when you put the data onto the drive. Many archive formats support the inclusion of data recovery algorithms, so even if you have a few corrupted sectors, you can still re-build the lost data.      Depending on the priority of the data you've stored, you may want to refresh the hard disk more often. If it is essential data, I would recommend no less then 2 years at maximum. If you can withstand some chance of minor data loss (e.g. a few corrupted sectors here and there), go with 5 years. It doesn't take long to copy the data off the drive, and copy it back.      One thing not considered is the servo tracks and markings. These are written one time at the factory and never again (on modern disks). No amount of re-writes by the user or so-called low-level formatting freshens these. Once they fade, they fade!      It's different with the first stepper motor disks of the 80's. They don't have servo tracks and a low-level format writes ALL of the bits - fresh.</Content></post><post><Title>How unlimited is Flickr Pro?</Title><Author>u/jammsession</Author><Content>A friend of mine is a photographer.

I have about 50 channels I am downloading videos from manually and it's so tiring I stopped for a year. I started again and found a lot of channels deleted videos or the channel is closed. And some of the channels have since uploaded thousands of videos.      I used to manually go on youtube on my pc and grab the links but it stops loading after 1000 videos or it overloaded the chrome and crash. Would a channel downloader be able to download thousands of videos from one channel?      How does the leading youtube downloaders know which videos were has been downloaded so that it doesn't download it again?      Which program allows me to select preferred codec for a specific resolution?      If it is possible I want to avoid av1 codec because my tablet can't play it unless it's 8k because youtube uses only av1 on 8k resolution, I would play it on my pc when I upgrade my video card black friday.</Content></post><post><Title>Dreams and Aspirations</Title><Author>u/thenazgul80</Author><Content>Do I have this right? I want to build a nas to store my digital library and stream it to my and my family's devices. Currently relying on 5 external 2.5" drives and windows media share. However I can't outright purchase something like a Synology nas due to cost. I have my old PC collecting dust. Amd fx 4100 Radeon 7700hd and 8 gb of ddr3 ram. Here is the plan. Undevolt the fx4100 to the lowest it can go. Diy mod my Asus Vento a8 PC case for cooling and dust prevention. Buy a 16-20 TB drive and start the nas. Once I can afford a second drive i plan on using them in raid 1. Once a 3rd drive is added I want to use them in raid 5. Over all I want to end up with 40-60tb of useable storage with some redundancy and keep the external 2.5" drives for backups. From what I can gather, truenas won't let me just add drives later on down the line. Is unRAID my only option if I want to start with the bare minimum and expand later on as I can afford more drives?</Content></post><post><Title>Need help with converting and compressing old VOB files</Title><Author>u/martian_doggo</Author><Content>So i have a bunch of old vob files, and i want to convert them to mkv or mp4 or something. I admit i don't have much experience in video manipulation but this is turning out to be exceptionally hard.      I have around 5 movies which have 5 vob files each. The movies are around 4 hours long but around 12gb in size for barely 704x570p so i would love to concatinate and compress them.      Now here's the problem, none of the video editor software is picking up the subtitles, not handbrake, not even ffmpeg but mpv somehow plays with the subtitles, though it takes mpv 10ish seconds to load the subtitles (weird ik).      Now if i join 5 of the files to make 1 complete movie using ffmpeg, the subtitles stop loading.      I have no idea what to do :(      thanks</Content></post><post><Title>Backing up MacBook and multiple SSDs to single HDD</Title><Author>u/cloudfortynine</Author><Content>Hi everyone,      I could use some guidance as I'm unsure what the simplest and low maintenance solution is for me.

However people online had also mentioned CCC and I'm unsure how that works? I was also hoping to back this all up to a portable HDD but it seems that 8TB HDDs can only be plugged in is that true? I'm not interested in NAS etc. as this is too complicated and expensive for me.      As a sidetone I'm also planning on backing up to BackBlaze as well.

I was trying to find a python script to automate it, cuz it will take me forever going one by one on tens of thousands of images, but I can't seem to find one that can archive this sort of website. It only goes by pages of 9 and the thumbnail images are shrunk down a ton so you have to click on the image twice to open the full size. Luckily it seems like every thumbnail image shares a name with the source image, but with an added suffix of the preview size, so I imagine it would be possible to have the script delete the underscore and re-add the .jpeg extension. As for going through pages, I'm not so sure on, but if I can input a list of URLs and just batch copy the original URL adding every page number (I know how to do this without a script), I could just use that.      I was only going to download AKB48 related images, because most of these images aren't available anywhere else online, and soon won't be anywhere period. They're all old and thus fairly small, so I'm not too worried about it taking a long time to download.      If anyone can direct me to a script that can do this or has some other mass image downloading method you're aware of, please let me know.

And how do I actually find those deals      Are Seagate drives really that bad?      What is the general consensus on buying drives second hand off eBay or through a liquidation auction? Bad idea or risky at best?      I'm assuming Facebook marketplace/Craigslist should be avoided, but is there any merit in looking there? Like if I find a second hand external I could shuck?      How important are RPMs sata type and all that other non capacity info? What's good and what's bad? Tradeoffs?      How long will a healthy high capacity drive realistically last?

You plug in a memory card (not specifically Sony Memory Stick. I mean like Compact Flash, SD Card, and so on), press a button, and it copies your card to a folder on the hard drive.      But that think is old and low capacity and I probably can't upgrade the hard drive due to the form factor and firmware likely only allowing 80gb drives.      Anyway, anyone know of a similar device that is more modern?  I want it to:      be portable and battery powered (nothing huge and nothing that needs to be plugged in to work)      have a large SSD (500 GB or more)      be self sustained (I don't want to have to plug it into a PC nor Bluetooth it to my phone)      accept at least SD cards (more slots would be nice, but not necessary)      I mainly want to do it to easily hoard pictures off my camera, especially if I need to quickly empty out my more expensive fast cards      Also, a link to show what I already have. I'm not the one selling it and I don't recommend buying it because it's so outdated and slow (and the battery probably doesn't work considering how old it is).

They're 14tb drives, currently containing ~4.7TB of data.      I'd like to, ideally I think, keep the two drives/filesystems in sync over the internet, probably through Tailscale so no public exposure necessary. At the very least I'd like to have a solid, relatively up to date backup of all of the data that lives on the drive at my brother's house, backing up that of the one at house.      What are my best options for doing so, and, if it were you, how would you go about setting things up?      I'm thinking maybe btrfs snapshots over ssh using btrbkup (both drives are formatted using btrfs) is probably me best bet, but I've never used snapshots and not sure how easy it would be configure in this case. This would, of course, depend on the drives both being btrfs formatted, which I suppose okay, although I was also thinking maybe it's smarter to have just regular backups that are filesystem agnostic.      My favorite straight backup tool these days is Kopia, so if I were to go the second route I'd probably be looking at using that, although I'm not opposed to going restic. The only problem with that is that I think Kopia can only backup to either an S3-compatible bucket (so maybe run minio on secondary sysem?), or through webDAV which I'd have to figure out how to configure on the machine at my brother's house, or to the local filesystem, in which case I could maybe mount the remote disk on the local machine at my place using sshfs, but that may introduce weirdness, or just be a bit too unstable.      What would you do in a situation like mine? Do you have any experience in setting something like this scenario up and what potential pitfalls would you anticipate?      Thank you for reading the somewhat lengthy post,      I look forward to any insights.

Here’s the gist of my idea:      The Concept  •High-Speed Piezoelectric Module: Use piezoelectric crystals that can oscillate at frequencies in the gigahertz range as an ultra-fast data buffer. This could potentially give us read and write speeds way beyond what we have with current tech.•Main 3D NAND Storage: Use 3D NAND for the main long-term storage. We all know it’s reliable and has a high capacity.    How It Would Work  1.Writing Data: Incoming data would first go to the piezoelectric module at super high speeds.2.Transferring Data: The data would then be transferred to the main 3D NAND storage for long-term keeping.3.Reading Data: For reads, the system would first check the piezoelectric buffer for quick access. If the data isn’t there, it would pull from the 3D NAND storage.    Benefits  •Speed: This setup could drastically reduce latency and boost read/write speeds.•Energy Efficiency: Piezoelectric materials might be more energy-efficient for rapid operations.•New Storage Architecture: Combining the speed of piezoelectrics with the capacity of 3D NAND could create a super-efficient storage solution.    Challenges  •Tech Integration: Making sure the piezoelectric and 3D NAND components work seamlessly together.•Cost: High-quality piezoelectric materials and the complexity of this setup might be pricey.•Durability and Reliability: The materials need to handle high-frequency oscillations over long periods without wearing out.    Potential Impact      If we can make this work, it could be a game-changer for data centers, mobile devices, and industrial applications that need ultra-fast response times.      What do you all think? Could this actually work?</Content></post><post><Title>help with a complicated wget string : how do -A and -R args stack, and is there any means of boolean filtering ?</Title><Author>u/ImaginaryCheetah</Author><Content>good afternoon,      i'm not particularly familiar with wget so i'm asking the experts for assistance...      my current string of wget -A "*(USA)*zip" -R -m -p -E -k -K -np -nd -w 2 https://target works fine to pull all files with "(USA)" included in the name, but i'd like to understand if i can get more complicated.      does the -R arg work in conjunction with -A or would it override ?      for example, wget -A "*(USA)*zip" -R "*(Demo)*" [etc] would this return all files with "(USA)" in the title unless it also had "(Demo)" in the file name ?      is there any way of passing a boolean criteria through wget ?

Assume both of these scenarios are basic setups without drive pools or raid.      The redditor suggests and recommends that using a single SSD with a partition for the OS and Data drive is more safe than using dual drives.      I believe using a partitioned SSD will both double your chances of drive failure due to writes and reads, and it will make it a pain in the ass to restore the backup.      I suggested using two separate SSDs, and the redditor said that this indeed doubles the chances of drive failure due to two drives. I disagreed and said that it halves it due to the decreased reads and writes. I also suggested that dual drives will make it easier to restore a backup drive if one fails.

I'm running Linux and using mdadm to run 3 arrays.      Before I attached any of my drives with data and arrays configured, I installed the card with no drives attached and update the firmware to 16.00.12.00, and made sure it was in IT mode.  As a test I then connected one of my arrays to the controller and booted the system.  After booting up, the drives were detected fine (4 x 2TB) but the array was gone.  It appears that the metadata was erased, mdadm didn't recognize any drive as being part of an array.      I was able to recover the data and the array by following the steps here:  https://raid.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/Recovering_a_damaged_RAID    However, if I reboot again the same thing happens, the metadata is lost and mdadm does not recognize that the drives are part of an array.   I do not have this issue with the older LSI controllers.      Any idea what's going on here?  When I created the array I used the entre drive, so I did not create a Linux RAID partition on each drive.  The array is configured using /dev/sda to /dev/sdd, and not /dev/sda1 to /dev/sdd1.  Not sure that has anything to do with it.      Edit:  Seems to be an issue with the controller and GPT partition tables.  As a test, I created an array with a couple 120gb SSD's I had laying around.  I created the array with the whole drive, rebooted, and after a reboot the array was still present.  I realized my other drives are configured as GPT.  So I wiped the SSDs, switched them to GPT and again created the array.  This time after a reboot the array was gone, mdadm does not recognize the drives as being part of an array.  Not sure how to fix this.</Content></post><post><Title>Official Giveaway: June 2024 Seagate IronWolf Pro 16TB Hard Drive Giveaway</Title><Author>u/Seagate_Surfer</Author><Content>Hi r/DataHoarder crowd!

Here’s the gist of my idea:      The Concept  •High-Speed Piezoelectric Module: Use piezoelectric crystals that can oscillate at frequencies in the gigahertz range as an ultra-fast data buffer. This could potentially give us read and write speeds way beyond what we have with current tech.•Main 3D NAND Storage: Use 3D NAND for the main long-term storage. We all know it’s reliable and has a high capacity.    How It Would Work  1.Writing Data: Incoming data would first go to the piezoelectric module at super high speeds.2.Transferring Data: The data would then be transferred to the main 3D NAND storage for long-term keeping.3.Reading Data: For reads, the system would first check the piezoelectric buffer for quick access. If the data isn’t there, it would pull from the 3D NAND storage.    Benefits  •Speed: This setup could drastically reduce latency and boost read/write speeds.•Energy Efficiency: Piezoelectric materials might be more energy-efficient for rapid operations.•New Storage Architecture: Combining the speed of piezoelectrics with the capacity of 3D NAND could create a super-efficient storage solution.    Challenges  •Tech Integration: Making sure the piezoelectric and 3D NAND components work seamlessly together.•Cost: High-quality piezoelectric materials and the complexity of this setup might be pricey.•Durability and Reliability: The materials need to handle high-frequency oscillations over long periods without wearing out.    Potential Impact      If we can make this work, it could be a game-changer for data centers, mobile devices, and industrial applications that need ultra-fast response times.      What do you all think? Could this actually work?</Content></post><post><Title>help with a complicated wget string : how do -A and -R args stack, and is there any means of boolean filtering ?</Title><Author>u/ImaginaryCheetah</Author><Content>good afternoon,      i'm not particularly familiar with wget so i'm asking the experts for assistance...      my current string of wget -A "*(USA)*zip" -R -m -p -E -k -K -np -nd -w 2 https://target works fine to pull all files with "(USA)" included in the name, but i'd like to understand if i can get more complicated.      does the -R arg work in conjunction with -A or would it override ?      for example, wget -A "*(USA)*zip" -R "*(Demo)*" [etc] would this return all files with "(USA)" in the title unless it also had "(Demo)" in the file name ?      is there any way of passing a boolean criteria through wget ?

Assume both of these scenarios are basic setups without drive pools or raid.      The redditor suggests and recommends that using a single SSD with a partition for the OS and Data drive is more safe than using dual drives.      I believe using a partitioned SSD will both double your chances of drive failure due to writes and reads, and it will make it a pain in the ass to restore the backup.      I suggested using two separate SSDs, and the redditor said that this indeed doubles the chances of drive failure due to two drives. I disagreed and said that it halves it due to the decreased reads and writes. I also suggested that dual drives will make it easier to restore a backup drive if one fails.      Which scenario is better?      In both scenerios there are backups, like a mirrored drive using Acronis disk imager or something like that.

They then send me a nonfunctional drive. I now have to go through the process of RMAing the RMA drive, and the kicker? I have to pay the return shipping on the drive that failed and the broken drive they sent me.      So as the title asks, are there any other companies I should be spending my dollars with going forward?      Edit: In case it wasn’t clear.

I'm running Linux and using mdadm to run 3 arrays.      Before I attached any of my drives with data and arrays configured, I installed the card with no drives attached and update the firmware to 16.00.12.00, and made sure it was in IT mode.  As a test I then connected one of my arrays to the controller and booted the system.  After booting up, the drives were detected fine (4 x 2TB) but the array was gone.  It appears that the metadata was erased, mdadm didn't recognize any drive as being part of an array.      I was able to recover the data and the array by following the steps here:  https://raid.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/Recovering_a_damaged_RAID    However, if I reboot again the same thing happens, the metadata is lost and mdadm does not recognize that the drives are part of an array.   I do not have this issue with the older LSI controllers.      Any idea what's going on here?  When I created the array I used the entre drive, so I did not create a Linux RAID partition on each drive.  The array is configured using /dev/sda to /dev/sdd, and not /dev/sda1 to /dev/sdd1.  Not sure that has anything to do with it.      Edit:  Seems to be an issue with the controller and GPT partition tables.  As a test, I created an array with a couple 120gb SSD's I had laying around.  I created the array with the whole drive, rebooted, and after a reboot the array was still present.  I realized my other drives are configured as GPT.  So I wiped the SSDs, switched them to GPT and again created the array.  This time after a reboot the array was gone, mdadm does not recognize the drives as being part of an array.  Not sure how to fix this.</Content></post><post><Title>Official Giveaway: June 2024 Seagate IronWolf Pro 16TB Hard Drive Giveaway</Title><Author>u/Seagate_Surfer</Author><Content>Hi r/DataHoarder crowd!

When I first started my server I only had 1 4TB drive, but I quickly outgrew that. The drive mode is set as JBOD “one drive”. I have another 4TB drive that I want to put in my NAS, but when I go in to change the RAID mode, I get warnings saying that all data will be lost. I know my only RAID options are 0 and 1. I believe I can also use JBOD as well with two drives? I’m not worried about redundancy as I can easily redownload content but would not like to have my drives erased just to add another drive. What would be the best way to move forward?</Content></post><post><Title>How much damage have I caused from leaving a HDD in the sun?</Title><Author>u/JerichoBlows</Author><Content>I ordered a refurbished 12TB Seagate Enterprise HDD and it was delivered today while I wasn't home. It was over +100°F (+38°C) degrees today and the sun was beaming directly on the mailbox for 4 hours before I got to it. I suspected the box could have easily been 130°F (55°C) or possibly much hotter having been in the direct sunlight for so long. I immediately put the entire box in the refrigerator. After about 5 minutes in the fridge, I decided to measure the temp using a digital BBQ thermometer. It measured at 104°F (40°C) but this was likely not accurate because I was using a thermometer that is meant to be shoved inside of meat and the box had already been in the fridge for 5 mins.      How much damage could have been caused from it sitting in the direct +100°F (+38°C) degree sunlight for just over 4 hours?

I had some extra PSUs and fans and supermicro trays so I figured why not design around that. I've probably put no less than 40+ hours into design, print, redesign, print, try fitment etc. Not the most experience with Fusion360 or CAD in general. The front LEDs do light up during activity :). I've been thinking of expanding this into a mATX or Mini-ITX supported case as well.      I know this is also pretty much on the heals of shaztech_info but I think we have enough differences between us and I was kinda shocked to see someone else coming out with a similar idea around the same time lol. Let me know what you fellas and fellettes think!      From Makerworld:      I was unable to find a product that met my specifications of 8 hot-swap bays, a SAS backplane and external SAS connectors for easy connectivity, so I decided to design and build my own 8-bay Direct Attached Storage (DAS). This DAS features a Supermicro SAS833TQ backplane with Gen 5.5 hot-swap 3.5" trays. It is powered by either a 200W PWS-203-1H (as-shown) or a 350W PWS-351-1H (or similar units of the same dimensions: PWS-351-1H 100 x 40 x 220mm, PWS-203-1H 76 x 40.3 x 192mm) power supply. Additionally, it includes an external SAS SFF-8088 to SFF-8087 adapter to cut down on internal wires.      I printed this on my X1C and have realized that making it available for smaller print beds should also be done instead of 1 large single print.      The body is 255 W x 190 H x 245mm D, it is printed as a single print, no supports needed. The body at 10% infill, 2 walls with gyroid infill .20mm layer height with a 0.4mm nozzle. This print requires NO supports to print. The print of the body will use approximately 984.5g of filament if no painting is done of the logo or numbers, and 982.6g if painted of a single color. This print took roughly 20 hours to print. I realize this might also be a turn off being a large print but I wasn't wanting to have to glue or screw it together if I could help it. If you are wanting this, let me know and I can work it into a new version. There are 2 version of the back plate for the different sizes of PSUs mentioned.      Here is the list of parts used for this build:              Part                      Price                        Supermicro Gen 5.5 3.5" trays (MCP-220-00075-0B) x8                          ~$50 for 8 on eBay                          Supermicro SAS833TQ 8-bay SAS backplane                          ~$35 on eBay                          SFF-8087 to SATA breakout cable x2                          ~$16                          SFF-8088 to SFF-8087 adapter                          ~$30                          Supermicro 1U PSU of dimensions 100 x 40 x 220mm or 76 x 40.3 x 192mm (As seen PWS-203-1H)                          ~32$ on eBay, also designed screw hole for PWS-351-1H ~$30 on eBay                          Molex Y-cable                          ~$6                          120mm of your choice x2 (Noctua NF-P12 shown)                          ~$16 ea.

I couldnt with the browser inspector      I do understand that the policy of the institute is not to download the classes becuase of risk of misuse, but my intentions are merely about doing a backup of the classes for future reference. The classes *will* be deleted afterwards, and is not like I will have access to other otnes im not in.      Not sure if this is the right place to ask but one can be hopeful I guess.

I need help re-thinking it.</Title><Author>u/Zach83</Author><Content>I don't know a lot about networking, storage, and proper backing up. I'm a 3d artist and do some coding on the side so I don't get scared by technical manuals or learning new tech, but proper sys adminning is not my strength.I just did some reading on things like windows backup and mirroring and now I think I need to update/change/modernize how I backup my stuff.Apparently the things I am relying on are NOT reliable at all.So I dove in and now I can't see the forest for the trees anymore. I need help thinking this out.  My current setupI have a work/gaming pc with 2 2TB drives and a synology 1 disk(2TB) NAS device.The windows PC contains important data, the NAS serves media to a media pc(that needs no backing up) and some tablets      To back these up I have a windows based "NAS" with 2 mirrored volumes, F and G. 2 4TB volumes (so 4 disks, 4TB each, 2 used for each mirorred volume)On the Work PC there are three folders that I manually backup to G while working. Daily backups sort off.Every week I run a Bat file with a few robocopy commands on the windows "NAS". The BAT maps the work PC's drives and the synology NAS drive and then does a copy with options like /mir and /purge. Essentially an incremental backup of the NAS and work PC drives to the windows "NAS".      A few times a year a I run a second bat script. It copies everything to external devices that I store in my shed. Best offsite backup available to me.  my questionsHow to mirror?Apparently windows mirrored volumes can not be relied on? I use it to protect against disk failure and apparently there are situations where the still working disk will NOT be read by another windows pc. Kinda defeats the point.I want such protection on the windows "NAS", an automatic and fast mirror copy.I want to be able to put any disk of the mirror pair in any other windows pc and have it appear like a normal disk, so it should be NTFS.What should I do? There are so many options and I have no idea what is reliable.  How to backup without Robocopy (in a file system that windows can read like ntfs, and without puting files into a proprietary binary blob)?I'm told I shouldn't use Robocopy for incremental backups because it's too easy to fuck up, and should power cut out while copying I could be fucked.Googling I went, searching for a way with the following requirements:      I want to backup the synology nas and the 2 disks on the work pc weekly, to the windows "NAS".      I only want to copy changed or new files and I want to remove files that no longer exist in the original source.      The backup should not go into a binary blob, I want loose files.      No need for file versions/history.      Timestamps(date modifed/created) are important to me.      And I found nothing. I probably don't even know the right terms to search for.How should I do this backup?      Ideally this should not involve signing up for a service or managed via a web interface hosted by some company. I want to keep everything in home and away from the internet.Free would be nice too.</Content></post><post><Title>Is the video conversion offered by VIDBOX (was Honestech) a reliable product also, how would I go about digitizing old VHS/VCR videos?</Title><Author>u/Duck_Dur</Author><Content>Hello All,      Is the video conservation service offered by VIDBOX (previously Honestech) a reliable product and how would you go about digitizing old VHS/VCR videos and if you were to recommend another brand, what would it be?

storage guide for a highschooler</Title><Author>u/MintedMince</Author><Content>Hi! So I am a highschooler from a third world country and recently I have been struggling to keep all of my data intact. I have been juggling around 1 or 2 spare hard-drives and google accounts to somehow store family photos and other important media with as many backups as I can make. The thing is, I can't really afford a lot to invest into some more high-end, and I really do not want to loose my (had a few close calls, though my backups saved me). So any advice on improving the situation or do most people hang around doing the same thing? Would love to hear from yall :)</Content></post><post><Title>Advice/guidance needed for a first time NAS builder</Title><Author>u/de4thr4sher</Author><Content>Hello everyone! I've been lurking around here for quite some time and all I'll say is that I've been inspired by your posts so much that I've decided to dive into the realm of building my first NAS and be a data hoarder myself. But I'll need your help with that as I've been very confused with a lot of things and obviously, I don't want to screw everything up.      So, first things first. My intention with the setup is purely just hoarding data on a separate machine other than my main PC while i keep everything safe and secure as much as possible. I don't need it to be accessible from anywhere or anything like that, just locally from my main PC. Like an enormous external HDD to put it simply. I don't need crazy speeds either as I won't be using it for work or anything similar. It's main use will be storing and playing my audio/video files from there and ofc, store a lot of other files and having backups of my main system and other devices.      I'll be starting with the hardware I already own and the ones I plan on buying (suggestions are welcome ofc)      *Already owned hardware*      Option 1 for mobo/CPU/RAM would be my old setup:      A Z390-E paired with a 9700k (8C/8T) and 32GB (DDR4-3000) of RAM      Option 2 would be a setup I got recently for free:      An Asus ROG Maximus VII paired with a 4790k (4C/8T) and 16GB (DDR3-1600).      A 700W Coolermaster PSU that I also got with the free setup, an old spare Kingston SSDNow V300 240GB and if I manage to finally build this NAS, I'll be getting rid of a 4TB WD drive and an 8TB Ironwolf drive.      Will I have to use the 9700k setup in this case or even the 4790k will be enough?      *Hardware I plan on buying*      The goal for now is to get 4 drives so I can have 2 of them for redundancy and add another 4 next year and hopefully I won't have a storage issue for a long time.      I've locked my eyes on Exos X16 14TB and on X18 16TB drives and a Define 7 XL R2 case for this whole setup as all these are in a fairly good price right now where I'm from. Seagate lists these drives as CMR so I guess shouldn't be concerned...? Later on I know I'll also have to get a Pci-e to 4x sata or something like that.      That's about it as far as hardware goes. Let's dive into software now, shall we?      The most confusing part for me and where I need your advice the most. What should I go for?      I see a lot of people recommending unRAID for basic setups like this. I got very confused when I was trying to decide between that or TrueNAS and eventually I gave it up and decided to ask the experts here. What would you do? Is it worth spending extra for an unRAID licence?      I know this post is stupid for 99.8% of you but it's obviously not my field of expertise and I'm trying to not spend anywhere else right now, except mainly for HDDs and a case.      Suggestions AND roasts are welcome! :) Thanks in advance!</Content></post><post><Title>Rosewill hot swap bay source/alternative?</Title><Author>u/thecaramelbandit</Author><Content>I've got a rosewill 4U case with one of their 4x3.5 hot swap enclosures.

It's a bit, but it has worked for older VHS tapes pretty well. I'm also using the basic capture software which comes with the elgato software.      While trying to get footage from my camcorder, I noticed the audio and video footage stops getting captured on my PC when the tracking gets real messy, even if only for a couple seconds, and it ruins lots of the tape.      Any suggestions for a capturing device which can handle any sort of tracking that may be required by the tapes?      To note, I'm using a Sony CCD-TRV57, which uses VHS-C tapes (they're a compact form of regular VHS tapes).</Content></post><post><Title>winhttrack problem with cloning a single landing page.

When I first started my server I only had 1 4TB drive, but I quickly outgrew that. The drive mode is set as JBOD “one drive”. I have another 4TB drive that I want to put in my NAS, but when I go in to change the RAID mode, I get warnings saying that all data will be lost. I know my only RAID options are 0 and 1. I believe I can also use JBOD as well with two drives? I’m not worried about redundancy as I can easily redownload content but would not like to have my drives erased just to add another drive.

It was over +100°F (+38°C) degrees today and the sun was beaming directly on the mailbox for 4 hours before I got to it. I suspected the box could have easily been 130°F (55°C) or possibly much hotter having been in the direct sunlight for so long. I immediately put the entire box in the refrigerator. After about 5 minutes in the fridge, I decided to measure the temp using a digital BBQ thermometer. It measured at 104°F (40°C) but this was likely not accurate because I was using a thermometer that is meant to be shoved inside of meat and the box had already been in the fridge for 5 mins.      How much damage could have been caused from it sitting in the direct +100°F (+38°C) degree sunlight for just over 4 hours?

I had some extra PSUs and fans and supermicro trays so I figured why not design around that. I've probably put no less than 40+ hours into design, print, redesign, print, try fitment etc. Not the most experience with Fusion360 or CAD in general. The front LEDs do light up during activity :). I've been thinking of expanding this into a mATX or Mini-ITX supported case as well.      I know this is also pretty much on the heals of shaztech_info but I think we have enough differences between us and I was kinda shocked to see someone else coming out with a similar idea around the same time lol. Let me know what you fellas and fellettes think!      From Makerworld:      I was unable to find a product that met my specifications of 8 hot-swap bays, a SAS backplane and external SAS connectors for easy connectivity, so I decided to design and build my own 8-bay Direct Attached Storage (DAS). This DAS features a Supermicro SAS833TQ backplane with Gen 5.5 hot-swap 3.5" trays. It is powered by either a 200W PWS-203-1H (as-shown) or a 350W PWS-351-1H (or similar units of the same dimensions: PWS-351-1H 100 x 40 x 220mm, PWS-203-1H 76 x 40.3 x 192mm) power supply. Additionally, it includes an external SAS SFF-8088 to SFF-8087 adapter to cut down on internal wires.      I printed this on my X1C and have realized that making it available for smaller print beds should also be done instead of 1 large single print.      The body is 255 W x 190 H x 245mm D, it is printed as a single print, no supports needed. The body at 10% infill, 2 walls with gyroid infill .20mm layer height with a 0.4mm nozzle. This print requires NO supports to print. The print of the body will use approximately 984.5g of filament if no painting is done of the logo or numbers, and 982.6g if painted of a single color. This print took roughly 20 hours to print. I realize this might also be a turn off being a large print but I wasn't wanting to have to glue or screw it together if I could help it. If you are wanting this, let me know and I can work it into a new version. There are 2 version of the back plate for the different sizes of PSUs mentioned.      Here is the list of parts used for this build:              Part                      Price                        Supermicro Gen 5.5 3.5" trays (MCP-220-00075-0B) x8                          ~$50 for 8 on eBay                          Supermicro SAS833TQ 8-bay SAS backplane                          ~$35 on eBay                          SFF-8087 to SATA breakout cable x2                          ~$16                          SFF-8088 to SFF-8087 adapter                          ~$30                          Supermicro 1U PSU of dimensions 100 x 40 x 220mm or 76 x 40.3 x 192mm (As seen PWS-203-1H)                          ~32$ on eBay, also designed screw hole for PWS-351-1H ~$30 on eBay                          Molex Y-cable                          ~$6                          120mm of your choice x2 (Noctua NF-P12 shown)                          ~$16 ea.

I need help re-thinking it.</Title><Author>u/Zach83</Author><Content>I don't know a lot about networking, storage, and proper backing up. I'm a 3d artist and do some coding on the side so I don't get scared by technical manuals or learning new tech, but proper sys adminning is not my strength.I just did some reading on things like windows backup and mirroring and now I think I need to update/change/modernize how I backup my stuff.Apparently the things I am relying on are NOT reliable at all.So I dove in and now I can't see the forest for the trees anymore. I need help thinking this out.  My current setupI have a work/gaming pc with 2 2TB drives and a synology 1 disk(2TB) NAS device.The windows PC contains important data, the NAS serves media to a media pc(that needs no backing up) and some tablets      To back these up I have a windows based "NAS" with 2 mirrored volumes, F and G. 2 4TB volumes (so 4 disks, 4TB each, 2 used for each mirorred volume)On the Work PC there are three folders that I manually backup to G while working. Daily backups sort off.Every week I run a Bat file with a few robocopy commands on the windows "NAS". The BAT maps the work PC's drives and the synology NAS drive and then does a copy with options like /mir and /purge. Essentially an incremental backup of the NAS and work PC drives to the windows "NAS".      A few times a year a I run a second bat script. It copies everything to external devices that I store in my shed. Best offsite backup available to me.  my questionsHow to mirror?Apparently windows mirrored volumes can not be relied on? I use it to protect against disk failure and apparently there are situations where the still working disk will NOT be read by another windows pc. Kinda defeats the point.I want such protection on the windows "NAS", an automatic and fast mirror copy.I want to be able to put any disk of the mirror pair in any other windows pc and have it appear like a normal disk, so it should be NTFS.What should I do? There are so many options and I have no idea what is reliable.  How to backup without Robocopy (in a file system that windows can read like ntfs, and without puting files into a proprietary binary blob)?I'm told I shouldn't use Robocopy for incremental backups because it's too easy to fuck up, and should power cut out while copying I could be fucked.Googling I went, searching for a way with the following requirements:      I want to backup the synology nas and the 2 disks on the work pc weekly, to the windows "NAS".      I only want to copy changed or new files and I want to remove files that no longer exist in the original source.      The backup should not go into a binary blob, I want loose files.      No need for file versions/history.      Timestamps(date modifed/created) are important to me.      And I found nothing. I probably don't even know the right terms to search for.How should I do this backup?      Ideally this should not involve signing up for a service or managed via a web interface hosted by some company. I want to keep everything in home and away from the internet.Free would be nice too.</Content></post><post><Title>Is the video conversion offered by VIDBOX (was Honestech) a reliable product also, how would I go about digitizing old VHS/VCR videos?</Title><Author>u/Duck_Dur</Author><Content>Hello All,      Is the video conservation service offered by VIDBOX (previously Honestech) a reliable product and how would you go about digitizing old VHS/VCR videos and if you were to recommend another brand, what would it be?

storage guide for a highschooler</Title><Author>u/MintedMince</Author><Content>Hi! So I am a highschooler from a third world country and recently I have been struggling to keep all of my data intact. I have been juggling around 1 or 2 spare hard-drives and google accounts to somehow store family photos and other important media with as many backups as I can make. The thing is, I can't really afford a lot to invest into some more high-end, and I really do not want to loose my (had a few close calls, though my backups saved me). So any advice on improving the situation or do most people hang around doing the same thing? Would love to hear from yall :)</Content></post><post><Title>Advice/guidance needed for a first time NAS builder</Title><Author>u/de4thr4sher</Author><Content>Hello everyone! I've been lurking around here for quite some time and all I'll say is that I've been inspired by your posts so much that I've decided to dive into the realm of building my first NAS and be a data hoarder myself. But I'll need your help with that as I've been very confused with a lot of things and obviously, I don't want to screw everything up.      So, first things first. My intention with the setup is purely just hoarding data on a separate machine other than my main PC while i keep everything safe and secure as much as possible. I don't need it to be accessible from anywhere or anything like that, just locally from my main PC. Like an enormous external HDD to put it simply. I don't need crazy speeds either as I won't be using it for work or anything similar. It's main use will be storing and playing my audio/video files from there and ofc, store a lot of other files and having backups of my main system and other devices.      I'll be starting with the hardware I already own and the ones I plan on buying (suggestions are welcome ofc)      *Already owned hardware*      Option 1 for mobo/CPU/RAM would be my old setup:      A Z390-E paired with a 9700k (8C/8T) and 32GB (DDR4-3000) of RAM      Option 2 would be a setup I got recently for free:      An Asus ROG Maximus VII paired with a 4790k (4C/8T) and 16GB (DDR3-1600).      A 700W Coolermaster PSU that I also got with the free setup, an old spare Kingston SSDNow V300 240GB and if I manage to finally build this NAS, I'll be getting rid of a 4TB WD drive and an 8TB Ironwolf drive.      Will I have to use the 9700k setup in this case or even the 4790k will be enough?      *Hardware I plan on buying*      The goal for now is to get 4 drives so I can have 2 of them for redundancy and add another 4 next year and hopefully I won't have a storage issue for a long time.      I've locked my eyes on Exos X16 14TB and on X18 16TB drives and a Define 7 XL R2 case for this whole setup as all these are in a fairly good price right now where I'm from. Seagate lists these drives as CMR so I guess shouldn't be concerned...? Later on I know I'll also have to get a Pci-e to 4x sata or something like that.      That's about it as far as hardware goes. Let's dive into software now, shall we?      The most confusing part for me and where I need your advice the most. What should I go for?      I see a lot of people recommending unRAID for basic setups like this. I got very confused when I was trying to decide between that or TrueNAS and eventually I gave it up and decided to ask the experts here. What would you do? Is it worth spending extra for an unRAID licence?      I know this post is stupid for 99.8% of you but it's obviously not my field of expertise and I'm trying to not spend anywhere else right now, except mainly for HDDs and a case.      Suggestions AND roasts are welcome! :) Thanks in advance!</Content></post><post><Title>Rosewill hot swap bay source/alternative?</Title><Author>u/thecaramelbandit</Author><Content>I've got a rosewill 4U case with one of their 4x3.5 hot swap enclosures.

Lsyncd, DRDB or Kopia backup</Title><Author>u/1000Zebras</Author><Content>Hi,      I'm curious what you guys would implement in this situation in order to, above all, simply maintain at the very least one solid, off-site backup of all of my data files and also, in the event of something happening to my main data drive on-site, reduce downtime as much as possible.      Here is my current setup as is relevant to the question at hand:      OrangePi 5 Plus running dietpi (so pretty much just debian) as my main server on-site      One eMMC boot drive on the OrangePi containing the OS and all of my docker-compose files, as well as the OS itself      Recently acquired 14TB external USB drive that houses purely my data for all of my docker containers (and then some outside of those, as well, but not much)      OrangePi is running Tailscale      A second RPi that lives at my brother's house also running Tailscale (so any connection between the two will more than likely be running over the interwebs, but through Tailscale) and with a second 14tb drive identical to the other connected to it, ready for data storage      What I'm wondering is what may be the best strategy for maintaining a backup of the main data drive on the secondary drive, ideally in a mirrored fashion such that were the main drive to fail, I'd simply be able to plug in the secondary drive to the OrangePi, mount it at the same mountpoint as primary would have been, and I'd be back up and running nearly immediately (once the drive was physically moved between locations, of course).      It's worth noting that, at present, I am dealing with nearly 4.5TB of data on main data drive (also currently backed up to the cloud via Kopia and iDrive E2)      I've been considering:      Trying out lsyncd or DRDB in order to literally have the drives mirror each other in as near realtime as the connection will allow. I have not used either of these tools yet, however, so I'm not familiar with exactly how they work behind the scene. And also, I realize that it is a lot of data to keep in sync over an internet connection, especially at file or block-level granularity as I believe those tools are designed for. In "normal" usage, I am not necessarily adding or changing all that much data on a day to day basis, but were I to make any major shifts in organization, or simply to add a lot more data into the mix suddenly, I'm wondering if the tools would be able to keep up      Running an rsync job over ssh at a specified interval (say, maybe, a couple of times a day) in order to keep the two up date. I would of course again run into the same problem that would arise with the first option were I to make any drastic changes, but theoretically I'd eventually always have a 1 to 1 sync/backup between the two drives      Simply running some sort of backup program from the main Orangepi data drive to the RPi's data drive, again at whatever specified interval (say, maybe, daily). I'd probably have to run some sort of webDAV server on the secondary RPi in order to facilitate backups between the two were I to use Kopia. Or, I suppose I could even run the data drive on RPi on a minio instance and have Kopia backup via the S3 protocol, but this seems perhaps like a little bit of overkill, and it wouldn't necessarily be the sort of 1 to 1 sync I'm shooting for as Kopia would organize the backup data in a fashion that it understands. This would be acceptable, though, as again at the end of the day the most important thing is to have all of the data itself stored safely in both locations, one way or another.      How would you guys go about keeping things in sync between the two data drives? Or, should I just eschew that idea given the limitations of the bandwidth/connection between the two and go for straight backups using Kopia, or some othe rbackup system?      Please, if you have any thoughts on how you'd architect this scenario, I'd very much appreciate any and perspectives/insights.      Hopefully that all makes sense. If you need anything clarified, by all means speak up and I'll do my best to address.      Thank you so very much for your time, expertise, and patience with my rambling question. I look forward to hearing how people weigh in.      Kind Regards,      LS</Content></post><post><Title>NAS vs just in PC</Title><Author>u/EnigmatheEgg</Author><Content>Hi all!

Lsyncd, DRDB or Kopia backup</Title><Author>u/1000Zebras</Author><Content>Hi,      I'm curious what you guys would implement in this situation in order to, above all, simply maintain at the very least one solid, off-site backup of all of my data files and also, in the event of something happening to my main data drive on-site, reduce downtime as much as possible.      Here is my current setup as is relevant to the question at hand:      OrangePi 5 Plus running dietpi (so pretty much just debian) as my main server on-site      One eMMC boot drive on the OrangePi containing the OS and all of my docker-compose files, as well as the OS itself      Recently acquired 14TB external USB drive that houses purely my data for all of my docker containers (and then some outside of those, as well, but not much)      OrangePi is running Tailscale      A second RPi that lives at my brother's house also running Tailscale (so any connection between the two will more than likely be running over the interwebs, but through Tailscale) and with a second 14tb drive identical to the other connected to it, ready for data storage      What I'm wondering is what may be the best strategy for maintaining a backup of the main data drive on the secondary drive, ideally in a mirrored fashion such that were the main drive to fail, I'd simply be able to plug in the secondary drive to the OrangePi, mount it at the same mountpoint as primary would have been, and I'd be back up and running nearly immediately (once the drive was physically moved between locations, of course).      It's worth noting that, at present, I am dealing with nearly 4.5TB of data on main data drive (also currently backed up to the cloud via Kopia and iDrive E2)      I've been considering:      Trying out lsyncd or DRDB in order to literally have the drives mirror each other in as near realtime as the connection will allow. I have not used either of these tools yet, however, so I'm not familiar with exactly how they work behind the scene. And also, I realize that it is a lot of data to keep in sync over an internet connection, especially at file or block-level granularity as I believe those tools are designed for. In "normal" usage, I am not necessarily adding or changing all that much data on a day to day basis, but were I to make any major shifts in organization, or simply to add a lot more data into the mix suddenly, I'm wondering if the tools would be able to keep up      Running an rsync job over ssh at a specified interval (say, maybe, a couple of times a day) in order to keep the two up date. I would of course again run into the same problem that would arise with the first option were I to make any drastic changes, but theoretically I'd eventually always have a 1 to 1 sync/backup between the two drives      Simply running some sort of backup program from the main Orangepi data drive to the RPi's data drive, again at whatever specified interval (say, maybe, daily). I'd probably have to run some sort of webDAV server on the secondary RPi in order to facilitate backups between the two were I to use Kopia. Or, I suppose I could even run the data drive on RPi on a minio instance and have Kopia backup via the S3 protocol, but this seems perhaps like a little bit of overkill, and it wouldn't necessarily be the sort of 1 to 1 sync I'm shooting for as Kopia would organize the backup data in a fashion that it understands. This would be acceptable, though, as again at the end of the day the most important thing is to have all of the data itself stored safely in both locations, one way or another.      How would you guys go about keeping things in sync between the two data drives? Or, should I just eschew that idea given the limitations of the bandwidth/connection between the two and go for straight backups using Kopia, or some othe rbackup system?

Start a copy job, reach the avg-peak of 100MB/s and then the software becomes aware of this and then continues to enumerate folders as subtasks and starts these folders on the other IP addresses available from the NAS.

The catch is that it doesn't have an SD card and that taking any additional photos after its filled starts to delete them.      It does use a 3.5 mm cord with some kind of port for vintage computers. I have no problem getting a 3.5 mm to USB cord.      Is there a similar process with data recovery for SD cards and hard drives that I can do with recovering data from the camera?  Would I also need some drivers for this camera to detect too?

It seems on here some people mention the WD black being total rubish. I really like these drives for the aesthetic, but have never owned one. I have owned the MyPassport models for years and years and have never had an issue. Are they equal and i'm safe to get the WD Black for aesthetics? Or would it be wiser to get the MyPassport Ultra, with the metal build and USB-C Connection?      I would be using this drive for time machine backups.

I'm planning to keep my SSD portable (on a trip etc) and whenever I'm at home, connect it to a system (rasp pi or a regular PC) with photoprism or librephotos installed.

I recently switched over from my HP Omen laptop to a new MacBook Pro. Not knowing about the data formatting situation, I backed up all my data from my old laptop onto my Seagate Expansion Portable Drive 2TB. When using my MacBook, I noticed I couldn't upload files to this harddrive because the file formatting was different.      I found on the internet that to switch the external harddrive from NTFS to APFS I can use Disk Utility to reformat the device. For this to happen however i have to backup the files that I have on my external harddrive, because to reformat it the harddrive has to be erased.      The thing is, if i back-up the files to my old HP Omen, I can't reupload the files back to my external hard drive because it has been reformatted to APFS, and the files are NTFS. I also can't back-up the files to my new MacBook, because the size of my files is way to big for the internal storage of my Macbook!      Is the only option for this really just to buy another external harddrive coded to APFS, or keep my files on my hard drive on my old dusty laptop that barely functions?

I'm late to the party on this but I thought if there are some people already on the case then maybe users from this subreddit might be interested in finding them to help with backups and hosting.      The NOAA is shutting down some of their online and printed services and they are removing that data from their websites. This project actually began in 2021 and is set to be completed in 2025.  So what is the RNC?    NOAA's RNC Tile Service (WMTS)      The NOAA RNC Tile Service provides standardized nautical chart tilesets for the public, eliminating the need for application developers to regularly undergo the cumbersome process of transforming NOAA BSB files into tilesets. It provides geo-referenced charts compatible with the Web Map Tile Specifications (WMTS) and Tile Map Service Specification (TMS). All tilesets are published on a weekly basis.      Original website (already deleted?): https://tileservice.charts.noaa.gov    Their annoucement:      NOAA will shut down its Raster Navigational Chart (RNC) Tile Service and the online RNC Viewer on October 1, 2021. The NOAA Seamless Raster Navigational Chart Services will be shut down on January 1, 2022. This is part of a larger NOAA program to end production and maintenance of all NOAA traditional paper and raster nautical charts that was announced in the Federal Register in November 2019.      Cancellation of traditional NOAA paper nautical charts and associated raster nautical chart products, such as BookletCharts™ and Raster Navigational Charts (RNC) will occur over the next four years and be completed by January 2025. More information about this overarching program to “sunset” traditional  nautical chart products is available on the “Farewell to Traditional Nautical Charts” web page.      -- sourceWhy help with this project?    The abandoned nautical tilesets and paper charts have been replaced with GIS offerings for modern equipment, however these older documents were a failsafe for smaller vessels and operations. They may not have the technical know how to backup and retrieve this data otherwise.</Content></post><post><Title>Sort backup raid 1</Title><Author>u/sweetestpeach94</Author><Content>Hi, I hope I can get some help.

(Related to EA games)</Title><Author>u/EUOS_the_cat</Author><Content>Let me know if this isn't the right sub for this, and if it isn't, point me in the right direction please.      I'm on a mission to extract models from old Littlest Pet Shop games (PC, Wii), and unfortunately they were made by EA. Me and another person have looked into it, and the models are stored in the .big format. These have ways to be opened, however they lead to the .rpk files that have no information that either of us could find on how to get into. The only info about them I see is that they're used as skins for RadLight, which obviously isn't what these files are.      If anyone knows a way to get into these files, I'd be very thankful.</Content></post><post><Title>CGSociety - Site Rip</Title><Author>u/valdearg</Author><Content>Completely forgot about this from https://old.reddit.com/r/DataHoarder/comments/18tlukv/cgsociety_is_closing_up_soon_decades_of_valuable/https://archive.org/details/cgsocietyarchive    It's about 300GB+      Images has JSON files with their metadata alongside it.

First time on the sub. Planning on upgrading my laptop to 4TB M.2 SSD and I'm looking at possible brand options. I know Samsung and Crucial are very good options, but at the same time I wanna know if Kingston and Corsair are also good options in today's market for long term storage and speed.      Context: I'm moving from a 1TB WD SATA HDD and 128GB TOSHIBA M.2 SSD combo that came with my laptop, and they've been slowly failing with disk 100 usage when I have plenty of space. I'm also planning to move all my family memories from an assortment of thumbdrives and majority of Google Cloud storage to a partition I'll make after I upgrade. I'm also on a relative budget of max around €320 / $330      I hope fellow data hoarders will help a newbie like me with this, as I also don't have the money for a 990/980 PRO atm, and the laptop will be a storage driver after I upgrade to a tower in the future years.</Content></post><post><Title>NVMe SSD enclosure vs Portable external SSD?</Title><Author>u/ProFalseIdol</Author><Content>I am looking for at least 1TB to store videos and pictures.

I'm late to the party on this but I thought if there are some people already on the case then maybe users from this subreddit might be interested in finding them to help with backups and hosting.      The NOAA is shutting down some of their online and printed services and they are removing that data from their websites. This project actually began in 2021 and is set to be completed in 2025.  So what is the RNC?    NOAA's RNC Tile Service (WMTS)      The NOAA RNC Tile Service provides standardized nautical chart tilesets for the public, eliminating the need for application developers to regularly undergo the cumbersome process of transforming NOAA BSB files into tilesets. It provides geo-referenced charts compatible with the Web Map Tile Specifications (WMTS) and Tile Map Service Specification (TMS). All tilesets are published on a weekly basis.      Original website (already deleted?): https://tileservice.charts.noaa.gov    Their annoucement:      NOAA will shut down its Raster Navigational Chart (RNC) Tile Service and the online RNC Viewer on October 1, 2021. The NOAA Seamless Raster Navigational Chart Services will be shut down on January 1, 2022. This is part of a larger NOAA program to end production and maintenance of all NOAA traditional paper and raster nautical charts that was announced in the Federal Register in November 2019.      Cancellation of traditional NOAA paper nautical charts and associated raster nautical chart products, such as BookletCharts™ and Raster Navigational Charts (RNC) will occur over the next four years and be completed by January 2025. More information about this overarching program to “sunset” traditional  nautical chart products is available on the “Farewell to Traditional Nautical Charts” web page.      -- sourceWhy help with this project?    The abandoned nautical tilesets and paper charts have been replaced with GIS offerings for modern equipment, however these older documents were a failsafe for smaller vessels and operations. They may not have the technical know how to backup and retrieve this data otherwise.</Content></post><post><Title>Sort backup raid 1</Title><Author>u/sweetestpeach94</Author><Content>Hi, I hope I can get some help.

I need help figuring out the 2-1 part of my 3-2-1 plan.      Most of my data is on the primary NAS, about 20TB worth. A stupid amount of it is large raw photos from vacations--let's say 8TB. The rest is a packrat assortment of All The Things going back to the early 00s and most of it is personal large data like video game development environments, art assets, etc that I consider irreplaceable. Storage is two 2x12TB mirrors.      I also have up to 1TB of data per Windows PC. The important folders get backed up to the NAS via Veeam Agent, so I have a handful of several-hundred-GB files per PC there.      My Linux PCs are mostly covered by BackupPC, which is very crusty these days and I may end up switching to something else. That's another topic for another day. It's not very much data. But it also also stores on the NAS.      The NAS itself is replicated via zfs send to a local secondary NAS. The primary NAS has mirrored zdevs but the secondary NAS has single drive zdevs, so two separate 12TB drives.      So my data sources and primary backups are:      Windows PCs -&amp;gt; NAS -&amp;gt; backup NAS (via zfs replication of Veeam directory)      Linux PCs -&amp;gt; NAS -&amp;gt; backup NAS (via zfs replication of backuppc dir)      NAS -&amp;gt; secondary NAS (via zfs replication)      You're probably noticing the glaring hole in my setup: off-site replication for the NAS. What would you do for your offsite backup? There are a dizzying array of options for slapping data on some 12TB externals. Encryption seems like a good idea in case of theft (lots of receipts, financial documents, etc). But do I layer it on top of something like LUKS? zfs native encryption? Do those play well with big external drives?      I was using zfs replication for awhile to an external drive, but this would be my "my house and neighborhood burned down" recovery plan, which makes me worry about starting from nothing: is a backup that I can't access with a surviving Windows laptop (easiest thing to get my hands on) worth anything? What's the Windows-compatible field look like?      My biggest two worries are: being able to start over from nothing after a natural disaster (#1) and stolen drives (#2).      As a side note, the Veeam files are huge and are a non-trivial amount of time to transfer during a backup...I wish Veeam Agent (standalone) could hit multiple backup targets on a rotation...

I'm looking to backup a zpool of media. I had tried to setup a truenas for the data but I didn't love the UI and I have what I need on Ubuntu with docker. My plan is to destroy a zpool of the truenas made of 4x10tb raidz1 and move that pool into the primary server (add a pcie with more sata ports) then use zpool attach to mirror my current 4x8tb raidz1 (mnt) to the newly recreated zpool of the 4x10tb from the old truenas server (named mntbackup). So zpool attach mnt to mntbackup. Sounds like this automatically starts mirroring.      I know this isn't ideal without being an off-site backup but I'm not the most literate at actually managing this and want something easy. Would I be able to just plug in backup, then unplug the backup pool and cold storage? I don't need perfect redundancy. Would I be able to plug the mntbackup raidz1 back in sometime in the future and the missing new data automatically sync or would I need scripts of rysnc or zfs send receive to add new data?

I've used few file restoration programs, and managed to salvage about 80% of everything that was on the drive, but the problem is, like 70% of what I've restored is either corrupted, or doesn't have audio. And all the files were put into ~75 different folders, with around 900 or so files each.I'd like to sort out the files with audio and without, in order to save the good ones and get rid of the bad ones.All files were renamed to random letters and numbers by recovery software, so the corrupted and muted files are basically completely useless to me, since I can't even use the file names to find out what files those are.      All the files are either .mp4, .mkv, .avi, .mov or .wmv.      Sorting through tens of thousands of files would take me months, and I just don't have the time or patience to do that. I've had the idea of importing files into video editing soft like Premiere and look at the generated waveform to find out good files,  but there's quite a lot of files with codecs unsupported by Premiere, like VP09 and such, so vast majority of files, even with audio present show up as flat lines on Premiere waveform, thus this method is completely useless to me. Like, importing a folder of restored files only generates maybe 20-30 waveforms, the rest are flat lines, and so manual sorting is still required.      Anyone know of any software that can scan thousands of files and either mark or separate them by presence of audio, or have some other solution?</Content></post><post><Title>Help getting a 3D model from web model viewer, is it possible?</Title><Author>u/ConsistentYou4832</Author><Content>I have seen this question asked many times in this subreddit, and this time was my time.

I currently have a small RAID 1 file server running Samba and while I manually copy files from my computers to this server, I wanted to see if there was software that could automated this.      The goal is for this software to automatically copy a new completed file placed in the documents folder to a  network drive that is available on the same computer. Literally "copy this file over there when it exists". I looked into FreeFileSync and Syncthing but these appear to sync directly to a server instead to a local folder.      One additional thing I an looking for is two-way syncing. This way, I can make a "universal" document folders where all my computers will have the same content, and update them if they are missing anything. This could count as additional backup since I would have the same files over many computers.      Does anyone have recommendations for a software solution?      Preferably:      Open source      "Live" syncing (runs when new or changed file detected instead of scheduled syncing)      Flexible / Plenty of Options / Configurable      Uses native Windows file commands      Doesn't hurt, but works on Linux (I have "better" options for my Linux machines though)      I appreciate any recommendations!

I just received the following notification from Google Drive that my Google Drive Workspace Enterprise Standard will soon be suspended and all my data will be deleted.  The Notice From Google    To explain my situation, basically like a lot of us on this subreddit, I signed up for Google Drive several years ago by paying $20 a month with only one user and been enjoying the unlimited space until July 2023 when I was hit with a notice claiming my unlimited space is coming to an end.      Reading the information of this subreddit around a year ago, I thought I have 2 years until the data will be deleted so I did not take any action to transfer my data but simply kept paying the $20 (now $27) every month with my account being in read-only mode until last month when I got hit with this notice as shown in the screenshot. This has made me very nervous and I have started to transfer all my data locally last month.      Overall, I have around 200 TB of data (the dominant majority of them are Japanese TV programs I have recorded from my TV) and I intend to keep all of them as I have been hoarding these for over a decade and many of them are precious, meaning they are not even available for purchase in commercial settings, i.e., there is no way to get original recording of those TV programs from several years ago or a decade ago even if you offer to pay someone, there is simply no one who is selling, not even the TV stations.      I already purchased 30 Seagate 8TB HDDs so there is no issue with the local storage problem for me. However, the issue is that after all 200 TB is 200 TB, and there is no way for me to download 200 TB in one month. Currently, I am using my company's Ethernet to download those data but as we all know HDD's written speed is limited to 60 megabytes per second, the physical limit means I could transfer at maximum 5 TB per day even if my Ethernet speed exceeds 60 megabytes per second. Based on my real test, I can currently pull around 3 to 4 TB per day from my Google Drive account. However, this is not gonna be enough as my account will be suspended on June 22, 2024. Before then, I could at most pull around 75 to 80 TB from my Google Drive account.      Therefore, I am here trying to seek fellow datahoarders' wisdom here. Personally I have come up with the following solutions, could anyone help me assess how viable they are, or if better, is there any possibility that someone knows an even better solution than any of the ones I came up with on my own?  Solution 1:    Contact Google Workspace support and ask for extension of suspension. I am wondering whether it is possible to simply contact Google Workspace support and ask for mercy so that I could just delay the suspension of my account for 2 months. As you know, I can pull around 3 TB of data per day so that so long as I have around 60-70 days, I would be able to download all of my data from my Google Drive. Is this a viable solution? Would Google be flexible enough to agree to this with me only continuing to pay $27 per month?      Additionally, I found it impossible to directly contact Google with regard to this. When I click the help button in the Admin Console as shown below, I am always directed to a chatbot but am unable to talk to a real human being. Does anyone know how I could directly reach out to a Google personnel and ask for extension?  Admin ConsoleSolution 2:    Simply adding more users on a temporary basis. I heard some rumors saying that when you have 5 users (currently I only have one) in your Google Workspace, you are kind of treated differently. While I know there is no way that by having 5 users I would be granted 200 TB space, all I need is to stop the imminent deletion of my data. If adding to 5 users can grant me some status and put a stop to the suspension, I could just afford to pay 5-user fee for 2 more months and transfer all my data locally and then I could just cancel them altogether and say goodbye to Google. Does anyone know whether this approach would work? As the notice from Google claimed that "If you take no action your account will be suspended.", I am wondering whether adding to 5 users would count as "some action" and at least stop the imminent deletion of all my data on June 22, 2024...

As such, when my 16 drive UnRAID server ran out of drive slots, the only solution was to build a second server which is in the Livingroom, in a 4U Rosewill case, sitting discretely in an Ikea Lack table with caster wheels.  The main server has a Ryzen 9 3950X and does all the dockers and stuff.  The secondary server has an Intel E5 2697v2 and sits there eating electricity for the sake of letting me run 12 more drives.      But we're moving!  Three floors!  Gonna run ethernet in all the walls.  There will be a finished basement area for 'the gaming goodness' and I can finally set up network and storage in a real rack, on the unfinished side of the basement, with it's own 15amp circuit and where no one will care how much noise anything in there makes.  That means I an get disk shelf and make all of this way less stupid!      The main plan is to retire the server inside the 4U rack case, then transplant the main tower server into that 4U rack case and expand it's drive capacity with a disk shelf.  So here's where I have questions:      Firstly, things like the NetApp DS4246 and related seem to be what I'm looking at.  All my drives are SATA, to these disk shelves support SATA out of the box, is additional hardware required for SATA drives, or do I need to look for something alternate/specific?      Secondly, these shelves offer up to four PSUs for redundancy, but how many are needed at minimum assuming 'up time' is not a major concern?  Also what kind of power consumption should I see beyond the drives it's powering?  I should def see an advantage over a whole 11 year old Xeon running, right?      Thirdly, for the 'host server' to access this kind of disk shelf, I should only require something like an LSI 9201-16E and a quartet of 8088 to SFF-8088 cables, right?  From there on, the host device should just have an LSI controller which see's up to 24 drives on it, and it's all happy and 'just works'?</Content></post><post><Title>Is it worth archiving random pages aimlessly?</Title><Author>u/peliciego</Author><Content>Hi folks.

I need help figuring out the 2-1 part of my 3-2-1 plan.      Most of my data is on the primary NAS, about 20TB worth. A stupid amount of it is large raw photos from vacations--let's say 8TB. The rest is a packrat assortment of All The Things going back to the early 00s and most of it is personal large data like video game development environments, art assets, etc that I consider irreplaceable. Storage is two 2x12TB mirrors.      I also have up to 1TB of data per Windows PC. The important folders get backed up to the NAS via Veeam Agent, so I have a handful of several-hundred-GB files per PC there.      My Linux PCs are mostly covered by BackupPC, which is very crusty these days and I may end up switching to something else. That's another topic for another day. It's not very much data. But it also also stores on the NAS.      The NAS itself is replicated via zfs send to a local secondary NAS. The primary NAS has mirrored zdevs but the secondary NAS has single drive zdevs, so two separate 12TB drives.      So my data sources and primary backups are:      Windows PCs -&amp;gt; NAS -&amp;gt; backup NAS (via zfs replication of Veeam directory)      Linux PCs -&amp;gt; NAS -&amp;gt; backup NAS (via zfs replication of backuppc dir)      NAS -&amp;gt; secondary NAS (via zfs replication)      You're probably noticing the glaring hole in my setup: off-site replication for the NAS. What would you do for your offsite backup? There are a dizzying array of options for slapping data on some 12TB externals. Encryption seems like a good idea in case of theft (lots of receipts, financial documents, etc). But do I layer it on top of something like LUKS? zfs native encryption? Do those play well with big external drives?      I was using zfs replication for awhile to an external drive, but this would be my "my house and neighborhood burned down" recovery plan, which makes me worry about starting from nothing: is a backup that I can't access with a surviving Windows laptop (easiest thing to get my hands on) worth anything? What's the Windows-compatible field look like?      My biggest two worries are: being able to start over from nothing after a natural disaster (#1) and stolen drives (#2).      As a side note, the Veeam files are huge and are a non-trivial amount of time to transfer during a backup...I wish Veeam Agent (standalone) could hit multiple backup targets on a rotation...

He would prefer PC software, no mobile apps or online-only (have to register an account) platforms, browser-based is fine though.      I've tried doing a bit of looking myself but most personal film cataloguing software is focused on physical media (DVDs, Blu-Rays, etc.) and not a digital collection.</Content></post><post><Title>Looking for some critiquing of my plan.</Title><Author>u/OnenonlyAl</Author><Content>Thanks for taking the time to read and comment. I'm looking to backup a zpool of media. I had tried to setup a truenas for the data but I didn't love the UI and I have what I need on Ubuntu with docker. My plan is to destroy a zpool of the truenas made of 4x10tb raidz1 and move that pool into the primary server (add a pcie with more sata ports) then use zpool attach to mirror my current 4x8tb raidz1 (mnt) to the newly recreated zpool of the 4x10tb from the old truenas server (named mntbackup). So zpool attach mnt to mntbackup. Sounds like this automatically starts mirroring.      I know this isn't ideal without being an off-site backup but I'm not the most literate at actually managing this and want something easy. Would I be able to just plug in backup, then unplug the backup pool and cold storage? I don't need perfect redundancy. Would I be able to plug the mntbackup raidz1 back in sometime in the future and the missing new data automatically sync or would I need scripts of rysnc or zfs send receive to add new data?      Thanks for any insight and help!</Content></post><post><Title>Sorting tens of thousands of recovered video files by presence of audio?</Title><Author>u/CyberpunkLover</Author><Content>I've been collecting music video clips for about 15 years now, and collected something like 85k clips.I've been putting everything on hard drives, then after filling them up, moving everything to larger drive.The last drive I've used was some Western Digital Blue 8TB drive, and last week it filled up, so I purchased a new 20TB drive and was about to copy everything into it, but before I could do that, the WD drive failed.      I've used few file restoration programs, and managed to salvage about 80% of everything that was on the drive, but the problem is, like 70% of what I've restored is either corrupted, or doesn't have audio. And all the files were put into ~75 different folders, with around 900 or so files each.I'd like to sort out the files with audio and without, in order to save the good ones and get rid of the bad ones.All files were renamed to random letters and numbers by recovery software, so the corrupted and muted files are basically completely useless to me, since I can't even use the file names to find out what files those are.      All the files are either .mp4, .mkv, .avi, .mov or .wmv.      Sorting through tens of thousands of files would take me months, and I just don't have the time or patience to do that. I've had the idea of importing files into video editing soft like Premiere and look at the generated waveform to find out good files,  but there's quite a lot of files with codecs unsupported by Premiere, like VP09 and such, so vast majority of files, even with audio present show up as flat lines on Premiere waveform, thus this method is completely useless to me. Like, importing a folder of restored files only generates maybe 20-30 waveforms, the rest are flat lines, and so manual sorting is still required.      Anyone know of any software that can scan thousands of files and either mark or separate them by presence of audio, or have some other solution?</Content></post><post><Title>Help getting a 3D model from web model viewer, is it possible?</Title><Author>u/ConsistentYou4832</Author><Content>I have seen this question asked many times in this subreddit, and this time was my time.

I currently have a small RAID 1 file server running Samba and while I manually copy files from my computers to this server, I wanted to see if there was software that could automated this.      The goal is for this software to automatically copy a new completed file placed in the documents folder to a  network drive that is available on the same computer. Literally "copy this file over there when it exists". I looked into FreeFileSync and Syncthing but these appear to sync directly to a server instead to a local folder.      One additional thing I an looking for is two-way syncing. This way, I can make a "universal" document folders where all my computers will have the same content, and update them if they are missing anything. This could count as additional backup since I would have the same files over many computers.      Does anyone have recommendations for a software solution?      Preferably:      Open source      "Live" syncing (runs when new or changed file detected instead of scheduled syncing)      Flexible / Plenty of Options / Configurable      Uses native Windows file commands      Doesn't hurt, but works on Linux (I have "better" options for my Linux machines though)      I appreciate any recommendations!      Edit: I remember SyncToy which would be perfect, if anyone knows of an open source version of SyncToy, then that would be what I am looking for!</Content></post><post><Title>UPS APC BX1200MI-MS a good choice with no fans?</Title><Author>u/maguillo</Author><Content>Hello , I am about to buy the APC BX1200MI-MS with 1200VA and 650W (for the price) to back my nas , but the thing is it does not have fans to cool the device like other models , so I dont know if is or not necessary as I dont want the place smell burnt plastic , or how it disipates the heat?

I just received the following notification from Google Drive that my Google Drive Workspace Enterprise Standard will soon be suspended and all my data will be deleted.  The Notice From Google    To explain my situation, basically like a lot of us on this subreddit, I signed up for Google Drive several years ago by paying $20 a month with only one user and been enjoying the unlimited space until July 2023 when I was hit with a notice claiming my unlimited space is coming to an end.      Reading the information of this subreddit around a year ago, I thought I have 2 years until the data will be deleted so I did not take any action to transfer my data but simply kept paying the $20 (now $27) every month with my account being in read-only mode until last month when I got hit with this notice as shown in the screenshot. This has made me very nervous and I have started to transfer all my data locally last month.      Overall, I have around 200 TB of data (the dominant majority of them are Japanese TV programs I have recorded from my TV) and I intend to keep all of them as I have been hoarding these for over a decade and many of them are precious, meaning they are not even available for purchase in commercial settings, i.e., there is no way to get original recording of those TV programs from several years ago or a decade ago even if you offer to pay someone, there is simply no one who is selling, not even the TV stations.      I already purchased 30 Seagate 8TB HDDs so there is no issue with the local storage problem for me. However, the issue is that after all 200 TB is 200 TB, and there is no way for me to download 200 TB in one month. Currently, I am using my company's Ethernet to download those data but as we all know HDD's written speed is limited to 60 megabytes per second, the physical limit means I could transfer at maximum 5 TB per day even if my Ethernet speed exceeds 60 megabytes per second. Based on my real test, I can currently pull around 3 to 4 TB per day from my Google Drive account. However, this is not gonna be enough as my account will be suspended on June 22, 2024. Before then, I could at most pull around 75 to 80 TB from my Google Drive account.      Therefore, I am here trying to seek fellow datahoarders' wisdom here. Personally I have come up with the following solutions, could anyone help me assess how viable they are, or if better, is there any possibility that someone knows an even better solution than any of the ones I came up with on my own?  Solution 1:    Contact Google Workspace support and ask for extension of suspension. I am wondering whether it is possible to simply contact Google Workspace support and ask for mercy so that I could just delay the suspension of my account for 2 months. As you know, I can pull around 3 TB of data per day so that so long as I have around 60-70 days, I would be able to download all of my data from my Google Drive. Is this a viable solution? Would Google be flexible enough to agree to this with me only continuing to pay $27 per month?      Additionally, I found it impossible to directly contact Google with regard to this. When I click the help button in the Admin Console as shown below, I am always directed to a chatbot but am unable to talk to a real human being. Does anyone know how I could directly reach out to a Google personnel and ask for extension?  Admin ConsoleSolution 2:    Simply adding more users on a temporary basis. I heard some rumors saying that when you have 5 users (currently I only have one) in your Google Workspace, you are kind of treated differently. While I know there is no way that by having 5 users I would be granted 200 TB space, all I need is to stop the imminent deletion of my data. If adding to 5 users can grant me some status and put a stop to the suspension, I could just afford to pay 5-user fee for 2 more months and transfer all my data locally and then I could just cancel them altogether and say goodbye to Google. Does anyone know whether this approach would work? As the notice from Google claimed that "If you take no action your account will be suspended.", I am wondering whether adding to 5 users would count as "some action" and at least stop the imminent deletion of all my data on June 22, 2024...

Some backstory: I had an unfortunate ssd failure which cost me about $1000 to recover the files. After some research I've decided to set up a NAS w/ RAID1 (and other back up methods). Now I have some questions to help me transition/transfer/migration from my old external hdd setup to my NAS solution.      My first question mainly revolves around keeping file integrity when transferring files. What programs are best at doing this? I've done some research and I've currently chosen TeraCopy. It looks pretty good; other posts have suggested stuff like Robocopy but I couldn't find/get it to work (maybe it's command line stuff that, though I admittedly didn't look too hard since I don't trust inbuilt windows stuff that much). How good is TeraCopy and its file integrity verification?      My second question is about checking files for corruption, mainly videos. This one is a bit of a shot in the dark, a hail mary hope of mine that I can fix this headache inducing rookie mistake of mine. Long story short, I had to reinitialize my NAS due to changing its setup. When doing this, I copied data I had on the NAS to a ext HDD (no verification done, I now know it was a stupid rookie mistake) totaling approx 3.5 TB of data, mainly video files (probably around 1k hours). Now I found at least 1 of them has a bit of corruption, where about 20 seconds got messed up. Is there a way or program that can find these kind of problems with files? I'm guessing probably not, but if there are potential solutions I'd love to find them. Otherwise, I guess those errors/problems will just exist and years later I'll find out and lament that if I knew years ago I could have replaced those files but not when I do.      Thanks for your help and I'll reply if I have any follow up questions.</Content></post><post><Title>What's your guys system for archiving entire youtube channels look like?</Title><Author>u/glowcialist</Author><Content>I tried TubeArchivist, and it worked great for maybe 500 vids, but now seems to be completely blocked, I'm assuming that any script utilizing yt-dlp would face similar issues?      4k tube seemed to work alright for individual playlists at first, but now seems to be consistently throttled to like 50 kb/s.

Recently by searching on Amazon US https://www.amazon.com/s?k=renewed+16TB I discovered that there's a whole world of renewed hard drives sold at perhaps around half of the price of new per same amount of TB!! Woah! 16TB starts at $139!      I used to buy so many external (I have a bunch of 8TBs) Seagate (probably all are shingled magnetic recording based?) USB3 hard drives, but these renewed Enterprise hard drives seem so much better performing, way cheaper than even cheapest USB3 externals, and I would hope all decently usable to build a future NAS I am envisioning.. !!      Here are some places that sell these renewed hard drives as I have found:  https://serverpartdeals.com/ (they seem to have 2-year warranty WD Ultrastar and etc) with $40 worldwide shipping (free 2-day shipping in the USA)  https://www.goharddrive.com/category-s/293.htm (under this renewed HDD brand "MaxDigitalData" which can also be found on Amazon US)      Some Ebay sellers such as these:  https://www.ebay.com/str/eastdigital out of Hong Kong with free shipping worldwide or $20 expedited worldwide shipping  https://www.ebay.com/str/goharddrivewholesaleandretail (perhaps they have more or different drives on their ebay than on their website?)  https://www.ebay.com/str/dbskyusa88    Which of these or other sellers have you tried and can you recommend? As many of them seem to say they provide 2-year, 3-year even 5-year "Warranty from the Reseller", one might want to buy from a reseller that seems to have many reviews and a longer history to hopefully still be around if one or other of these hard drives stop working within the 2, 3 or 5-year warranty..      Although it might sound scary to buy a hard drive that might have already run 26 thousand hours or more (if it has already run for 3 years or so constantly in these data centers), coming out of a cloud storage provider who for one reason or other needs to sell or to replace their storage drives periodically, I would think:      That these renewed hard drives might have actually been tested way more than new hard drives, and since the resellers test them before selling them, it means they're probably still fine, so who knows, they might have a better chance of lasting a further many years compared with buying a new hard drive off the market? Especially since my future NAS or just USB enclosure backup usage would be much less heavy in usage compared with the usage they've had in the datacenters until being sold for renewed.      I go to check Backblaze's Hard drive tests https://www.backblaze.com/cloud-storage/resources/hard-drive-test-data and I simply try to order those same exact hard drive model numbers that have the best reliability according to Backblaze!      Hard drive manufacturers (WD Ultrastar?) advertise something like 2.5 million hours of usage before an expected failure, so if they've run for about 25'000 hours in some datacenters for 3 years constantly somewhere, that's only 1% of the advertised lifetime?      Once I get my 5-bay or 6-bay or 8-bay NAS up and running (still I don't know which one I will aim for, I am looking through second hand markets periodically), I would think, it shouldn't be a problem just swapping out any failed hard drive if that happens eventually (if still within warranty or after warranty expired), and considering Renewed hard drives are sold at half the price of new! If I eventually have 10% of my renewed hard drives fail (sooner than new hard drives fail, which I am unsure if one should expect), it might still be 2x cheaper per TB than buying all these hard drives as new!</Content></post><post><Title>Starting data hording journey</Title><Author>u/nlj1978</Author><Content>After the help I got here on ripping my cd collection I'm jumping in the deep end.

It has since also been upgraded to the latest firmware from LSI/Broadcom, which is 12.15.0-0239 (also the card at boot identifies as BIOS version "3.30.02.2 (Build June 17, 2014)"). I am just simply using it in my Windows 10 system, not as part of a server or NAS.      This card had been disconnected from my system for about 6-12 months, as well as it's drives, I recently reconnected everything in a new system. I have four HDDs in a RAID5, but had recently acquired the license key to enable RAID6 and had installed a 5th HDD in preparation for that. I had a few errors at first, but many things in the system were at first giving me errors so I didn't think much of it as I had performed several upgrades and changes at once.      I eventually got everything booting properly and then opened up the RAID Windows management software (Version 17.05.02.01 at the time) and it seemed to be going ok. It was performing a Patrol Read on all of my drives and was recharging the battery (Though it claimed the battery was bad, but it was new, so I figured it needed to do a recharge cycle and re-learn to see it as good again). It said the Patrol Read was only going to take 10 minutes but I knew it was going to take hours. Halfway in, at about the 3-4 hour mark, the software completely stopped responding. I restarted it, and now the card was showing that absolutely nothing was installed to it.      I performed a reboot and now I kept getting an error message during the card's initialization during post:      LSI MegaRAID SAS-MFI BIOS Version 3.30.02.2 (Build June 17, 2014) Copyright(c) 2014 LSI Corporation Host Adapter Bus 5 Dev 0:      F/W is in Fault State MFI Register State 0xF0010002      Adapter at Baseport is not responding      No MegaRAID Adapter Installed      The card then could be seen as installed, but the drives were not showing up, and the management software could not even tell a card was installed anymore. I tried updating to the latest management software (17.05.06.00) in case it might at least see there is a card installed, with that being it's own can of worms of expecting me to manually install OpenJDK and set the environment paths myself, it also just gets stuck loading the application.      I tried MegaCLI, StorCLI, and MegaSCU (I admit I am not too familiar with managing this card through a CLI) but -v and -AdpAllInfo -aALL but they all returned nothing. I tried disconnecting the drives in case one had somehow become so fault during storage that it was crashing it, and no difference. I tried the only other PCI socket in my motherboard and it would not even boot then, guess that socket isn't even working with everything else installed in my system.      I have no idea what to do now. The card refuses to work, claiming it's suffering some kind of firmware fault on POST, none of the software seems to even detect the presence of the card at all despite it physically showing up in Device Manager (although with an "An I/O adapter hardware error has occurred." error) and HWiNFO, and I am not aware of any way I can attempt a force-reflash of the firmware in case it's a software issue (although I somehow doubt it) or of what else to try.      And yes, I have a backup of my data.</Content></post><post><Title>Ibms first commercially available 5mb ramac's disk storage 1956</Title><Author>u/noideawhatimdoing444</Author><Content>No content</Content></post><post><Title>Twitter is silently deleting some suspended accounts which has not been logged in for some time.</Title><Author>u/cyberanakinvader</Author><Content>I think I've made a disturbing discovery regarding Twitter where they have silently deleted some suspended accounts which has not been logged in for some time, including some of mine.

Some backstory: I had an unfortunate ssd failure which cost me about $1000 to recover the files. After some research I've decided to set up a NAS w/ RAID1 (and other back up methods). Now I have some questions to help me transition/transfer/migration from my old external hdd setup to my NAS solution.      My first question mainly revolves around keeping file integrity when transferring files. What programs are best at doing this? I've done some research and I've currently chosen TeraCopy. It looks pretty good; other posts have suggested stuff like Robocopy but I couldn't find/get it to work (maybe it's command line stuff that, though I admittedly didn't look too hard since I don't trust inbuilt windows stuff that much). How good is TeraCopy and its file integrity verification?      My second question is about checking files for corruption, mainly videos. This one is a bit of a shot in the dark, a hail mary hope of mine that I can fix this headache inducing rookie mistake of mine. Long story short, I had to reinitialize my NAS due to changing its setup. When doing this, I copied data I had on the NAS to a ext HDD (no verification done, I now know it was a stupid rookie mistake) totaling approx 3.5 TB of data, mainly video files (probably around 1k hours). Now I found at least 1 of them has a bit of corruption, where about 20 seconds got messed up. Is there a way or program that can find these kind of problems with files? I'm guessing probably not, but if there are potential solutions I'd love to find them. Otherwise, I guess those errors/problems will just exist and years later I'll find out and lament that if I knew years ago I could have replaced those files but not when I do.

As many of them seem to say they provide 2-year, 3-year even 5-year "Warranty from the Reseller", one might want to buy from a reseller that seems to have many reviews and a longer history to hopefully still be around if one or other of these hard drives stop working within the 2, 3 or 5-year warranty..      Although it might sound scary to buy a hard drive that might have already run 26 thousand hours or more (if it has already run for 3 years or so constantly in these data centers), coming out of a cloud storage provider who for one reason or other needs to sell or to replace their storage drives periodically, I would think:      That these renewed hard drives might have actually been tested way more than new hard drives, and since the resellers test them before selling them, it means they're probably still fine, so who knows, they might have a better chance of lasting a further many years compared with buying a new hard drive off the market? Especially since my future NAS or just USB enclosure backup usage would be much less heavy in usage compared with the usage they've had in the datacenters until being sold for renewed.      I go to check Backblaze's Hard drive tests https://www.backblaze.com/cloud-storage/resources/hard-drive-test-data and I simply try to order those same exact hard drive model numbers that have the best reliability according to Backblaze!      Hard drive manufacturers (WD Ultrastar?) advertise something like 2.5 million hours of usage before an expected failure, so if they've run for about 25'000 hours in some datacenters for 3 years constantly somewhere, that's only 1% of the advertised lifetime?      Once I get my 5-bay or 6-bay or 8-bay NAS up and running (still I don't know which one I will aim for, I am looking through second hand markets periodically), I would think, it shouldn't be a problem just swapping out any failed hard drive if that happens eventually (if still within warranty or after warranty expired), and considering Renewed hard drives are sold at half the price of new! If I eventually have 10% of my renewed hard drives fail (sooner than new hard drives fail, which I am unsure if one should expect), it might still be 2x cheaper per TB than buying all these hard drives as new!</Content></post><post><Title>Starting data hording journey</Title><Author>u/nlj1978</Author><Content>After the help I got here on ripping my cd collection I'm jumping in the deep end. I'm putting together a media server. Have a HP z1 G5 tower workstation with i5-9500 on the way but still have decisions to make in terms of hardware and software.      I'm finding mixed data on ECC ram support. Apparently the motherboards come in a couple variations. Once I confirm I believe I believe ECC is a better choice for this application. Still need to verify but I believe the board supports either 64 or 128gig.  That said how much ram should I use?      Mobo has 2 m2 slots and 4 sata ports. Computer comes with a 256g nvme. I've read a little about using m2 Intel Optane drives for improved server performance. Anyone have any experience or input on this?      Drives I'm still pondering.

It has since also been upgraded to the latest firmware from LSI/Broadcom, which is 12.15.0-0239 (also the card at boot identifies as BIOS version "3.30.02.2 (Build June 17, 2014)"). I am just simply using it in my Windows 10 system, not as part of a server or NAS.      This card had been disconnected from my system for about 6-12 months, as well as it's drives, I recently reconnected everything in a new system. I have four HDDs in a RAID5, but had recently acquired the license key to enable RAID6 and had installed a 5th HDD in preparation for that. I had a few errors at first, but many things in the system were at first giving me errors so I didn't think much of it as I had performed several upgrades and changes at once.      I eventually got everything booting properly and then opened up the RAID Windows management software (Version 17.05.02.01 at the time) and it seemed to be going ok. It was performing a Patrol Read on all of my drives and was recharging the battery (Though it claimed the battery was bad, but it was new, so I figured it needed to do a recharge cycle and re-learn to see it as good again). It said the Patrol Read was only going to take 10 minutes but I knew it was going to take hours. Halfway in, at about the 3-4 hour mark, the software completely stopped responding. I restarted it, and now the card was showing that absolutely nothing was installed to it.      I performed a reboot and now I kept getting an error message during the card's initialization during post:      LSI MegaRAID SAS-MFI BIOS Version 3.30.02.2 (Build June 17, 2014) Copyright(c) 2014 LSI Corporation Host Adapter Bus 5 Dev 0:      F/W is in Fault State MFI Register State 0xF0010002      Adapter at Baseport is not responding      No MegaRAID Adapter Installed      The card then could be seen as installed, but the drives were not showing up, and the management software could not even tell a card was installed anymore. I tried updating to the latest management software (17.05.06.00) in case it might at least see there is a card installed, with that being it's own can of worms of expecting me to manually install OpenJDK and set the environment paths myself, it also just gets stuck loading the application.      I tried MegaCLI, StorCLI, and MegaSCU (I admit I am not too familiar with managing this card through a CLI) but -v and -AdpAllInfo -aALL but they all returned nothing. I tried disconnecting the drives in case one had somehow become so fault during storage that it was crashing it, and no difference. I tried the only other PCI socket in my motherboard and it would not even boot then, guess that socket isn't even working with everything else installed in my system.      I have no idea what to do now. The card refuses to work, claiming it's suffering some kind of firmware fault on POST, none of the software seems to even detect the presence of the card at all despite it physically showing up in Device Manager (although with an "An I/O adapter hardware error has occurred." error) and HWiNFO, and I am not aware of any way I can attempt a force-reflash of the firmware in case it's a software issue (although I somehow doubt it) or of what else to try.      And yes, I have a backup of my data.</Content></post><post><Title>Ibms first commercially available 5mb ramac's disk storage 1956</Title><Author>u/noideawhatimdoing444</Author><Content>No content</Content></post><post><Title>Twitter is silently deleting some suspended accounts which has not been logged in for some time.</Title><Author>u/cyberanakinvader</Author><Content>I think I've made a disturbing discovery regarding Twitter where they have silently deleted some suspended accounts which has not been logged in for some time, including some of mine.

I have a Lenovo M600 on a 1GB home network (could be upgraded to be fair...), its running home assistant, Plex, the arr suit for downloading media and I would like to replace dropbox/google drive and ICloud with nextCloud or similar.      Currently, given the small form factor, I have a 2TB SSD (already 75% full) and a 500GB M.2, running the OS. Currently there is no backup (at the moment this is not super terrible, nothing is that important... yet!).      I would like to increase this storage and add backup. I am not super worried about 3-2-1 coverage, but definitely a nightly backup of everything would be good especially when we move away from the cloud storage suppliers for our photos etc.      So what is the best option:      Replace SSD with a 4TB (£225), add a 6TB (£120) external USB drive and manage nightly backups. This is cheapest, but least long lasting the 2TB filled up fast and I expect even going to 4TB will not be enough longer term.      Get a 2 bay USB3 external caddy (£50-150???) and add 2 x 8TB drives (£270). Use this as both primary media storage and secondary backup (assume this is not advised? Whats the view of applications like plex running over USB storage...?).

Essentially:      Performant enough to replace the phone's gallery app in day-to-day use      Syncing ability (either self-hosted or Cloud-based), including some kind of selective sync, e.g. to keep enough images local to fill a certain amount of space, but automatically remove old ones locally if you take new ones      Sync albums      Offline support (at least for those that are synced locally)      Support of Android, Windows, and Mac OS X (or Web-based for non-mobile)      Does anyone know of an app that supports all of that?

Currently, given the small form factor, I have a 2TB SSD (already 75% full) and a 500GB M.2, running the OS. Currently there is no backup (at the moment this is not super terrible, nothing is that important... yet!).      I would like to increase this storage and add backup. I am not super worried about 3-2-1 coverage, but definitely a nightly backup of everything would be good especially when we move away from the cloud storage suppliers for our photos etc.      So what is the best option:      Replace SSD with a 4TB (£225), add a 6TB (£120) external USB drive and manage nightly backups. This is cheapest, but least long lasting the 2TB filled up fast and I expect even going to 4TB will not be enough longer term.      Get a 2 bay USB3 external caddy (£50-150???) and add 2 x 8TB drives (£270). Use this as both primary media storage and secondary backup (assume this is not advised? Whats the view of applications like plex running over USB storage...?).      Just go with a NAS, in which case id go with a 4 bay something £??? open to suggestions here, 2x8TB £270, in which case it feels the M600 is mostly redundant, i expect this is also the most expensive option.      better cheaper and all round wonderful thing I have not thought of?

I made the mistake of choosing a case that only has as many drives that I had, so wanted to do it right this time. Use case is TrueNas with some apps, running on Ryzen 5700G to optimize for idle power consumption.      I don't yet have a rack, but will be getting one when I move. Hence, I shortlisted some 4U rackmounts to place vertically first on a shelf:  Logic case sc-4316: US$350, 16 drives  Sliger CX4712 : US$399, 12 drives. I'm leaning towards this      These 4u cases aren't available for me locally - so estimated shipping to get either of those is an extra US$200, though I'm trying to find out if I can reduce that somehow.      On the other hand,, a tower like the Fractal Meshify 2 (US$150) is much cheaper, and available to me locally, so I don't have to pay much for shipping. I could get 3 of these with the money needed to get the 4U.      In this situation, are there enough advantages of those 4U cases to justify the extra expense? If I get a rack, I think I could place the Meshify 2 on its side on a shelf so that it only takes 6U.      I'm new to rackmounted chassis, so these are the pros and cons I'm weighing, let me know if I missed anything.      Pros:      Support for redundant PSUs, hot swappable fans and drives for less uptime in case of a failure      Support for larger motherboards: I currently have an ATX, not sure how useful support for larger form factors would be if I upgrade to lower end server boards      Designed for rack mounting, smaller footprint      Cons:      Expensive      Requires fan swaps for silence      Higher drive temperatures?

Anything in here is stuff I gathered up from reading some posts.      My current storage setup is almost non existant. Most important things are simply "backed up" multiple times manually on each random drive I have on a couple of PCs, with some data on OneDrive and GDrive.      So long story short, I need a main NAS mainly for a redundancy QOL (better late than never):      Single place where I can upload all my data, as currently it's heavily scattered and duplicated.      I want the data to be synced to other endpoints automatically for backup:      NAS in another location as additional backup, not used for anything else. Probably simple two bay 2x16TB - and probably RAID 1. Don't have one yet, will most likely setup once I get this one going.      16TB drive on my second PC, as another backup      Locally encrypting files before cloud syncing. Only important files, so about ~1-2TB. Probably OneDrive, since I already have some space there and potentially one other in the future, like blackbaze. (heard about rclone, not sure if this is good or there are better alternatives).      Two seperate external 8TB drives for important data and p4/git only, with manual syncing once a month or two, alterneting between the drives (just a failsafe in case of corrupted data being synced to other endpoints)      Local Perforce / Git servers ~2TB (later on, I'll be making seperate server for that, so it's just for a year, maybe two).      The Data:      Most important files ~1-2TB (mostly personal photos/videos/docs). These files will be rarely accessed. Once I get them all sorted into a single location, I was thinking of burning them on BD-R disks.      Other files to sync - ~3TB      Random stuff that I don't care for loosing, few TBs, no syncing to other endpoints.      Files will be uploaded to the NAS manually (e.g. when dumping photos from my phone).      My main need is redundancy and potentially ensuring I don't sync corrupted files to other endpoints (so some kind of checksums when uploading stuff to the NAS and prevent syncing corrupted ones).

My Yottamaster RAID started becoming unstable and was beeping all the time, so after giving up on it, I bought a Logitech enclosure and put the drives in, creating a RAID 5 volume with SoftRaid 8.      After I got everything set up, of my disks disappeared from the new RAID, and as I was verifying the other three, another one gave me issues. So I decided to format the "new" disks and try again. I seem to have had one of the volumes in my old (backup) RAID selected, and erased it.      The backup RAID was, I think, set up as two striped RAID volumes, which were then striped together to create a raid of that. This might not be the best way to do a RAID, but there was no option other than striped or mirrored disks, and at the time SoftRaid was not working with Apple Silicon at all.      I have bought a large external disk to serve as a working disk to hopefully save my data. Can anyone suggest what will happen when I use the Restore option in Disk Utilities?

I am more comfortable running two 2x3TB raid 1 array, since then I know that the data is formatted such that I can fetch it without rebuilding.  Even asustor themselves does not have a method of recovering the data from an raid 5 array. I have been using snapraid before, and that is has been feeling more safe, as  when a drive has failed, only the data on that drive has potentially been lost.      Am I paranoid and recovering from raid 5 data loss not that troublesome? can you recover data from a single drive that is from a raid 5 array?</Content></post><post><Title>Just started VHS digitizing.

I made the mistake of choosing a case that only has as many drives that I had, so wanted to do it right this time. Use case is TrueNas with some apps, running on Ryzen 5700G to optimize for idle power consumption.      I don't yet have a rack, but will be getting one when I move. Hence, I shortlisted some 4U rackmounts to place vertically first on a shelf:  Logic case sc-4316: US$350, 16 drives  Sliger CX4712 : US$399, 12 drives. I'm leaning towards this      These 4u cases aren't available for me locally - so estimated shipping to get either of those is an extra US$200, though I'm trying to find out if I can reduce that somehow.      On the other hand,, a tower like the Fractal Meshify 2 (US$150) is much cheaper, and available to me locally, so I don't have to pay much for shipping. I could get 3 of these with the money needed to get the 4U.      In this situation, are there enough advantages of those 4U cases to justify the extra expense? If I get a rack, I think I could place the Meshify 2 on its side on a shelf so that it only takes 6U.      I'm new to rackmounted chassis, so these are the pros and cons I'm weighing, let me know if I missed anything.      Pros:      Support for redundant PSUs, hot swappable fans and drives for less uptime in case of a failure      Support for larger motherboards: I currently have an ATX, not sure how useful support for larger form factors would be if I upgrade to lower end server boards      Designed for rack mounting, smaller footprint      Cons:      Expensive      Requires fan swaps for silence      Higher drive temperatures? I assume drive temps would be worse compared to e.g, the meshify      Won't fit my 160 mm cooler      Thanks for reading!</Content></post><post><Title>What is the best software for testing a drives reads and writes until failure (RAID 5 with Windows)</Title><Author>u/Appropriate_Face8497</Author><Content>I have a RAID 5 configuration on a windows system and I would like to see how many reads and writes it will take for me to kill one of the drives in the configuration.

Anything in here is stuff I gathered up from reading some posts.      My current storage setup is almost non existant. Most important things are simply "backed up" multiple times manually on each random drive I have on a couple of PCs, with some data on OneDrive and GDrive.      So long story short, I need a main NAS mainly for a redundancy QOL (better late than never):      Single place where I can upload all my data, as currently it's heavily scattered and duplicated.      I want the data to be synced to other endpoints automatically for backup:      NAS in another location as additional backup, not used for anything else. Probably simple two bay 2x16TB - and probably RAID 1. Don't have one yet, will most likely setup once I get this one going.      16TB drive on my second PC, as another backup      Locally encrypting files before cloud syncing. Only important files, so about ~1-2TB. Probably OneDrive, since I already have some space there and potentially one other in the future, like blackbaze. (heard about rclone, not sure if this is good or there are better alternatives).      Two seperate external 8TB drives for important data and p4/git only, with manual syncing once a month or two, alterneting between the drives (just a failsafe in case of corrupted data being synced to other endpoints)      Local Perforce / Git servers ~2TB (later on, I'll be making seperate server for that, so it's just for a year, maybe two).      The Data:      Most important files ~1-2TB (mostly personal photos/videos/docs). These files will be rarely accessed. Once I get them all sorted into a single location, I was thinking of burning them on BD-R disks.      Other files to sync - ~3TB      Random stuff that I don't care for loosing, few TBs, no syncing to other endpoints.      Files will be uploaded to the NAS manually (e.g. when dumping photos from my phone).      My main need is redundancy and potentially ensuring I don't sync corrupted files to other endpoints (so some kind of checksums when uploading stuff to the NAS and prevent syncing corrupted ones). Warning when corrupted files are detected would be great.      I don't need much speed in day to day operations (not sure if it's needed by the NAS itself in case of drive failure). Other than P4/Git, all data will be accessed very rarely (maybe a couple times a year).

Any better ways?</Content></post><post><Title>11 years ago I built a computer</Title><Author>u/BinaryPatrickDev</Author><Content>No content</Content></post><post><Title>Does this Buffalo Linksys NAS  have encryption?</Title><Author>u/zemaacu001</Author><Content>Help me data pros. I am have Link Station Buffalo NAS. LS220D0402B. Does this encrypt data inside? I don't know anything about NAS.      I googled and found a post saying linksys doesn't support encryption, but TeraStation device does, but it seemed like an old post and I wasn't sure if it included my model.      I didn't start using it yet since I don't think it encrypts data. If someone physically steals device, I think the data in device is vulnerable. Am I correct in thinking this? Is there anything I can do to encrypt it or would I have to buy a NAS that automatically encrypts the data?</Content></post><post><Title>Document Scanning Services</Title><Author>u/JL4575</Author><Content>I’m looking to scan a small collection of magazines, more than I want to manage manually.

It is currently running G-RAID's hardware RAID at RAID 0 and I want to redeploy it for another purpose and make it RAID 1.  It is not mission critical and I'll be backing it up to another local location and to the cloud so if it craps out, it won't be the end of the world.

It sounds like RAID-5 isn't the best since they SSDs are over 3TB; haven't fully confirmed this, just something I've read (LTT used it on this setup though). RAID-Z sounds like the best option so far, but only allows for 1 drive failure and I don't really see me utilizing &amp;gt;8TB anytime in the near future. Because of this, I'm wondering if I should start with RAID-10, and adjust/recreate the configuration to RAID-6 and then/or RAID-Z later on?
