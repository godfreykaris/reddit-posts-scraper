I'm already hearing about how Arab-Americans are either going to pass on voting or vote for a third party, which, in my opinion, is what they should absolutely do, since this is taking initiative in moving against the status quo of the \"lEsSeR oF tHe TwO eViLs\" narrative. If (and a big IF) Trump wins, I'll consider this America's punishment for not abandoning the current dogma."

    "post_content": "What differentiates Socialists from Reactionaries? In many cases, it’s not the general problems pointed out in society (ex: not having money, not having power, feeling alienated in your community), its the solutions. It’s the end goals (ex: Building an equitable and highly democratic society vs building a genocidal ethnostate).\nWe hear day in and day out about the problems caused by capitalism. So much so that it can have a negative impact on our mental health. The inevitable question is “what do we do about them?”\nIf you don’t ground your organizing in what solutions you are seeking to build, all that you are left with is railing against the problems in society with no hardened commitment to a just and Socialist outcome. Not only can this end up having a negative impact on the effectiveness of your messaging and the morale of organizers, it can allow reactionary solutions to slowly and insidiously seep into your movement and organizations. Do not forget about the historical phenomenon of fascists co-opting leftist messaging and talking points.\nGrounding your organizing in Socialist solutions, and in building the better world of tomorrow allows for strategic focus. It allows you to tailor your messaging to specific goals. It allows you to build actual programs to address issues. And most of all, it allows us to grow hope and not despair."

Surely organizations need someone more skilled, more experienced, and ready to take charge right?\nWrong.\nOrganizations aren’t looking for the next Lenin to step up. What organizations need is individuals to step up and fill a role. Each person just needs to fill one. There is something that you can volunteer your time to and if you make that “your thing” and show up consistently to help with that one thing, then you are doing organizing correctly.\nHere are small tasks that organizations, political parties, and mutual aid collectives need routine help with:\nData entry\nResearch\nFood prep\nFood and donations distribution (driving it and dropping it off)\nWriting (statements, announcements, etc)\nDoor knocking"

    "post_content": "Never say you are “fighting to build Socialism or Communism.”\nThe definition of what those mean already differs among leftists, nevermind when speaking with a liberal, conservative, a-political person, etc.\nThe only responses you will get are those that are equally as broad and typically in the form of thought terminating cliches such as “Socialism has never worked”, “Socialism is against human nature”, “Socialism is tyranny” etc.\nSpeak in terms of specific policy areas that make up Socialism.\nSay you are fighting for economic democracy, or more specifically co-op arrangements, unions, worker representation in Government, etc..\nSay you are fighting for security of well being or specifically policies to ensure everyone has housing, to ensure everyone has food.\nThese are harder for people to have knee jerk responses for, and are easier to defend with everyday or “realistic” sounding examples and specific research."

    "post_content": "As a hobby, I've been running a Discord Server which is mostly centered around recreational gaming with other Communists/Socialists/Friends since 2016 on and in speaking the truth; I am to find some sources for promoting our server in order to find some new people who would be interested in playing, conversing, or even checking out some of our promoted streamers. So I was wondering if it would be alright if I could do a self promo here on occasion since our server is over 200+ members and we're looking for cool new people to play games with & chat it up about politics, memes, art, etc.; with other cool people & comrades!\nThough I didn't wanna step in here and just do a self promo without some confirmation from the modstaff first. So it'll be much appreciated if someone could inform me about the rules regarding self/other promotional content here, thanks!\nP.S. I am Marxist-Leninist & the Juche is beautiful, I heavily enforce rules against hate speech within and outside of the server of our members, and yes we do manually screen people's applications before admitting them into the rest of the server."

    "post_content": "To those recently graduated high schoolers heading toward college, or to those freshman still deciding their majors:\nOn almost every college campus, leftist circles are concentrated among the various Social Science majors. This isn’t a bad thing and it’s logical, leftists have a keen interest in studying society and how to make it better in the macro-sense.\nBut we need more Socialists in the other majors and trade disciplines as well. As unions begin to become revitalized across the service sector and into the trades, our businesses, our offices, and all the regular everyday industries, we need Socialists among their fellow workers ranks to push forward class consciousness. In order to do this we need leftists on campuses spread across all majors, talking with their fellow students in order to develop class consciousness and showing that their so called-apolitical majors have a lot to gain from a leftist perspective.\nIf a degree outside of the social sciences is of interest to you, don’t hesitate to pursue it. You can still get your fill of social sciences and leftist education on campus by pursuing a minor or joining or forming a leftist organization on your campus.\nAlso, to those who are not going to college because you can’t afford to or simply don’t want to, your leftism is equally as important and you are essential as well to building class consciousness in whatever fields you pursue as well."

    "post_content": "I love my theory and political driven discussion with comrades who I know I agree with. But outside of my Socialist sphere, in the workplace and among family and friends I work with a whole host of other people. Some conservative. Some liberal. Some progressive. And I like to get into political conversations with each of them and there is one universal theme I get:\nDon’t be an ass.\nNo one wants to feel like they are being scolded or yelled at for having the wrong opinion. People are terrified of being yelled at for “having the wrong opinion” and are wary of the stereotype of the angry leftist that they saw on the fear mongering news.\nNow for the case of the average worker who isn’t a die hard far right reactionary, does that mean you should just let them say problematic things? No.\nBut it does mean you should respond to them slowly and thoughtfully. Ask them why they think what they do. The vast majority aren’t saying what they are out of some deep understanding of the issue. They haven’t read liberal or conservative “theory”. They are rehashing something they saw on the news that they think meshes with their values of being a good person. When someone thinks that you are both intelligent on a subject and respectful, they will want to hear more of your side in the future. That’s how you open pathways to radicalizing your “a-political” or moderate coworkers and friends and family.\nIf we want to organize the masses we have to be among the masses of non-socialists. We have to educate them. And like very good teacher, we meet them where they are at respectfully and as fellow proletarians to pull them over to our side over time."
