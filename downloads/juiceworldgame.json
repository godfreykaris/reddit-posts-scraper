You only get older and before you know it, you're lying on your death bed, losing everything you earned; your friends, your relationships, your belongings, everything. We will die, but we don't know when or how.

(the reason you don't click too fast is because if your energy is low enough, the pineapple will cost you energy without firing.) the creator can't walk or spawn pollywogs while being damaged, as this stunlocks him for some reason. once the creator's dead, immediately fly off for the juice portal (near where you landed) and go through. you can't drink the creator's juice, since you didn't get vampirized by batty. even if you could, it would be much too slow and you'd only get a few hundred juice.\n-Slitherss-\nthe creator should've given you about 3000 juice, so spend an amount of juice that feels right on flight (i've never once counted) and MAKE SURE TO GET 5 MAX HEALTH. 5 regen is optional, in fact i'm probably gonna stop and not recommend it, since it's such a short fight that it likely won't need it. getting some damage is recommended, though you'll have some damage upgrades from pre-creator. so if you have juice left over from the flight and energy regen upgrades, spend it on damage. otherwise, just fly straight up from the graveyard until you find the planet with a rainbow halo/aura. once you're up to the right sphere, you can tell with side to go to based off of which direction the fountain sphere is in. then, just go in, land on the school, and spam pineapples at slitherss. it's recommended you learn a method of fast clicking, i recommend butterfly clicking. easy to learn, hard to master. works well if used well. once you've spammed out a few pineapples at slitherss, she'll laser blast you. just resist this, and follow her to wherever the pineapples push her to. you should be able to kill her before/not long after dialogue ends. once you do that, your winner.",

You only get older and before you know it, you're lying on your death bed, losing everything you earned; your friends, your relationships, your belongings, everything. We will die, but we don't know when or how. We just know we have to make the most of it.\nMy theory for the lifeless ragdoll in the room stitches so many things that just seem to fit right in place.\nA second theory could also be that it's a joke, and I'm reading way too much into this.",

(the reason you don't click too fast is because if your energy is low enough, the pineapple will cost you energy without firing.) the creator can't walk or spawn pollywogs while being damaged, as this stunlocks him for some reason. once the creator's dead, immediately fly off for the juice portal (near where you landed) and go through. you can't drink the creator's juice, since you didn't get vampirized by batty. even if you could, it would be much too slow and you'd only get a few hundred juice.\n-Slitherss-\nthe creator should've given you about 3000 juice, so spend an amount of juice that feels right on flight (i've never once counted) and MAKE SURE TO GET 5 MAX HEALTH. 5 regen is optional, in fact i'm probably gonna stop and not recommend it, since it's such a short fight that it likely won't need it. getting some damage is recommended, though you'll have some damage upgrades from pre-creator. so if you have juice left over from the flight and energy regen upgrades, spend it on damage. otherwise, just fly straight up from the graveyard until you find the planet with a rainbow halo/aura. once you're up to the right sphere, you can tell with side to go to based off of which direction the fountain sphere is in. then, just go in, land on the school, and spam pineapples at slitherss. it's recommended you learn a method of fast clicking, i recommend butterfly clicking. easy to learn, hard to master. works well if used well. once you've spammed out a few pineapples at slitherss, she'll laser blast you. just resist this, and follow her to wherever the pineapples push her to. you should be able to kill her before/not long after dialogue ends. once you do that, your winner.",

However it's always fun to max flight speed and flyby one-shot stroll fiends by lodging your morningstar in their foreheads like a badass.\n(can we please start a trend of way overanalyzing the combat? Shit sounds hilarious considering what actually happens in the game)",
