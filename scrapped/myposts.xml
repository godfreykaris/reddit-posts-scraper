I‚Äôm curious, genuinely and from a good place, what‚Äôs the longest relationship you‚Äôve been in? Would you consider your current relationship a real love? How many relationships HAVE you been in?      Peace be unto you all.

I‚Äôve finished chemo 2 1/2 months ago, and I‚Äôve just now started to look a bit more like a human being, lol.      Seeing how I looked over the past few months breaks my heart, honestly. I wasn‚Äôt doing too bad physically all things considered, but holy shit, I looked like I was from a different species at times. Deep bags under my eyes, blue lips, yellow skin, bald, eyebrows gone‚Ä¶ picture a naked mole rat on the brink of death and yeah, that‚Äôs exactly what I looked like at times.      And yet, my boyfriend constantly made me feel like the sun shined out of my bald ass. Frankly speaking, I have no idea how we have managed to have an active sex life while I was going through treatment, but he didn‚Äôt make it look difficult at all.      Mind you, this is not a long relationship: I am 23, he‚Äôs 25, and we‚Äôve been together for just a bit over 6 months now. We‚Äôve met while I was going through treatment: I never would‚Äôve started a relationship in those circumstances, but he made it seem like the easiest, most natural thing. He has known about my condition from the very start, and he has never been intimidated by it. If anything, I feel like it makes him love me even more.      My last boyfriend broke up with me due to cancer, so this is such a huge deal for me. He takes care of me with such kindness and patience, I don‚Äôt know how he does it. He has never made me feel like a burden in the slightest. Whenever I feel bad, either physically or mentally, he just showers me with a seemingly infinite supply of love and care.      I can‚Äôt believe I am lucky enough to have someone like him in my life. Staying alive is so hard at times, but it becomes easy when I think of those in my life who want me to stay alive. If my cancer ever recurs, I‚Äôll take any treatment with a smile on my face for more time with those I love, him especially. With how hard it‚Äôs been at times, I feel like staying alive and sane is the biggest act of love I have to give.      I didn‚Äôt think men like him existed, especially after my last boyfriend - but they do. If any of you reading this ever feel like you‚Äôre too much for anyone to love, take me as living (for now, LOL) proof that there‚Äôs someone out there for you. The right person will think that what was ‚Äútoo much‚Äù for someone else is just right for them.</Content></post><post><Title>I miss you all the time. Please let me love you again.</Title><Author>u/Watchguy336</Author><Content>I miss you so much. I think about you constantly - when a song comes on that we listened to, in doing the activities we enjoyed together, in the quiet moments before I go to sleep when my chest just aches. Not committing to you when we were together is the biggest mistake of my life.      From the moment we met and started our relationship, happiness just seeped out of me. You made me smile, laugh, cry, FEEL, for the first time in years. We had passion, chemistry, connection, intellectual conversation, fun, mind blowing sex. Our relationship was beautiful and has so much potential to be beautiful for a long time.      You are so smart, kind, fit, happy, self aware, full of self love and love for others. You set boundaries better than any person I have ever met. All of which are aspects of you that I truly admire. I had learned, and still have so much to learn, from you. In our time together, you made me a better man, a better human, a better partner. You challenged me in so many ways - I miss this. I miss you.      I‚Äôm in love with you. There is no other way to say it. I don‚Äôt see a scenario in which that changes anytime soon.      I left M for me. I‚Äôm not drinking nearly as much as I was. I have my support system in place. I‚Äôm exercising every day. I‚Äôm in therapy.      All of these improvements can be for me and I can also have you by my side. Let me love you. Let us be together. Don‚Äôt be the one that got away.</Content></post><post><Title>How a Serendipitous Encounter with a Beautiful Woman Left a Lasting Impression</Title><Author>u/SamFendernot</Author><Content>Hey Reddit,      Tonight, something really unexpected happened while I was wandering around downtown Naples at about 9:30 pm. I just moved here and was feeling a bit nostalgic, so I decided to check out a few local restaurants to ask about job openings. I figured finding something to do at night a party from my day job would help me settle in. After a few stops, I found this place called Le Colonial, which is a cool mix of Vietnamese and French cuisine. It really caught my eye.      Inside, I met someone who really stood out. The manager‚Äîa young blonde with the most striking blue eyes I‚Äôve ever seen‚Äîinitially threw me off because I thought she was the hostess! After a quick chat, I left, but I couldn't stop thinking about her. So, 15 to 20 minutes later, I walked back in, pretending I needed a business card, but honestly, I just wanted to see her again and ask her out.      When I asked her out, she seemed pleasantly surprised and genuinely happy, even though she mentioned she had a boyfriend. Her warm smile didn‚Äôt stop me. I took the business card, smiled back, and hinted that I‚Äôd be back. Boyfriend or not, I felt a connection I couldn't ignore. Hopefully, she‚Äôs not getting married anytime soon!      I forgot to ask her name and it wasn‚Äôt on the card since she wasn‚Äôt the general manager, but I‚Äôll make sure to remember it next time. Those eyes are hard to forget!      Has anyone else had a spontaneous encounter like this? Any tips for my next visit to Le Colonial?      I‚Äôd like to build a genuine connection with this beautiful woman while also respecting boundaries. üòà you never know...      Q1: What are some subtle, respectful ways to show her I'm interested without overstepping? Q2: Has anyone successfully turned a friendly connection into something more? How did you do it? Q3: Any tips for balancing persistence with respect in situations like this?</Content></post><post><Title>I wish you knew how much I cherish and miss you</Title><Author>u/BarelyConscious_</Author><Content>I think about you constantly. Everything reminds me of you. I want to tell you about everything going on in my life; I want to hear about everything going on in yours.      I miss your smile. I miss the silly faces you'd make. I miss how you'd wink at me when you were too busy to talk, simply to acknowledge me. I miss how you'd lean into me when we stood side by side. I miss talking about music and poetry with you. I miss all the ornery things you did.      I want to know everything I can about you. All your proudest moments, your deepest regrets, your embarrassing moments. I want to know your favorite memories, everything that brings you joy. I want to know how you feel about me, who I am in your mind.      I want you to know everything about me, I want to bare myself to you. I want to tell you about my worst moments, about the person I wish to never be again. I want you to know my favorite memories and the things that make me laugh uncontrollably. I want you to know how much you mean to me, how much I care for you.      I want you to know I adore you.      I don't know when I'll see you again, or if I ever will, but I want you to know I'll always think of you with a broken heart full of love I wish I could've given you.

I have always wanted to expirience the love of a good woman. To wake up next to someone special that I know cares about me. How did you find it? How long did it take dating other people to find someone to share your life with? I never learned how to love, I was emotionally abused by my dad when I was young. He taught me how to hate myself. I'm currently working on unlearning what I learned from him. My therapist told me something I already know, that I'm not ready for a relationship. Because I'm still learning how to love myself. Most of the time, when I think about how to love myself, I have no idea what to do or where to start. Tonight, when you are cuddling with your SO, remember how truly fortunate and lucky you really are to have this.

But my new boyfriend even without meeting him knows how amazing he is and how much happier i am in this relationship and she just wants us to work and be happy. She can tell over the phone how much healthier this relationship is and it makes me so happy that she can tell how gteat he is without having met him yet.

One day while my bf and I were at my parents' house, I asked my mom to make me this "children's coffee" and my boyfriend asked me what that was and I explained the story behind it and how I used to drink it a lot when I was younger. That's where it all began.      Ffw a few weeks, we're at his mom's house and for a change there's soy milk in the fridge there (leftover from a family holiday we went on) so he asks me if I want children's coffee. Surprised, I asked him if he wanted to make it for me and he said yes. So obviously I agreed, it's a cute gesture. And it was good. Better than my mom's, even. Which is what I told him too. I guess from that point on it became his go-to act of service, because every single day when we're together he asks me if I want children's coffee, sometimes more than once a day too. Every time I say yes, because I can tell it makes him happy to make the coffees.      But here's the problem: his recipe tastes HORRIBLE with almond milk. At least the almond milk we have at my parents' house. My mom does not want soy milk in her house because of the estrogen, so this substitute is the only thing my bf could use for the coffee, but man it tastes bad. I'm talking "the flavor gives me a nauseated feeling if I drink more than half of it" kind of bad. Still, every time he prepares it for me in the morning, I force myself to drink it all. I've asked him to switch up the recipe a bit to accommodate for the different milk substitute, but it's like no matter what he does, each time it ends up tasting worse. But whenever he hands me that coffee mug with a proud smile on his face it's like he just handed me a cup of love, how could I not drink that?      There are many ways to get out of this situation. I am not afraid of being honest. I could easily tell him it just doesn't taste good with almond milk and he will not get upset. But I don't want to. I don't want him to stop doing this. It's almost like the bad flavor makes it better/sweeter? Sometimes I even consider asking him myself if he wants to make me that coffee, knowing it will taste bad. I guess that's just how love works.</Content></post><post><Title>My girlfriend‚Äôs family treats me better than my own family.</Title><Author>u/JakeOfSpades1</Author><Content>I 18m visit with my girlfriend 23f and her family and they‚Äôve treated me with absolutely kindness but my own family would insult my appearance, height, voice and anything else.

Like, I get loving someone‚Äîyou appreciate who they are, you enjoy being around them, you feel loved and safe with them etc‚Äîbut how does that differ from being in love with them ie loving them romantically not platonically? For example, your best friend vs your romantic partner, you love both of them but other than (presumably) also being sexually attracted to your partner and not to your friend (would also appreciate if anyone has advice on what that actually means, is it literally looking at someone and having a desire to have sex with them?), is there a difference in how you feel about them?      I feel like there has to be since I know that there are plenty of asexual people or people who just otherwise aren't interested in sex who still fall in love and differentiate between romantic and platonic relationships, so clearly being "in love" with someone is different than just loving them. So what does being "in love" actually feel like?</Content></post><post><Title>What would be some good date ideas for a broke intern?</Title><Author>u/lucesh1</Author><Content>So basically I have around $50 to my name until end of the month (I'm an intern so I don't get paid).

I keep thinking about having sex with other girls all the time. I used to be a womanizer before being with her, and after two years I wanna go back to it.      Sometimes I masturbate seeing other girls instagrams and thinking about other girls. We haven't had sex for a month now, Im just not in the mood to have sex with her.      I really love her and we get along but im not sexually satisfied, im just used to having sex with a lot of girls and not just one, I never cheated on her and never will. The problem is she is SUPPER attached to me, I don't wanna hurt her, she would cry a lot and financially she is not very good. We live together in a nice apartment and the lease is not finished until MAY 2025, I was thinking leaving her then which would be much easier since we can part separate ways but im just not happy, and I don't wanna be stuck in a relationship I don't want for one more year.      I don't wanna make her unhappy and her to cry but at this point I am in the relationship because of her well being and not because of mine, I can't stop thinking about finishing the relationship not even for one day for the last 4 months. I don't know what to do. If I tell her that I wanna finish and tell her to get another apartment she would not leave. She can't afford this apartment that we are living now, I can afford it even being alone. She can't, so she would need to move to a cheaper place by herself, but she wont want to finish and when she starts crying im gonna feel bad and get back with her... it happened once before, I tried leaving her but I just felt so guilty seeing her crying so I stayed.      I just wanna experience what is to be single again. Maybe Im just not made for relationships...      what should I do?help )':      TLDR: I want but I emotionally can't leave my girlfriend even though im not happy.

We hadn‚Äôt been together for very long, just a couple months, but we both knew it was very different from anything else we had experienced. We had unashamed conversations of marriage, children, homes, issues, exes, strengths, weaknesses and just what life would be like together. It felt so right, but not in a rose colored glasses way, in a very raw and vulnerable way.      One night we were at my house and we were drinking a little bit of wine, we went out to look at the stars and have a little smoke. We were in the middle of a silly conversation and he did a totally random 180 to ask me about what kind of tree growth my woods were (he works in forestry!). I laughed so hard and let the I love you I had been holding on the tip of my tongue for weeks slip. He just laughed along with me and the night continued without mention of what I said.      The next day rolls around and this part of the story gets a little confusing but I‚Äôll give the short version. Basically I had a friend who was friends with my partners ex girlfriend. That friend (m) liked to tell me(f) all the negative details of my partners past relationship. I hear another story from this friend and shoot my partner a text. (just to clarify we had been openly communicating about his previous relationship from day one prior to my friends input, as well as all of my previous relationships). I tell him that i heard more from my friend and would like to talk. He comes right over even though i was just expecting a phone call.      After we talked everything through we go outside again to let the dogs out. He starts apologizing for putting me through all of this drama because he knows it‚Äôs not really enjoyable for anyone involved. We talk a bit more and I just tell him that it‚Äôs okay, and I trust him, and that our relationship is what we make it and these things don‚Äôt have to influence us negatively, they can build us up. He says ‚ÄúI think I love you.‚Äù, and I tell him that ‚ÄúI know I love you.‚Äù‚Ä¶.      A day or two later we‚Äôre talking about it and HE NEVER HEARD MY I LOVE YOU FROM THE PREVIOUS NIGHT!!! He thought he was saying it first and I thought I had said it first.      I just find that to be the cutest thing. Neither of us were afraid of taking that first step. Everything was perfectly balanced and it makes me feel incredibly happy to think about.      He is my person.

He was forced now to work part time as well and began to reply late and he apologized saying he was busy working full time and part time.      I get that he was busy but i know him so well that i know he seems depressed although he didn't say anything to me. So, although i was not feeling it and was slightly hurt he really replies late, I still gave him a long message thanking him and letting him know i'm always here for him and that these things may have happened to him but I consoled him and told him that the Lord has better plans for him. I even told him sweet things like thanks for being a blessing etc. but he has yet to respond.      I have a rough idea that he is going through something but I thought my message will cheer him up. I swear my message I anticipate would touch him and make him cry but I guess not?      He is an emotional person and very caring towards me so this is odd that he is not responding even to say thanks.

I feel so lucky sometimes to be in love again and this time, it is really amazing. My first ever relationship/love I dated a guy from 17 to 27 and he was my soul mate at the time. I loved him and I know he loved me but we grew apart as we got older in our 20s. After that I thought that I had my one great love in my life. I went back to school and didn't date so I wasn't distracted. At 32 I graduated and promised myself I'd start dating because lonleyness was starting to bring me real down. I went on a dating app and met this guy. He was the first one I went on a date with and now 8 months later we still text everyday about he asked me to move in in 2 months.      I'm so in love and I just want to talk and write about to somewhere. I love this man, I'm so in love with how he treats me and the things he does and says. He is just the best. The company is wonderful. The sex is the best its ever been. He treats me so amazingly and does such nice things for me.      I always told myself that I had my one great love in my life already and that I was lucky to have that and didn't think I'd have love again.  But wow. Its so much better. Its amazing. I wish there was bigger words then I love you that I could tell him. I'm so happy in life right now that while I'm traveling for a bridesmaids party and my heart feel sick trying to fall asleep so far away from him. I hate it. I wish there was some way to turn off the love sickness. I can't wait to see him again.</Content></post><post><Title>Still very happy to not only have made a best friend, but also learned she is one of my platonic soulmates (my first at least)</Title><Author>u/Bandock666</Author><Content>I (36M) am very glad I was able to preserve this special bond with my best friend (45F).  She even decided to name me her best man (or man of honor) whenever she gets married.  That's honestly one of the greatest honors to be given and I appreciate it a great deal.  I still love her to this day, at least as a person (not romantically, but platonically).  I learned she was my platonic soulmate since December 2023, though did take me time to confirm it and share with her.      I have made many friends online, but this one in particular is unlike any other I have made.  The fact I learned she is my platonic soulmate makes it more special.  Even though I know how to find my own happiness; it's great to have someone be a special addition like her.  It's incredible to know someone who thinks on a very similar wavelength, able to connect very quickly, very similar values, etc.  Again, I appreciate her a great deal. ü•∞      If you have one or more platonic soulmates you truly appreciate, feel free to share. üòâ</Content></post><post><Title>What does my gf mean when she says she likes my hands and legs?</Title><Author>u/DystopicLasagna</Author><Content>Exactly what it sounds like. Sometimes she'll just tell me out of the blue that she really likes my hands, and sometimes the same about my legs. I've asked her why, but she just says that she doesn't know why, and that she likes how they feel against her. I'm not athletic though (BMI 28 and the only exercise I do is 4-5 days of cardio a week,) so my limbs aren't even muscular or rugged for her to find conventionally attractive      Anyone else have their S/Os feel the same way, or know the reasoning behind it?</Content></post><post><Title>My first press Steve McQueen.

I don‚Äôt think i could live life without him anymore; if something were to happen i‚Äôd hope we could remain friends.:)ü´∂</Content></post><post><Title>Don‚Äôt believe the myth you‚Äôll only experience true love once</Title><Author>u/obviousthrowawyy</Author><Content>When I ended my engagement in my early 20s, my ex told me that‚Äôd one day I‚Äôd regret it. During the next two failed relationships, he was somewhat correct; I felt I had fumbled the one man I had an authentic, non-forced romantic relationship with to try and force relationships with men who weren‚Äôt truly in love with me or compatible. During the most recent failed relationship, I told myself that at 30, I had to settle for a less-than-ideal relationship, because I had already experienced one relationship with a man who was head over heels for me.      In my early 30s, I‚Äôm in a relationship where I feel secure and where my partner regularly approves he genuinely adores me. Nothing was forced, everything progressed naturally. I‚Äôm a more mature and emotionally independent person than I was when I was engaged; that relationship was doomed to fail because of my own immaturity, toxicity and codependence, but that doesn‚Äôt mean what I experienced then wasn‚Äôt true love, nor does it detract from the love I‚Äôm experiencing now.      I feel lucky to have experienced this sort of love at all, let alone twice.</Content></post><post><Title>What are some ways you make your partner feel validated and appreciated?</Title><Author>u/Financial-Special820</Author><Content>No content</Content></post><post><Title>A letter for you, to my love, my future husband</Title><Author>u/ellabanaana</Author><Content>My love,      I cannot wait meet you.

I love my girlfriend so much. She‚Äôs asleep right now because she has to get up for work way earlier than me but every day after she falls asleep I just reminisce on the day we had and it‚Äôs always so amazing. Sure we have days where we argue but we always resolve and speak fairly to one another. I‚Äôve never loved someone like I love her. Sometimes it‚Äôs like I‚Äôm looking into a mirror we are so alike but we are also so different I can‚Äôt explain it. Most days consist of me getting off work and going to either her place or mine where she will be waiting for me. Then we go to the gym and either cook or get food. After that it‚Äôs yk what time then we shower and watch tv together. It‚Äôs so simple and mundane but so meaningful. I can talk to her about anything and she just gets me and vice versa. She is the most beautiful amazing woman I‚Äôve ever met and I‚Äôm so excited for our future. We will be moving in together near the end of the summer and I haven‚Äôt been this excited for anything in so long. She‚Äôs already started picking out decorations and furniture; it‚Äôs so adorable. She tells me she loves me at least 50 times a day. We‚Äôre both young and started supporting ourselves younger than most so it‚Äôs so nice to be with someone who understands the challenges that comes with. I would do anything for this girl. The only gripe I have is that she won‚Äôt play against me in chess because she just started and I‚Äôve been playing for years. Anyways, I‚Äôm not that great at writing these kind of things but I hope you enjoyed.</Content></post><post><Title>A written love letter, to you, my beloved future wife.</Title><Author>u/Myamoxomis</Author><Content>To my future wife,      I‚Äôm looking forward to meeting you. They say that I shouldn‚Äôt need a woman to be happy. Are they right? Well, yeah. Of course they‚Äôre right, but a woman makes life better. You would make my life better, and I would do everything in my power to add to your life.      All this time I‚Äôve spent alone is going to be worth it, because someday, you, the woman who will love me through my flaws, my depression, my past, my mistakes, my failures, my insecurities, my fears, and my emotions‚Ä¶ will walk into my life and love me.      You‚Äôll see me, the real me. You‚Äôll see the purity in my heart. You‚Äôll hear the wisdom I share and feel empowered with me by your side. You‚Äôll know that no matter what, I will still hold you, kiss you on the forehead, and tell you that I‚Äôve got you. My dear, I make this vow to you.      I vow to sacrifice for you. I vow to lift you up and permanently spin you around in a dance of love. I vow to stay by your side until your very last breath. I vow to stay loyal, to communicate with you, and to do anything and everything to protect you and our unborn children from whatever challenges or obstacles that may come our way, even death, whom I no longer fear. I will stare him in eyes for your sake, my love.      When you feel weak, I will be your strength. When you feel afraid, I will lend you my hand. When you feel angry, I will soothe your pain.

Your grief will be my grief. Your anger will be my anger. Your triumphs will be my triumphs. Your sadness will be my sadness. Your enemies will be my enemies. Your friends will be my friends. Your family will be my family.      I will worship your mind, your heart, your soul, and every inch of your body.      And I will serve you second to only the almighty God.      And on I read, Until the day was gone, And I sat in regret, Of all the things I've done, For all that I've blessed, And all that I've wronged, In dreams until my death, I will wander on, In your house, I long to be, Room by room, patiently, I'll wait for you there, Like a stone, I'll wait for you there, Alone, Alone.</Content></post><post><Title>I care so much about her. I want her to feel as happy as she makes me</Title><Author>u/Mreow277</Author><Content>I've never felt like this for anyone, except for my younger brother, whom I care about deeply. She makes me feel so great. All the stress of my life went away for days the last time we met. I've never felt so much love to the point I lierally can't imagine loving someone like this again. She brings out the best things about me. I feel so much love and emapthy thanks to her. So much happiness. I'm almost scared of how blinded I'm by love. It's like I'm a different, better person. I've realised so much about where my anxieties and paranoias comes from, because they dissappeared thanks to her.      I want to know more about her. I want her to be happy. I want to cuddle with her and see her smile. She's got a heart of gold. I want her to know how much I love her. I feel extremly anxious about dissapointing her in any way.      I couldn't attend the party we were both supposed to be on and now I feel so much shame. I strongly feel like I might have dissapointed her.

Sometimes, when he's states away from our house, when he's working and studying. Sometimes, I realize that my brother could be an angel; he's so overwhelmingly kind, his voice tone and even his typing style is unusually relaxing and comforting.      He's also cared for my emotions and well-being, I know he won't be revengeful and vindictive with my things, our parents would've preferred to speak out anything agaisnt me. He doesn't take his stress and his bad feelings out of me, and if he will, I know he's a human being with slip-ups but it will never be intentional, a routine or a second nature.      He's going to accept me, he's already suspected but accepted me anyway even if nothing is confirmed. He encourages this life style, he's so cute complementing and flattering my new hairstyle changes when I'd received threats and backlash.      He's defended me when I thought he would've never dared to protest agaisnt his first most beloved person who was the one mistreating me the most.      Guys, this person is made of flesh and bones, to me, he's an angel and I haven't been Christian for a long time.</Content></post><post><Title>Let me get this out , so I can feel better. Monday spiraling .</Title><Author>u/Icy_Teaching_7092</Author><Content>I went to a beautiful wedding with love , joy, exciment, family, dancing, food, drinks , music and laughter.  My brother got married this past weekend,  and I'm so happy for him . Little did I know a wedding would break me down , and it did Monday night. Sunday I was exhausted after getting home after it , swollen feet , and sleep deprived . Monday became a Monday for no reason, and it hit like a tidal wave .  I cleaned my car out and vacuumed it out . My dad was being annoying bc he just had to see how good of a job I did on my own car . He wanted to " Inspect " it . I said no your not seeing the inside of my car , I bought it and pay for it . He returned with being petty and on my case about stuff . I asked him where I could get my state inspection done , he wasn't a help . Every Monday is trash day .... he is an odd ball about it . I did the dishes after dinner and I apparently had to take the trash out asap .  I was over his attitude mostly. It hit me the wrong way , and then my bf ... I wanted to see him . I offered to get dinner and drinks and I didn't get a response till later on . It was too late to go out with him bc my dad was also making dinner at the time . I was just over the whole day , and I was still exhausted.  I got to see my bf today for lunch on his break , and it was nice . Last night I just bawled.  I bawled like a baby , bc I was over the wedding stuff , my ex husband didn't want to do a huge thing for us getting married, and I guess again grieving in a way . Grieving bc I didn't have a big wedding, grieving bc of a lot back then.  I'm not sure if it was any sort of a trigger , but damn it.  My bf called me tonight like usual , and he is making me dinner , washed the bed sheets and wants to go to the beach for sunset tomorrow . I mentioned that I see him once a week , and it kills me . He offered to spend time with me this weekend as well,  and tomorrow night.  Sometimes , I forget that I have someone who actually cares and loves me . I felt a disconnect from him, but I over think . My gut feelings weren't screaming,  just my heart was aching . I really was sad and mad at the world . I tried to call my bestie , bc she usually helps me figure shit out . I think I understand why I was upset and what I needed.  Long story short , I feel better and get to be spoiled tomorrow night . Oh and the hot water heater blew... so a cold shower is a must tomorrow yay .</Content></post><post><Title>People who are very happily married, when did you start to imagine a future with that person?</Title><Author>u/WeeklyDamage8006</Author><Content>I‚Äôve heard the phrase ‚Äúif they don‚Äôt imagine a future with you from day one, they never will‚Äù. How true is that really? In my case, if I really like someone I will start to fantasize about a life together but it‚Äôs more in the fun of getting to know each other. It isn‚Äôt like I‚Äôd actually marry them after a month but the idea is there. It‚Äôs like excitement, not love bombing or anything drastic.      Are there people who didn‚Äôt have those thoughts until months or years later and everything is okay?      Additional question: for those of you that were nervous about rushing into things, like the people who get nervous thinking of marriage or buying a ring, what made you change your mind?      Asking this as someone who has never had a guy love bomb or vocalize thoughts like this and it‚Äôs making me a little nervous about that phrase.      EDIT: thanks everyone for the replies!

We only dated a few weeks and I thought I'd be over you by now, but I'm not. It's about to be two months soon. I know you most likely still don't feel the same way. I know you are just trying to figure out what you want. That is not something I want to rush, although a part of me is still holding on to the hope that you'll decide you want to be with me. Things happen for a reason and maybe us breaking up and deciding to be friends was a way of God saying not now or he's not the right person at the moment. I'm trying my best to stop thinking about you although we text often and send reels a lot. I try not to be as excited to see your name pop up on my screen. You did make me happy, but it's all you. I'm just a hopeless romantic with my heart slowly repairing itself. Thanks for letting me talk to you about what has gone on in my life that made me who you see today. I know it's pointless to hold on to these feelings and I'm trying to let go of them, but that is difficult. I hope whoever you decide to be with one day knows how lucky they are to have you.

I'm just trying to get close to you.</Title><Author>u/BrookieD820</Author><Content>You and I have been friends for a while. Then we started fooling around.  It was all so new to me even at my age.  I know you've had limited relationship experience too and that your last one ended tragically. We'd been getting really close, really fast and the intensity of our physical relationship has been a whirlwind.      Three weeks ago, that changed when we spent the night together for the first time.  You were super sweet for the next two days and then you became cold and shut me out.  You told mutual friends of ours that you needed time.  This was obviously becoming more than a FWB thing and you freaked. You promised me you wouldn't run for the hills. Since then, you keep reaching out to me but not making plans with me to talk about any of this, or called me. I keep trying to be patient. We have such amazing chemistry, it's easy being with you.  I have given more of myself to you than I have to anybody else in my entire life. You could have just told me you needed a breather, I would have been fine.      I just want you. I want to get close to you. You said I was beautiful, that you wanted me, that you loved being with me.  You call me sweetie and hold my hand, you took a day off work to spend time with me. And now we're nowhere. Do you even miss me?      What are you so scared of? Somebody loving you? I am trying, but I can't put myself through this for much longer. All I've been asking for is for us to sit down and talk about this to see if we can move forward and I can't even get that.

I remember everything about us so clearly, yet it already feels like it was years and years ago. Time slowed down and I spend it either thinking of you or distracting myself.      Either way I can't catch my breath.      And I feel so stupid because you probably forgot what day is today. You probably already forgot what we were.      To you, mine was just a role, right? No matter who takes it.      I finally had a stable and well paid job. I was gonna get us a new home. Everything seemed perfect at first.      But I guess the taller, toxic guy with a random job who lived close to you was even better.      How can I start loving somebody else as easily as you did? You have fun with him while I keep dreaming of you at night.      In my dreams I can see you, talk with you, hug you, lay on a bed with you. Everything feels better. Then I wake up, and everything feels worse than before. I begin asking myself, why should I even get up from bed and work?      Yeah, for myself. To keep my life going. But who's giving me back the one half you took away from me?      It's as if I never existed in the first place, and I hate you for what you've done to me.      Still.      You will always be family to me.      If you ever come back, I'll surely fall for it.

It showed me the importance of waiting for someone who would love me fully and unconditionally.      When I think about what I hoped for in a partner, she surpasses every expectation. Her love has shown me a happiness that feels almost otherworldly, an emotional connection that I didn‚Äôt know was possible. Every moment with her feels like a gift, a constant reminder of how wonderful life can be when shared with someone as special as her.      She‚Äôs given me more than just love; she‚Äôs given me a reason to wake up with a smile, to look forward to each new day, and to feel truly alive. The way she cares for me, understands me, and brings light into my life is something I never imagined I could have, something I never imagined I deserved.      She is my dream come true, my best friend, and I am endlessly thankful for the love we share. The depth of our connection leaves me in awe, and I am so grateful for the beautiful journey we are on together.      I simply wanted to share the joy of what true love is, what I think true love should always feel like.      I pray you all find the kind of love I have found in this lifetime and in the next.

We started talking in November, I told him I love him once a couple of months ago and I was happy with his response that he wasn‚Äôt ready to say it yet but he has really strong feelings for me.      He travels for work, usually a week or so at a time but this trip is only a day or two and I‚Äôm at his house. He woke me this morning and as he was leaving he said ‚ÄúI love you‚Äù my half asleep brain didn‚Äôt process it immediately so I said ‚Äúbe safe‚Äù      Now I‚Äôm questioning if it was a slip or if he meant it. I won‚Äôt have this conversation through the phone so I‚Äôm waiting till probably tomorrow night for him to get home.      I feel like a teenager lol I do love him but I never said it regularly after the first time because I don‚Äôt want to put pressure on him.      For a little context we both had really damaging long relationships before meeting. My husband was abusive and passed away and his ex seems to have been verbally and mentally abusive toward him. (I only know his side of the story but he included his wrongs when telling me about their past).

Two of the least toxic relationships I had still weren‚Äôt healthy, one because he sold drugs and I was a 17 year old with a drug problem due to being homeless and the second was addicted to ketamine so it came with problems, but they were both nice to me.      Every other relationship I have been in as been abusive. I‚Äôve been with narcissists, people who‚Äôve emotionally, physically and sexually abusive to me.      For the last few months I‚Äôve been dating a lovely man. Not a drug addict, looks like a model, he‚Äôs sooo kind and respectful of women, owns his own business, never shouts or takes his anger out on me. Shows me love and affection. I met him through one of my friends of 16 years who has vetted him and told him he‚Äôs good for me and tried to set us up.      He accepts me whole heartedly and is supportive. My mum passed away and he supported me all the way through it and came to the funeral, he‚Äôs generous with me and showers me with adoration and wants to spend as much time with me as possible.      One of my close friends told my other friend, I‚Äôm looking forward to meeting him because he seems good for her. This other friend also knew of him, he said ‚Äúhe had a healthy relationship with with his ex, but (my name) has only been in toxic relationships‚Äù it made me feel that most people think I‚Äôm at fault for being abused in relationships. I feel relieved that I‚Äôll be in a healthy relationship and won‚Äôt be victim blamed or villainised for the abuse I‚Äôve endured, this will be the relationship that maybe will wake people up that I‚Äôm not the problem other than condoning it for too long.      I feel so lucky to have found such a loving kind person after living a lifetime with the opposite.      üôè</Content></post><post><Title>Waiting for Superman.

To make you feel and see my love. To be your your safe space, your love and best friend.      But you‚Äôre not my Superman. Or my Romeo. I‚Äôve been a fool in love, purposely blinding myself to the truth.      God keeps slapping me in the face, time and time again, shouting that you‚Äôre not for me. I‚Äôve tried to change his mind. Because somehow, you were home.      Your mental health. Your finances. I never ran away. I fought for our love. So I can stay in your arms, where I always want to be.      But it hurts. To know my support is never good enough. Your career will always come first. And our relationship ‚Äî and any future family we could have had ‚Äî will always be the sacrificial lamb.      It‚Äôs breaking my heart. To know I will never be No. 1. I know what I must do, yet it‚Äôs killing me.      I‚Äôll have to keep waiting for my Superman.

They'd understand it and take it in subconsciously. I used to sneak into my dads room and whisper to him that he should buy me new toys. Fun times.      Nowadays I don't know if I believe it. But when my boyfriend is asleep I like to whisper things to him.      I tell him how amazing he is, how beautiful he is. Sometimes I just tell him he should be proud of himself, or he is really good at his hobbies or job. The other day he got his 8th platinum achievement on PlayStation and when he was asleep I kept going on about how cool he was, that he is awesome at video games and he can definitely make it to 10 (his goal)      He wakes up sometimes, laughs a bit and gives me a cuddle. Never remembers it in the morning.      I don't know if it works. But I hope it does. Because he deserves to know how amazing he is.      EDIT : I am a man. We are gay.

I got so lucky to meet someone as amazing as my partner ü•∞</Title><Author>u/Traditional_Set_858</Author><Content>So l was definitely a late bloomer as I only had one very short term boyfriend at 22 and I wouldn't even consider that relationship experience because it really wasn't like a relationship at all. It wasn't until I was 25 when I finally decided to put myself out there as I really wanted to experience being in love as I had never experienced it.      I eventually caved and downloaded Tinder and literally within 2 weeks I had met my amazing partner and went on our first date and a week later we were officially a couple. It was completely out of character for me to go so quickly into a relationship but it just felt natural and it was one of those things where it just felt right to take the chance.      We've now been together for a year and a half and I definitely can say I found my person. We not only have similar interests but we get along so well and really understand each other. He does everything he can to make sure I'm happy in the relationship and occasionally asks if there's any issues or concerns I have. He does little things for me like take out the trash, surprise me with little things like Starbucks, or offers to get me food delivered if I'm not feeling well. He also took me to his home country and I got to meet his family and I just felt so welcomed and it was so nice to see where he grew up.      I never thought l'd love someone so much that I'm willing to spend a little time everyday learning a new language. It literally feels like I won the lottery with this man as I can't believe that not only was he single when I met him but that he chose me out everyone else. Even though I definitely wish we would have met sooner in life he was definitely worth the wait.</Content></post><post><Title>I love my girlfriend.

Gosh I just want to keep kissing her, holding her and telling her she's perfect. We're in a long distance but we've met a lot of times but never enough. I'm just glad she stuck with me so far and even more, I'm just glad she chose the dorkiest idiot and said "yep. That's mine" I love, appreciate, and look up to her.

He came for my prom and when I say I‚Äôve never felt so in love I mean it.      The whole time I felt like we were the only people there and I couldn‚Äôt stop looking at him. He was so affectionate and calling me perfect and ‚Äúmore beautiful in person‚Äù and be was so patient about everything including our first kiss, which made me like him 1000x more. I think we touched foreheads about 5 times trying to go for the first kiss but I kept backing out LOL. After the first one, the rest were so easy. He was complimenting me all night and hugging me every second and kissing all over my forehead and cheek and neck but I loved that I could tell it was endearing and not sexual. Like I literally FELT the affection radiating off of him. On the dance floor we were hugging and I was leaning back on him and he just stayed there for me even tho he HATES dancing and swore off of it. He spent 60% of the night there for me, which I‚Äôm very grateful for.      His smile was so genuine and he would look at me and ask for a kiss over and over it was so cute dude. Everything physical he took his time w, which btw didnt go far but like what we did do he was so gentle with and asked ‚Äúcan I‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..‚Äù ‚Äúyes or no?‚Äù I found it so adorable in the moment. ik it‚Äôs bare minimum but it‚Äôs just a relief and honestly blessing knowing he cares how I feel in the moment and thinks about me when he‚Äôs horny ig? üò≠      Like seriously, even our tongue kiss was so gentle. I was so nervous and he was like ‚Äúfor one second, I‚Äôll teach you,‚Äù and not in a demanding way but more question and care. I did it and then did it 1-2 more times for a couple seconds and got embarrassed and dug my head into his chest bc I thought I was doing really bad, and then I just like mumbled ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know what to do or how to do it..‚Äù and he reassured me the second after and was saying ‚Äúnooooo it was good‚Ä¶.baby it was perfect, I swear.‚Äù and I was blushing the WHOLE TIME.      Anyways, after the bus ride back and cute I just kinda laid on his shoulder and almost passed out on his lap bc I was so exhausted and we took a drive to Dave and busters but he had to leave early, sadly. I think one of the cutest things was him saying ‚Äúthe pictures please, the PhotoBooth and card‚Äù bc I had taken a picture for us and made us save each others table cards and him remembering and saying it in the actual most adorable voice, not like a baby but like imagine a grown man or deep voiced guy just saying it so softly. Then he said I love you and I‚Äôll miss you and we kissed goodbye üôÅ.      Now, I‚Äôm going to his house in a week or two for his pool and we‚Äôre gonna have fun in there there watch a movie together and cuddle in our matching pjs and build a lego set I bought us.      I‚Äôm so happy so have stuck through the long year of petty fights and lack of touch bc it was all worth it. Our 15 months is in 6 days, it feels surreal.

This happened early on in our relationship, a little under four years ago.      When we met my guy was starting his recovery from a serious meth addiction and as you can imagine I didn‚Äôt want to be involved with that, at all. So even though we had a serious connection I kept turning him down because I didn‚Äôt want to take any chances there, but after about six months of getting to know him I finally broke down and kissed him.      We got together, and things were great. Then about six more months into our relationship there was one bad day where he wasn‚Äôt acting like himself and he was out hanging out with some guys I didn‚Äôt know, and I ended up finding $40 missing from my bank account.      When I confronted him about it he admitted what he‚Äôd done. And I took my time to think about what that meant to me, because obviously I couldn‚Äôt just ignore what had happened. I definitely wasn‚Äôt going to just sit there and let him do things like that, to me or to himself. I wasn‚Äôt going to be an enabler and I wasn‚Äôt going to tie myself to that.      So I took him and sat him down. And I explained that I knew he was recovering from a serious addiction and because of that I was going to forgive him for what had happened.      And I also explained that I would give him two years. I wouldn‚Äôt commit to anything serious in that time, but if he could stay completely clean and sober it would show me that he was serious about our relationship. And to show him I was just as serious, I said that if he could do that, I would marry him.      Now, four years later, he‚Äôs still completely sober and we‚Äôre engaged and I can say without a doubt that giving him a second chance that night was absolutely the best decision I have ever made. He is the love of my life. He never hesitates to tell me how beautiful I am or how much he loves me, and when I‚Äôm feeling bad he always does everything he possibly can to make me feel better. He is my world.</Content></post><post><Title>My loving partner knows exactly when I need him the most!</Title><Author>u/Yorkie_Mom_2</Author><Content>My son passed away suddenly eight months ago (I promise this is relevant to this story). I met my partner two months later. My partner is the love of my life -- the best man I've ever met. We fell in love within two or three weeks of meeting, and our love continues to grow. He is an amazing partner! He shows his love in ways I never dreamed possible (including bringing me breakfast in bed a couple of times a week).      Tonight we were working here in the study. We each have a computer in here, and there is also a bed for napping. Just before I moved here two months ago, he set up Apple Home using Siri. One of Siri's skills is to play music all over the house when we ask her to. As we are both working at our computers, listening to music, the song "In the Arms of the Angels" starts to play. My wonderful, loving partner knew that song would trigger intense grief in me and make me cry. As soon as it started playing, he stood up, came to my computer, put his arms around me and said, "Come on, let's go snuggle." I was already crying. My partner led me to the bed, pulled me into his arms, told Siri to stop the music, held me, and talked to me about my son until I stopped crying.      I have never felt so loved. I love this man more than he can imagine. I know without a doubt that he feels the same.</Content></post><post><Title>I find emotional intimacy difficult in many ways. Many people seem to want to hide who they are.</Title><Author>u/Objective-Candle3478</Author><Content>I do get the feeling that nowadays what leads to a big issue with relationships is, on one hand so many people just want to be loved for who they truly are. But then on the other those very same individuals get too scared/timid to actually let others in on real emotionally intimate level.      How can someone be loved unconditionally if they don't show who they truly are to others? When I say this I mean, their fears, insecurities, and doubts in the moment as well as the positives. So many go out their way to protect their own ego that they hurt those willing to want to love them for who they are. I do think a lot is because of issues with perfectionism and what it means to be attractive.      It's scary to actually put yourself truly on the line like that. But by doing so makes you a fantasticaslly strong individual. To accept and understand that you are a perfectly imperfect individual takes a lot of strength, and through that strength is being vulnerable you can have a chance at unconditional love.

We don‚Äôt talk on the phone as much as we use to. We sometimes go on friendly outings. I still do my best in showing my appreciating for her in anyway I could think of.      I just really want to say how proud I am of her. I‚Äôm proud everything she‚Äôs been able to achieve; before we met and after we met.      I look at the casual photos I love taking of her and I think she‚Äôs so sexy, so inspiring, so beautiful, and so intelligent. She‚Äôs off the radar bro. She‚Äôs crazy to think she‚Äôs ugly if she really believes that. I seriously love this women. I love to see her laugh. I love when it‚Äôs me making her laugh. I love the way she walks. I even love when she‚Äôs nagging, I don‚Äôt mean it in any disrespectful way. For example, when she tries to convince me to take cab home instead of walking home at night and she‚Äôs super serious but I still decide to walk home, because overall I live like 15 blocks away lol.      I love her nose. I love her big eyes. I love her hair. I love her forehead. I love the smudged oval  birthmark on the right side of her face. I love when shes eating. I love her fingernails. I love her toes. I love her belly. I love her family to because they are good people. I love when the hairs on her legs are growing. I love her kisses when she use to give me some. I super love her hugs and when it lasts for more than 10 seconds. I love her style. I love her charisma. I love how funny she is. I love her principles. I love her dog. I literally can go on and on. I love how she just a boss. I love her being anal about having matching sheets. I love how she‚Äôs always trying to evolve. From upgrading her standard toothbrush to an electric one üò≠ or just taking care of herself and her needs.      Shit I love she broke up with me because I totally respect that and respect her. At this point, i think I can care less if she gets back with me. It would hurt, yes, if she decided to move on entirely and we don‚Äôt talk anymore but part of me is just so grateful to be in her presence still and show her, even though we are friends, how much I still appreciate her. I can never convince myself things I hate about her. I‚Äôm here for her until whenever. I won‚Äôt let her go. I wish I was Superman and I could sweep her off her feet and fly her out of earth and show her the stars and planets. I will try my best to show it every chance I get to show and prove to her. I Need to use my brain and show her it‚Äôs more than the dates, the past sex, etc. I really can‚Äôt explain it but I just love the time she gives me, the care she had for me, everything yo. That‚Äôs my women still until she leaves me for good. I ain‚Äôt going no where g. I stand firm in that.</Content></post><post><Title>For 30 Years, I loved with contempt. My ex wife despised me.</Title><Author>u/saffermaster</Author><Content>After a few years licking my wounds, I put myself out there at age 55, trying to find love. I spent 4 years enjoying kinky sex with women of every age. From 18 to 60. Nothing I did could fill the emptiness I felt in my broken heart. One woman I dated shared with me that in spite of my sense of failure, that she found me imminently lovable. Another lover told me that I am too distant and "You need to let me in,"      I went out and got a tattoo on my chest that took 7 months to complete. It captured my sense that attraction was possible, that there was a certain randomity to the world, that we lived in an endless universe and that I am lovable. Its a cool trash punk tattoo.      I looked hard at what was missing from my marriage. It occurred to me that intimacy was missing.      One day I got a message from a woman on a kink site who saw my "seeking post". She was as kinky as me and also looking for intimacy and we started a dialogue. We courted for 6 months before we began our dynamic formally. That was 6 years ago.      in 6 days I am going to marry her. I could not be happier. We not only found love, we fell in love and have had a steamy love affair that goes on and on. I am so here for it.      Its possible to find love. I can guarantee that there is love after divorce. My life is poetry.      Update:      Kink is interesting. People of all ages participate. There are kids who learn about kink at a very young age, and are perhaps more ready to explore kink when they get to age 18 than others are till much later in life. One thing about being Dom in a kink setting like a club or munch is that submissives of all ages and genders approach you and negotiate a scene with you. Remember, all kink is based on consent, not persuasion, informed enthusiastic consent. I should have noted that I practice RACK which is Risk-Aware Consensual Kink, and SSC, Safe, Sane Consensual Kink. I get the idea that morality has it that young adults should not play with old adults, but that is simply your own ick, nobody else's.

We made our relationship official in April, so I like to think we took it pretty slow. In every other relationship I have ever had, I felt the need to be so careful about my body, my choices, and never felt at home with my partners. I always was waiting for the next step of where I was going to go to next. I made sure that we used multiple forms of protection when we were intimate. I never felt like I could be my sensitive, extroverted self fully. Before we became romantic, he helped me pass the final course I needed for my first degree. I had been calling my "Rave Husband", because we were always attached at the hip at the many raves we stuffed into a year. He spent the day with me after I had emergency surgery, just so I wouldn't be alone. He is one of the only people that has ever made an effort to celebrate my birthday. He got out of his car when I did, because he thought he was going to have to pull me off of some guy in front of a bar, and still decided to want me. He watched me projectile vomit outside of a show in 100 degree weather, and left early with me, and cuddled me while I looked like a drowned sewer rat months long before he declared his feelings. With this man??? I told this man today that I trust him enough to decide when and if he ever wants to put a baby in me. I told this man that I would provide for him whatever he desires in this world and then more. I made this man know I intend on marrying him and making sure that he smiles every day for the rest of his life. I let this man do things to me today that I would have never allowed anyone else do. Suddenly, just like magic, I would give him everything I am and still be searching for more to give him. Every day, I find out more about him that makes my love grow even bigger. I sat in my bedroom for hours today waiting for him to call on his work break, in shock with myself at the words that had come out of my mouth to him before he had left. Never in my life have I been down this bad for someone. Every day it gets worse. I grieve for the time in this life that I won't get to spend with him. I have never wanted to just spend a day laying around with someone. It's like I have been possessed. Somehow, I have known my best friend for over a year now and the love I have for him only continues to grow exponentially with time that I fear I may one day explode.

It kills me every eye waking moment. I can‚Äôt stop thinking about how you may be slowly falling out of love for me and how our connection is less than what we had before. It makes me second guess everything and our relationship. Questions like Did you ever love me? Ofc you did. You stood by me when things were stressful. Your actions are louder than words, yet I think maybe you did not love me much as you thought. It‚Äôs fine, I just hate to think I‚Äôm not your person and you aren‚Äôt mine.  Why aren‚Äôt we trying to reconcile this? I mean we‚Äôre friends still so is that what that is? You said you were firm in your decision in not getting back with me. I try not to let it bother me; not cling to our little memories we had and not push away the fact you may over and done with me. I‚Äôm trying to experience the gift of life without fighting it. Yet my will is strong in not letting you go. New beginnings?      Why do I feel that you‚Äôre going to eventually leave me once you find discover a new connection? It‚Äôs ideal. Is our friendship ideal?. Wishes of my life in order so that we can shine in gold and sparkle in the night time. We take it all off and we still shine.      I‚Äôm sorry I ever pursued you and I wasn‚Äôt ready yet I don‚Äôt feel bad, how could I be? You allowed me to feel a feeling I never felt before. I  wish you can run to me when your heart feels heavy and lean your head on my shoulder. We had sex once after the break up and I wish you wanted my love more than you lust for sex at the moment? Is that a valid statement to say? Maybe you do want my love but baby I want all of you not just part of you. Please come home and sit still inside me because I would hate to see you come and go. Until you find someone new‚Ä¶ I‚Äôll be here‚Ä¶ until you find someone new Ill be here.      I just wanted to make you know how I feel although it may bug you I‚Äôm overthinking. I just wish things were different. I know you may feel different. I love you for it regardless. I love to see you prosper with or without me. It hurts but baby I‚Äôm here in the back of the ceremony rooting for you, so happy for you, I know your eyes are fixed on someone new and other things so you don‚Äôt notice me and that‚Äôs fine, here I am, happy for your accomplishments. I will forever love you as long as I know who I am and the love I have experienced. I will always pray for you and your family as I have been doing. Thank you for reading this. You don‚Äôt have to talk about anything I said.      Sincerely,      the boy who dreams countless lucid dreams and with you by my side, for infinity. Give me your hand and let me put a ring on it, forever kiss it. I can never break this bond even when you come crashing like thunderstorms from the southern states to the Great Plains.</Content></post><post><Title>My partner came to find me at 5am when I couldn't sleep and gave me his favourite stuffed toy</Title><Author>u/Apprehensive_Low6883</Author><Content>I struggle to sleep a lot and if I can't go back to sleep after a while, I just suck it up and start looking at my phone. If my partner is in bed with me asleep I'll leave the bed to sleep on the sofa because I don't want my movement and lights to keep him up.      He doesn't really like waking up without me so I try to sneak into bed before he gets up, but I can't always do it.      Anyway last night I fell asleep on the sofa and I was scrolling from about 2-5 AM. He came in about 5 with his favourite stuffed toy, he was in a daze a bit but said "aww are you up? I thought I'd give you (toys name) for company."      Then he asked me to come back to bed and we cuddled for a bit. It's just really nice. I never ever thought I'd find someone like this.</Content></post><post><Title>A Visual Representation Depicting the Impact of True Love on Our Very Beings</Title><Author>u/TestingTheWatersKY</Author><Content>No content</Content></post><post><Title>A little story of how I met the girl I‚Äôve been talking to.</Title><Author>u/Zealousideal_Ad321</Author><Content>Sorry, this will be long, but very worth the read. The feeling of new love is so euphoric, I just have to share. We have decided not to put a label on what we have going on, so I don‚Äôt consider her my girlfriend by any means. I broke up with an ex of 1 year about a month and a half ago, and since about 4 weeks ago, me and this girl have been talking more than before, and hanging out. I never even thought about flirting or making a move, because I was in the process of getting out of a relationship I felt stuck in. More than anyone else, she helped me understand what was wrong with my relationship and would always give pointers on how to make relationships more successful. I had given up on love. For months before I broke up with my ex, me and this girl talked all the time about love. I explained to her many many times that I‚Äôve lost faith in relationships. My ex of 5 years cheated on me along with physical abuse. My ex after that started acting like my other ex(very violent) and I decided that no one should ever feel threatened by their partner, even if they haven‚Äôt taken a swing yet. This girl explained to me that life is about taking chances and dating shouldn‚Äôt be ruled out just yet. Always kind of hinting at the thought of us being together. I work as a CNA in a long term care facility and she does the same PRN. We don‚Äôt work together much, but everytime we have, it seems like every one of our coworkers seem to think we were together. It‚Äôs not just our coworkers, the residents we take care of hint at it and tease us both about dating each other. A week or so after I broke up with my ex, I was on the phone with her. We talked about what went wrong and why I had bad luck with dating before. She kept expressing to not lose hope. The next day we worked together and while we were changing residents/doing vitals etc, she kept sort of bumping into me. She would stand really close when we talked and never took her eye off me. I knew what was happening and I wasn‚Äôt about to let my insecurities pass this off. We started talking about taking it super slow in a relationship being the best choice. She mentions she wouldn‚Äôt mind doing something like that and I say the same. To hang out, talk all the time, whatever couples do, just not labeling it. We figure that‚Äôs the best way to do things, except that we‚Äôve already knew each other for 11 months that I‚Äôve been working with her and have became very good friends. When she brings this up I knew for a fact that she wanted to go out with me, so I asked her if she wanted to come have some drinks and watch some movies at my house. She very quickly agreed and we made a date to hang out. When the time comes, she shows up at my house, like an hour late(she had a good excuse) and we start talking. We put on a movie but not a second of it was watched. We just talked and talked. I knew I couldn‚Äôt chicken out and not make a move, and I also knew that with her being very shy, there was no way she was going to make a move. Everytime I got up from the couch to grab another beer or make her a drink, I would sit closer and closer when I got back to the couch. At this point I‚Äôve had 2 or 3 beers and I was starting to feel my intuition slip away. Even if she tells me she doesn‚Äôt like me like that, I‚Äôll be able to defend my actions and apologize, so what‚Äôs to lose? I had this overwhelming feeling that I misunderstood all of our talks and all the hints, all the things residents and coworkers have said. I felt like she wasn‚Äôt comfortable and that I was going to make a big mistake if I were to make a move.  After making her a drink and sitting down right next to her, were our arms are touching, I throw my arm around her and she sinks into me, holding me, like she‚Äôs been waiting 11 months for this. I‚Äôve never felt so exhilarated in my life. I figured I‚Äôve got it in the bag, so I lean in to kiss her and she grabs my face and pulls it closer. We ended up making out for quite some time before she had to leave for work in the morning. I felt very very happy about this and high on life. Within a couple days we had already set up another time for us to hang out. I decided we should go on a hike, then back to my house. That was very successful as well and I felt like there was nothing stopping us from continuing this. She‚Äôs been on vacation for the last 2 weeks but we plan to go camping next Wednesday and Thursday on an island. We have so much in common and she is absolutely stunning. I can‚Äôt mess this up, but I at least know for sure that even if it doesn‚Äôt work out, we will still be great friends. Thank you for all that came to listen , have a great day!</Content></post><post><Title>What are the activities that you do with your partner that is not part of your usual routine?</Title><Author>u/MarcelineVampQueen18</Author><Content>My boyfriend and I live like 5 hours away from each other because of my work.

It's been a while since we last spoke, and I've been doing some reflecting lately &amp;amp; really for a long while now. There are memories we shared together that I still hold dear.      I wanted to take a moment to reach out and check in on you. Life has its up and downs, but I often find myself thinking about the times we spent together and the joy it brought me.      I know we've both moved on with our lives, but that doesn't diminish the significance of the impact you had on me. I just wanted you to know that I'm grateful for the time we had together even though short lived and the person you helped me become. Not to toot my own horn but I am pretty proud of the person I am today &amp;amp; in one way or another you had part into shaping who I am today.      The last time I attempted to rekindle our relationship/friendship, I know it didn‚Äôt end well. There were some assumptions that were made and although rightfully so, I never had the chance to explain myself or explain the misunderstanding. It‚Äôs been such a long time since so it may be irrelevant today but I wanted to reach out nonetheless. If you ever feel like catching up or grabbing a coffee, I'd love to hear from you. But regardless, I wish you nothing but happiness and fulfillment in all that you do. I pray for you and will continue to pray for your wellbeing &amp;amp; happiness.

He makes me so happy.</Title><Author>u/sheerest_of_folly</Author><Content>I know not many people will likely care to read my rant, but I love this man so fucking much.      We‚Äôve been dating for almost 3 years (anniversary in July). For 2.5 of them, we were online. Online relationships are hard. He‚Äôs in South Carolina, I was in Maryland.      I decided to move to him. On the way down, on January 31st, literally 40 minutes away, my mom fell asleep at the wheel and we crashed into the moving van (she was going to drop me off, as she herself was moving to Florida with my youngest sibling. Other sibling stayed with Dad in Maryland for college.)      I was the only one moderately injured in the wreck (thank God) and was taken to the hospital in an ambulance. I told my boyfriend where. He met me there. I saw my boyfriend in person for the first time while on a hospital bed.      The first few months were rough for me to settle in. 21 years in Maryland in the same area my whole life was hard to transition from. My boyfriend was with me every step of the way.      March was the anniversary of the deaths of several people who were important to me in my youth. They died in a car crash when I was a young teen. In Maryland, every year I would go to the playground we all played at on their deathiversary, since none of them were buried (all cremated to my knowledge). My boyfriend drove me the 500 miles to go back to Maryland to be at that playground.      In April, I had a breast reduction surgery. The recovery for that was rough‚Äî for the first two weeks, I couldn‚Äôt reach my middle well enough to use the bathroom. This man wiped my pee for me, and once the anesthesia wore off, my poop too. I got my period in the second week. He learned how to put a tampon in me and take it out. He was by my side the whole time.      The breast reduction was done in Maryland and we stayed with my father for a week. I‚Äôve only seen my father cry three times: when our cat died, at the end of Star Wars (because ‚Äúit‚Äôs so happy, they got the medals they worked so hard for‚Äù üíÄ), and when my boyfriend and I left. My father said he‚Äôs a good man and he‚Äôs so happy for us. He also gave him $400 to ‚Äúpay him back‚Äù for medical expenses. My boyfriend ended up using the remainder on a date with me.      Speaking of dates. I love notebooks and pens; my boyfriend doesn‚Äôt really care about those. Yet he took me on a date to Staples and Michaels, I thought to window shop but he bought so much for me. He also gets me some model skulls that I collect when he sees a cool one. Shortly after I moved in, he came home with one meant for an aquarium: ‚ÄúI thought of you.‚Äù I cried.      We went to MomoCon this year, and he cosplayed with me. We went as Leon and Ada from the Resident Evil series (specifically the RE4 remake). He waited in line for Digimon and Pok√©mon voice actors with me and listened to me rant about the characters I like.      We‚Äôre getting married next year. We aren‚Äôt conventionally engaged yet‚Äî he has something planned but won‚Äôt tell me‚Äî but we know we‚Äôre getting married. We just haven‚Äôt told our families yet.      I‚Äôm so fucking excited and happy that this is the man I get to spend my life with.</Content></post><post><Title>This is why it‚Äôs important to have a baby with the right man.</Title><Author>u/Taurussszn</Author><Content>I always tell my friends when you look at a man he should give you that feeling of ‚Äúugh I‚Äôd ruin my body to have a baby by this man‚Äù      &amp;amp; my man gave me those exact vibes. I couldn‚Äôt be any more proud the partner &amp;amp; soulmate I have.      We had an unplanned &amp;amp; first pregnancy last year. I never wanted kids but I‚Äôve always said if we was to have a baby I never want to work during my pregnancy and at least the first year of motherhood. He did just that respected my wishes. He took me out of my job provided for me throughout our pregnancy, allowed me to enjoy every aspect of it, attended ALL appointments included the ones that weren‚Äôt about the baby but about me.      That was the moment for me I knew I was having a baby with the right person. After I gave birth the first 6 weeks he didn‚Äôt leave by my side supported my throughout my breastfeeding journey (still doing) he cooked for me making sure I ate, made sure I got enough sleep, would take most nights with our newborn and some days too, made sure I didn‚Äôt feel overwhelmed.

I‚Äôve finished chemo 2 1/2 months ago, and I‚Äôve just now started to look a bit more like a human being, lol.      Seeing how I looked over the past few months breaks my heart, honestly. I wasn‚Äôt doing too bad physically all things considered, but holy shit, I looked like I was from a different species at times. Deep bags under my eyes, blue lips, yellow skin, bald, eyebrows gone‚Ä¶ picture a naked mole rat on the brink of death and yeah, that‚Äôs exactly what I looked like at times.      And yet, my boyfriend constantly made me feel like the sun shined out of my bald ass. Frankly speaking, I have no idea how we have managed to have an active sex life while I was going through treatment, but he didn‚Äôt make it look difficult at all.      Mind you, this is not a long relationship: I am 23, he‚Äôs 25, and we‚Äôve been together for just a bit over 6 months now. We‚Äôve met while I was going through treatment: I never would‚Äôve started a relationship in those circumstances, but he made it seem like the easiest, most natural thing. He has known about my condition from the very start, and he has never been intimidated by it. If anything, I feel like it makes him love me even more.      My last boyfriend broke up with me due to cancer, so this is such a huge deal for me. He takes care of me with such kindness and patience, I don‚Äôt know how he does it. He has never made me feel like a burden in the slightest. Whenever I feel bad, either physically or mentally, he just showers me with a seemingly infinite supply of love and care.      I can‚Äôt believe I am lucky enough to have someone like him in my life. Staying alive is so hard at times, but it becomes easy when I think of those in my life who want me to stay alive. If my cancer ever recurs, I‚Äôll take any treatment with a smile on my face for more time with those I love, him especially. With how hard it‚Äôs been at times, I feel like staying alive and sane is the biggest act of love I have to give.      I didn‚Äôt think men like him existed, especially after my last boyfriend - but they do. If any of you reading this ever feel like you‚Äôre too much for anyone to love, take me as living (for now, LOL) proof that there‚Äôs someone out there for you. The right person will think that what was ‚Äútoo much‚Äù for someone else is just right for them.</Content></post><post><Title>I miss you all the time.

I think about you constantly - when a song comes on that we listened to, in doing the activities we enjoyed together, in the quiet moments before I go to sleep when my chest just aches. Not committing to you when we were together is the biggest mistake of my life.      From the moment we met and started our relationship, happiness just seeped out of me. You made me smile, laugh, cry, FEEL, for the first time in years. We had passion, chemistry, connection, intellectual conversation, fun, mind blowing sex. Our relationship was beautiful and has so much potential to be beautiful for a long time.      You are so smart, kind, fit, happy, self aware, full of self love and love for others. You set boundaries better than any person I have ever met. All of which are aspects of you that I truly admire. I had learned, and still have so much to learn, from you. In our time together, you made me a better man, a better human, a better partner. You challenged me in so many ways - I miss this. I miss you.      I‚Äôm in love with you. There is no other way to say it. I don‚Äôt see a scenario in which that changes anytime soon.      I left M for me. I‚Äôm not drinking nearly as much as I was. I have my support system in place. I‚Äôm exercising every day. I‚Äôm in therapy.      All of these improvements can be for me and I can also have you by my side. Let me love you. Let us be together. Don‚Äôt be the one that got away.</Content></post><post><Title>How a Serendipitous Encounter with a Beautiful Woman Left a Lasting Impression</Title><Author>u/SamFendernot</Author><Content>Hey Reddit,      Tonight, something really unexpected happened while I was wandering around downtown Naples at about 9:30 pm. I just moved here and was feeling a bit nostalgic, so I decided to check out a few local restaurants to ask about job openings. I figured finding something to do at night a party from my day job would help me settle in. After a few stops, I found this place called Le Colonial, which is a cool mix of Vietnamese and French cuisine. It really caught my eye.      Inside, I met someone who really stood out. The manager‚Äîa young blonde with the most striking blue eyes I‚Äôve ever seen‚Äîinitially threw me off because I thought she was the hostess! After a quick chat, I left, but I couldn't stop thinking about her. So, 15 to 20 minutes later, I walked back in, pretending I needed a business card, but honestly, I just wanted to see her again and ask her out.      When I asked her out, she seemed pleasantly surprised and genuinely happy, even though she mentioned she had a boyfriend. Her warm smile didn‚Äôt stop me. I took the business card, smiled back, and hinted that I‚Äôd be back. Boyfriend or not, I felt a connection I couldn't ignore. Hopefully, she‚Äôs not getting married anytime soon!      I forgot to ask her name and it wasn‚Äôt on the card since she wasn‚Äôt the general manager, but I‚Äôll make sure to remember it next time. Those eyes are hard to forget!      Has anyone else had a spontaneous encounter like this? Any tips for my next visit to Le Colonial?      I‚Äôd like to build a genuine connection with this beautiful woman while also respecting boundaries. üòà you never know...      Q1: What are some subtle, respectful ways to show her I'm interested without overstepping? Q2: Has anyone successfully turned a friendly connection into something more? How did you do it? Q3: Any tips for balancing persistence with respect in situations like this?</Content></post><post><Title>I wish you knew how much I cherish and miss you</Title><Author>u/BarelyConscious_</Author><Content>I think about you constantly.

One day while my bf and I were at my parents' house, I asked my mom to make me this "children's coffee" and my boyfriend asked me what that was and I explained the story behind it and how I used to drink it a lot when I was younger. That's where it all began.      Ffw a few weeks, we're at his mom's house and for a change there's soy milk in the fridge there (leftover from a family holiday we went on) so he asks me if I want children's coffee. Surprised, I asked him if he wanted to make it for me and he said yes. So obviously I agreed, it's a cute gesture. And it was good. Better than my mom's, even. Which is what I told him too. I guess from that point on it became his go-to act of service, because every single day when we're together he asks me if I want children's coffee, sometimes more than once a day too. Every time I say yes, because I can tell it makes him happy to make the coffees.      But here's the problem: his recipe tastes HORRIBLE with almond milk. At least the almond milk we have at my parents' house. My mom does not want soy milk in her house because of the estrogen, so this substitute is the only thing my bf could use for the coffee, but man it tastes bad. I'm talking "the flavor gives me a nauseated feeling if I drink more than half of it" kind of bad. Still, every time he prepares it for me in the morning, I force myself to drink it all. I've asked him to switch up the recipe a bit to accommodate for the different milk substitute, but it's like no matter what he does, each time it ends up tasting worse. But whenever he hands me that coffee mug with a proud smile on his face it's like he just handed me a cup of love, how could I not drink that?      There are many ways to get out of this situation. I am not afraid of being honest. I could easily tell him it just doesn't taste good with almond milk and he will not get upset. But I don't want to. I don't want him to stop doing this. It's almost like the bad flavor makes it better/sweeter? Sometimes I even consider asking him myself if he wants to make me that coffee, knowing it will taste bad. I guess that's just how love works.</Content></post><post><Title>My girlfriend‚Äôs family treats me better than my own family.</Title><Author>u/JakeOfSpades1</Author><Content>I 18m visit with my girlfriend 23f and her family and they‚Äôve treated me with absolutely kindness but my own family would insult my appearance, height, voice and anything else.

We‚Äôre not perfect so this won‚Äôt always be the case. Despite that why is it that some people go through a big issue and that somehow has more power over every single positive experience they went through combined?      I hope what I‚Äôm asking makes any kind of sense. I just see so many comments about how people are like ‚ÄúWelp there‚Äôs 25 years gone‚Äù But like, you spent so much time with this person!

Like, I get loving someone‚Äîyou appreciate who they are, you enjoy being around them, you feel loved and safe with them etc‚Äîbut how does that differ from being in love with them ie loving them romantically not platonically? For example, your best friend vs your romantic partner, you love both of them but other than (presumably) also being sexually attracted to your partner and not to your friend (would also appreciate if anyone has advice on what that actually means, is it literally looking at someone and having a desire to have sex with them?), is there a difference in how you feel about them?      I feel like there has to be since I know that there are plenty of asexual people or people who just otherwise aren't interested in sex who still fall in love and differentiate between romantic and platonic relationships, so clearly being "in love" with someone is different than just loving them. So what does being "in love" actually feel like?</Content></post><post><Title>What would be some good date ideas for a broke intern?</Title><Author>u/lucesh1</Author><Content>So basically I have around $50 to my name until end of the month (I'm an intern so I don't get paid).

I keep thinking about having sex with other girls all the time. I used to be a womanizer before being with her, and after two years I wanna go back to it.      Sometimes I masturbate seeing other girls instagrams and thinking about other girls. We haven't had sex for a month now, Im just not in the mood to have sex with her.      I really love her and we get along but im not sexually satisfied, im just used to having sex with a lot of girls and not just one, I never cheated on her and never will. The problem is she is SUPPER attached to me, I don't wanna hurt her, she would cry a lot and financially she is not very good. We live together in a nice apartment and the lease is not finished until MAY 2025, I was thinking leaving her then which would be much easier since we can part separate ways but im just not happy, and I don't wanna be stuck in a relationship I don't want for one more year.      I don't wanna make her unhappy and her to cry but at this point I am in the relationship because of her well being and not because of mine, I can't stop thinking about finishing the relationship not even for one day for the last 4 months. I don't know what to do. If I tell her that I wanna finish and tell her to get another apartment she would not leave. She can't afford this apartment that we are living now, I can afford it even being alone. She can't, so she would need to move to a cheaper place by herself, but she wont want to finish and when she starts crying im gonna feel bad and get back with her... it happened once before, I tried leaving her but I just felt so guilty seeing her crying so I stayed.      I just wanna experience what is to be single again. Maybe Im just not made for relationships...      what should I do?help )':      TLDR: I want but I emotionally can't leave my girlfriend even though im not happy. Live together, lease finishes in 1 year, I was thinking on waiting until then to part ways separate but im just no happy, I wanna experience to be single again.</Content></post><post><Title>I'd love to talk about my relationship to someone but I don't want to just leave an essay here.</Title><Author>u/SirMarvelAxolotl</Author><Content>I love my girlfriend so much and I just want to talk to someone about our relationship and ask questions if I need.

We hadn‚Äôt been together for very long, just a couple months, but we both knew it was very different from anything else we had experienced. We had unashamed conversations of marriage, children, homes, issues, exes, strengths, weaknesses and just what life would be like together. It felt so right, but not in a rose colored glasses way, in a very raw and vulnerable way.      One night we were at my house and we were drinking a little bit of wine, we went out to look at the stars and have a little smoke. We were in the middle of a silly conversation and he did a totally random 180 to ask me about what kind of tree growth my woods were (he works in forestry!). I laughed so hard and let the I love you I had been holding on the tip of my tongue for weeks slip. He just laughed along with me and the night continued without mention of what I said.      The next day rolls around and this part of the story gets a little confusing but I‚Äôll give the short version. Basically I had a friend who was friends with my partners ex girlfriend. That friend (m) liked to tell me(f) all the negative details of my partners past relationship. I hear another story from this friend and shoot my partner a text. (just to clarify we had been openly communicating about his previous relationship from day one prior to my friends input, as well as all of my previous relationships). I tell him that i heard more from my friend and would like to talk. He comes right over even though i was just expecting a phone call.      After we talked everything through we go outside again to let the dogs out. He starts apologizing for putting me through all of this drama because he knows it‚Äôs not really enjoyable for anyone involved. We talk a bit more and I just tell him that it‚Äôs okay, and I trust him, and that our relationship is what we make it and these things don‚Äôt have to influence us negatively, they can build us up. He says ‚ÄúI think I love you.‚Äù, and I tell him that ‚ÄúI know I love you.‚Äù‚Ä¶.      A day or two later we‚Äôre talking about it and HE NEVER HEARD MY I LOVE YOU FROM THE PREVIOUS NIGHT!!! He thought he was saying it first and I thought I had said it first.      I just find that to be the cutest thing. Neither of us were afraid of taking that first step. Everything was perfectly balanced and it makes me feel incredibly happy to think about.      He is my person.

He was forced now to work part time as well and began to reply late and he apologized saying he was busy working full time and part time.      I get that he was busy but i know him so well that i know he seems depressed although he didn't say anything to me. So, although i was not feeling it and was slightly hurt he really replies late, I still gave him a long message thanking him and letting him know i'm always here for him and that these things may have happened to him but I consoled him and told him that the Lord has better plans for him. I even told him sweet things like thanks for being a blessing etc. but he has yet to respond.      I have a rough idea that he is going through something but I thought my message will cheer him up. I swear my message I anticipate would touch him and make him cry but I guess not?      He is an emotional person and very caring towards me so this is odd that he is not responding even to say thanks. He even acts like my boyfriend sometimes and supports me emotionally.</Content></post><post><Title>My sweet little boy I'll carry you on my shoulders.</Title><Author>u/LookingThroughtheFog</Author><Content>I'll carry you on my shoulders      Two years ago today I felt your little heart beating as I held you in my arms. In that moment the future stretched out before me a whole ocean of possibilities awaited us. Your first smile your first laugh your first steps into the unknown.

But for now your small so I will carry you on my shoulders so you can see the world and the world can see you.      Two years ago today I felt your little heart stop beating as I held you in my arms . In that moment the future shattered like a pane of glass and the ocean of possibilities dried up. Tears flowed then as uncontrollable as they do now and if I didn't have your siblings I would've followed you. But I can't yet because as a father I have to much still to do your mother needs me as do your siblings and my job is not yet done I don't have the luxury of saying I'm done.

I've never been a religious man but I have no doubt in my heart I will see you again I don't have the strength in me to let go of that belief.

I feel so lucky sometimes to be in love again and this time, it is really amazing. My first ever relationship/love I dated a guy from 17 to 27 and he was my soul mate at the time. I loved him and I know he loved me but we grew apart as we got older in our 20s. After that I thought that I had my one great love in my life. I went back to school and didn't date so I wasn't distracted. At 32 I graduated and promised myself I'd start dating because lonleyness was starting to bring me real down. I went on a dating app and met this guy. He was the first one I went on a date with and now 8 months later we still text everyday about he asked me to move in in 2 months.      I'm so in love and I just want to talk and write about to somewhere. I love this man, I'm so in love with how he treats me and the things he does and says. He is just the best. The company is wonderful. The sex is the best its ever been. He treats me so amazingly and does such nice things for me.      I always told myself that I had my one great love in my life already and that I was lucky to have that and didn't think I'd have love again.  But wow. Its so much better. Its amazing. I wish there was bigger words then I love you that I could tell him. I'm so happy in life right now that while I'm traveling for a bridesmaids party and my heart feel sick trying to fall asleep so far away from him. I hate it. I wish there was some way to turn off the love sickness. I can't wait to see him again.</Content></post><post><Title>Still very happy to not only have made a best friend, but also learned she is one of my platonic soulmates (my first at least)</Title><Author>u/Bandock666</Author><Content>I (36M) am very glad I was able to preserve this special bond with my best friend (45F).  She even decided to name me her best man (or man of honor) whenever she gets married.  That's honestly one of the greatest honors to be given and I appreciate it a great deal.  I still love her to this day, at least as a person (not romantically, but platonically).  I learned she was my platonic soulmate since December 2023, though did take me time to confirm it and share with her.      I have made many friends online, but this one in particular is unlike any other I have made.  The fact I learned she is my platonic soulmate makes it more special.  Even though I know how to find my own happiness; it's great to have someone be a special addition like her.  It's incredible to know someone who thinks on a very similar wavelength, able to connect very quickly, very similar values, etc.  Again, I appreciate her a great deal. ü•∞      If you have one or more platonic soulmates you truly appreciate, feel free to share. üòâ</Content></post><post><Title>What does my gf mean when she says she likes my hands and legs?</Title><Author>u/DystopicLasagna</Author><Content>Exactly what it sounds like.

During the next two failed relationships, he was somewhat correct; I felt I had fumbled the one man I had an authentic, non-forced romantic relationship with to try and force relationships with men who weren‚Äôt truly in love with me or compatible. During the most recent failed relationship, I told myself that at 30, I had to settle for a less-than-ideal relationship, because I had already experienced one relationship with a man who was head over heels for me.      In my early 30s, I‚Äôm in a relationship where I feel secure and where my partner regularly approves he genuinely adores me. Nothing was forced, everything progressed naturally. I‚Äôm a more mature and emotionally independent person than I was when I was engaged; that relationship was doomed to fail because of my own immaturity, toxicity and codependence, but that doesn‚Äôt mean what I experienced then wasn‚Äôt true love, nor does it detract from the love I‚Äôm experiencing now.

Most days consist of me getting off work and going to either her place or mine where she will be waiting for me. Then we go to the gym and either cook or get food. After that it‚Äôs yk what time then we shower and watch tv together. It‚Äôs so simple and mundane but so meaningful. I can talk to her about anything and she just gets me and vice versa. She is the most beautiful amazing woman I‚Äôve ever met and I‚Äôm so excited for our future. We will be moving in together near the end of the summer and I haven‚Äôt been this excited for anything in so long. She‚Äôs already started picking out decorations and furniture; it‚Äôs so adorable. She tells me she loves me at least 50 times a day. We‚Äôre both young and started supporting ourselves younger than most so it‚Äôs so nice to be with someone who understands the challenges that comes with. I would do anything for this girl.

You‚Äôll know that no matter what, I will still hold you, kiss you on the forehead, and tell you that I‚Äôve got you. My dear, I make this vow to you.      I vow to sacrifice for you. I vow to lift you up and permanently spin you around in a dance of love. I vow to stay by your side until your very last breath.

Sometimes, I realize that my brother could be an angel; he's so overwhelmingly kind, his voice tone and even his typing style is unusually relaxing and comforting.      He's also cared for my emotions and well-being, I know he won't be revengeful and vindictive with my things, our parents would've preferred to speak out anything agaisnt me. He doesn't take his stress and his bad feelings out of me, and if he will, I know he's a human being with slip-ups but it will never be intentional, a routine or a second nature.      He's going to accept me, he's already suspected but accepted me anyway even if nothing is confirmed.

He's defended me when I thought he would've never dared to protest agaisnt his first most beloved person who was the one mistreating me the most.

Monday spiraling .</Title><Author>u/Icy_Teaching_7092</Author><Content>I went to a beautiful wedding with love , joy, exciment, family, dancing, food, drinks , music and laughter.  My brother got married this past weekend,  and I'm so happy for him . Little did I know a wedding would break me down , and it did Monday night. Sunday I was exhausted after getting home after it , swollen feet , and sleep deprived . Monday became a Monday for no reason, and it hit like a tidal wave .  I cleaned my car out and vacuumed it out . My dad was being annoying bc he just had to see how good of a job I did on my own car . He wanted to " Inspect " it . I said no your not seeing the inside of my car , I bought it and pay for it . He returned with being petty and on my case about stuff . I asked him where I could get my state inspection done , he wasn't a help . Every Monday is trash day .... he is an odd ball about it . I did the dishes after dinner and I apparently had to take the trash out asap .  I was over his attitude mostly. It hit me the wrong way , and then my bf ... I wanted to see him . I offered to get dinner and drinks and I didn't get a response till later on . It was too late to go out with him bc my dad was also making dinner at the time . I was just over the whole day , and I was still exhausted.  I got to see my bf today for lunch on his break , and it was nice . Last night I just bawled.  I bawled like a baby , bc I was over the wedding stuff , my ex husband didn't want to do a huge thing for us getting married, and I guess again grieving in a way . Grieving bc I didn't have a big wedding, grieving bc of a lot back then.  I'm not sure if it was any sort of a trigger , but damn it.  My bf called me tonight like usual , and he is making me dinner , washed the bed sheets and wants to go to the beach for sunset tomorrow . I mentioned that I see him once a week , and it kills me . He offered to spend time with me this weekend as well,  and tomorrow night.  Sometimes , I forget that I have someone who actually cares and loves me . I felt a disconnect from him, but I over think . My gut feelings weren't screaming,  just my heart was aching . I really was sad and mad at the world . I tried to call my bestie , bc she usually helps me figure shit out . I think I understand why I was upset and what I needed.  Long story short , I feel better and get to be spoiled tomorrow night . Oh and the hot water heater blew... so a cold shower is a must tomorrow yay .</Content></post><post><Title>People who are very happily married, when did you start to imagine a future with that person?</Title><Author>u/WeeklyDamage8006</Author><Content>I‚Äôve heard the phrase ‚Äúif they don‚Äôt imagine a future with you from day one, they never will‚Äù. How true is that really? In my case, if I really like someone I will start to fantasize about a life together but it‚Äôs more in the fun of getting to know each other. It isn‚Äôt like I‚Äôd actually marry them after a month but the idea is there. It‚Äôs like excitement, not love bombing or anything drastic.      Are there people who didn‚Äôt have those thoughts until months or years later and everything is okay?      Additional question: for those of you that were nervous about rushing into things, like the people who get nervous thinking of marriage or buying a ring, what made you change your mind?      Asking this as someone who has never had a guy love bomb or vocalize thoughts like this and it‚Äôs making me a little nervous about that phrase.      EDIT: thanks everyone for the replies! It‚Äôs so sweet to see how you all talk about your loved ones.

We only dated a few weeks and I thought I'd be over you by now, but I'm not. It's about to be two months soon. I know you most likely still don't feel the same way. I know you are just trying to figure out what you want. That is not something I want to rush, although a part of me is still holding on to the hope that you'll decide you want to be with me. Things happen for a reason and maybe us breaking up and deciding to be friends was a way of God saying not now or he's not the right person at the moment. I'm trying my best to stop thinking about you although we text often and send reels a lot. I try not to be as excited to see your name pop up on my screen. You did make me happy, but it's all you. I'm just a hopeless romantic with my heart slowly repairing itself. Thanks for letting me talk to you about what has gone on in my life that made me who you see today. I know it's pointless to hold on to these feelings and I'm trying to let go of them, but that is difficult. I hope whoever you decide to be with one day knows how lucky they are to have you.

To me you are the golden beams of sunlight peeking through emerald treetops on a summers evening. You‚Äôre the nostalgia of childhood; The long lasting happy memories of being young and carefree. You are the joyful exclamation, ‚Äòthe best day ever!‚Äô In you I see patterns perfectly aligned. I see colours a shade brighter. In you I see raindrops turn to falling diamonds. I see natures finest beauty. A heart of the most precious gold. A soul in his purest form. In fact I know that you‚Äôre one of a kind. In you I see life, I see everything that makes life worth living. In you, I see my life. I see me spending it with you. I see a locket of your heart with my photo placed in its delicate frame.

I'm just trying to get close to you.</Title><Author>u/BrookieD820</Author><Content>You and I have been friends for a while. Then we started fooling around.  It was all so new to me even at my age.  I know you've had limited relationship experience too and that your last one ended tragically. We'd been getting really close, really fast and the intensity of our physical relationship has been a whirlwind.      Three weeks ago, that changed when we spent the night together for the first time.  You were super sweet for the next two days and then you became cold and shut me out.  You told mutual friends of ours that you needed time.  This was obviously becoming more than a FWB thing and you freaked. You promised me you wouldn't run for the hills. Since then, you keep reaching out to me but not making plans with me to talk about any of this, or called me. I keep trying to be patient. We have such amazing chemistry, it's easy being with you.  I have given more of myself to you than I have to anybody else in my entire life. You could have just told me you needed a breather, I would have been fine.      I just want you. I want to get close to you. You said I was beautiful, that you wanted me, that you loved being with me.  You call me sweetie and hold my hand, you took a day off work to spend time with me. And now we're nowhere. Do you even miss me?      What are you so scared of? Somebody loving you? I am trying, but I can't put myself through this for much longer. All I've been asking for is for us to sit down and talk about this to see if we can move forward and I can't even get that.      You are breaking my heart.</Content></post><post><Title>Throwback to a week ago when I texted my boyfriend from work and told him I was having a hard day.

I remember everything about us so clearly, yet it already feels like it was years and years ago. Time slowed down and I spend it either thinking of you or distracting myself.      Either way I can't catch my breath.      And I feel so stupid because you probably forgot what day is today. You probably already forgot what we were.      To you, mine was just a role, right? No matter who takes it.      I finally had a stable and well paid job. I was gonna get us a new home. Everything seemed perfect at first.      But I guess the taller, toxic guy with a random job who lived close to you was even better.      How can I start loving somebody else as easily as you did? You have fun with him while I keep dreaming of you at night.      In my dreams I can see you, talk with you, hug you, lay on a bed with you. Everything feels better. Then I wake up, and everything feels worse than before. I begin asking myself, why should I even get up from bed and work?      Yeah, for myself. To keep my life going. But who's giving me back the one half you took away from me?      It's as if I never existed in the first place, and I hate you for what you've done to me.      Still.      You will always be family to me.      If you ever come back, I'll surely fall for it.      I tell myself I should consider you dead, but I'm so afraid of seeing your ghost with him.</Content></post><post><Title>everyday i fall more and more in love with my boyfriend and it‚Äôs only been 4 months</Title><Author>u/No_Acadia_8502</Author><Content>i‚Äôve known him since 2016 but the love i have for him is so strong. is this normal? he‚Äôs amazing with my daughter, he loves me, we have the most passionate and intense sexual chemistry, everything about him makes me so happy and i‚Äôm so deeply in love with him it often scares me. it‚Äôs not lust, right? he‚Äôs my best friend and the love of my life in one and i‚Äôm so grateful for him.</Content></post><post><Title>I Wanted To Share With The World.

It showed me the importance of waiting for someone who would love me fully and unconditionally.      When I think about what I hoped for in a partner, she surpasses every expectation. Her love has shown me a happiness that feels almost otherworldly, an emotional connection that I didn‚Äôt know was possible. Every moment with her feels like a gift, a constant reminder of how wonderful life can be when shared with someone as special as her.      She‚Äôs given me more than just love; she‚Äôs given me a reason to wake up with a smile, to look forward to each new day, and to feel truly alive. The way she cares for me, understands me, and brings light into my life is something I never imagined I could have, something I never imagined I deserved.      She is my dream come true, my best friend, and I am endlessly thankful for the love we share. The depth of our connection leaves me in awe, and I am so grateful for the beautiful journey we are on together.      I simply wanted to share the joy of what true love is, what I think true love should always feel like.      I pray you all find the kind of love I have found in this lifetime and in the next.

We started talking in November, I told him I love him once a couple of months ago and I was happy with his response that he wasn‚Äôt ready to say it yet but he has really strong feelings for me.      He travels for work, usually a week or so at a time but this trip is only a day or two and I‚Äôm at his house. He woke me this morning and as he was leaving he said ‚ÄúI love you‚Äù my half asleep brain didn‚Äôt process it immediately so I said ‚Äúbe safe‚Äù      Now I‚Äôm questioning if it was a slip or if he meant it. I won‚Äôt have this conversation through the phone so I‚Äôm waiting till probably tomorrow night for him to get home.      I feel like a teenager lol I do love him but I never said it regularly after the first time because I don‚Äôt want to put pressure on him.      For a little context we both had really damaging long relationships before meeting. My husband was abusive and passed away and his ex seems to have been verbally and mentally abusive toward him. (I only know his side of the story but he included his wrongs when telling me about their past).      All I can do is laugh right now about how I‚Äôve reverted to high school girl mentality over this man.

He's so much fun to be around, always making me laugh and smile. I love playing video games with him, he's so amazing at whatever he plays it's so cool to watch him play.      He is so incredibly beautiful and handsome, his cute curly hair or his adorable brown eyes I could get lost into forever. His pretty little round face which is soooo cute. And his perfect body that I love to cuddle up against and hug so tightly.      He loves me for who I am, and never asks me to change. Always so respectful of what I want and need. I know he'd do anything for me, just like I'd do absolutely anything for him.      He's perfect, and the day I met him is the happiest day of my life.

Two of the least toxic relationships I had still weren‚Äôt healthy, one because he sold drugs and I was a 17 year old with a drug problem due to being homeless and the second was addicted to ketamine so it came with problems, but they were both nice to me.      Every other relationship I have been in as been abusive. I‚Äôve been with narcissists, people who‚Äôve emotionally, physically and sexually abusive to me.      For the last few months I‚Äôve been dating a lovely man. Not a drug addict, looks like a model, he‚Äôs sooo kind and respectful of women, owns his own business, never shouts or takes his anger out on me. Shows me love and affection. I met him through one of my friends of 16 years who has vetted him and told him he‚Äôs good for me and tried to set us up.      He accepts me whole heartedly and is supportive. My mum passed away and he supported me all the way through it and came to the funeral, he‚Äôs generous with me and showers me with adoration and wants to spend as much time with me as possible.      One of my close friends told my other friend, I‚Äôm looking forward to meeting him because he seems good for her. This other friend also knew of him, he said ‚Äúhe had a healthy relationship with with his ex, but (my name) has only been in toxic relationships‚Äù it made me feel that most people think I‚Äôm at fault for being abused in relationships. I feel relieved that I‚Äôll be in a healthy relationship and won‚Äôt be victim blamed or villainised for the abuse I‚Äôve endured, this will be the relationship that maybe will wake people up that I‚Äôm not the problem other than condoning it for too long.      I feel so lucky to have found such a loving kind person after living a lifetime with the opposite.      üôè</Content></post><post><Title>Waiting for Superman.

They'd understand it and take it in subconsciously. I used to sneak into my dads room and whisper to him that he should buy me new toys. Fun times.      Nowadays I don't know if I believe it. But when my boyfriend is asleep I like to whisper things to him.      I tell him how amazing he is, how beautiful he is. Sometimes I just tell him he should be proud of himself, or he is really good at his hobbies or job. The other day he got his 8th platinum achievement on PlayStation and when he was asleep I kept going on about how cool he was, that he is awesome at video games and he can definitely make it to 10 (his goal)      He wakes up sometimes, laughs a bit and gives me a cuddle. Never remembers it in the morning.      I don't know if it works. But I hope it does. Because he deserves to know how amazing he is.      EDIT : I am a man. We are gay.

I got so lucky to meet someone as amazing as my partner ü•∞</Title><Author>u/Traditional_Set_858</Author><Content>So l was definitely a late bloomer as I only had one very short term boyfriend at 22 and I wouldn't even consider that relationship experience because it really wasn't like a relationship at all. It wasn't until I was 25 when I finally decided to put myself out there as I really wanted to experience being in love as I had never experienced it.      I eventually caved and downloaded Tinder and literally within 2 weeks I had met my amazing partner and went on our first date and a week later we were officially a couple. It was completely out of character for me to go so quickly into a relationship but it just felt natural and it was one of those things where it just felt right to take the chance.      We've now been together for a year and a half and I definitely can say I found my person. We not only have similar interests but we get along so well and really understand each other. He does everything he can to make sure I'm happy in the relationship and occasionally asks if there's any issues or concerns I have. He does little things for me like take out the trash, surprise me with little things like Starbucks, or offers to get me food delivered if I'm not feeling well. He also took me to his home country and I got to meet his family and I just felt so welcomed and it was so nice to see where he grew up.      I never thought l'd love someone so much that I'm willing to spend a little time everyday learning a new language. It literally feels like I won the lottery with this man as I can't believe that not only was he single when I met him but that he chose me out everyone else.

He came for my prom and when I say I‚Äôve never felt so in love I mean it.      The whole time I felt like we were the only people there and I couldn‚Äôt stop looking at him. He was so affectionate and calling me perfect and ‚Äúmore beautiful in person‚Äù and be was so patient about everything including our first kiss, which made me like him 1000x more. I think we touched foreheads about 5 times trying to go for the first kiss but I kept backing out LOL. After the first one, the rest were so easy. He was complimenting me all night and hugging me every second and kissing all over my forehead and cheek and neck but I loved that I could tell it was endearing and not sexual. Like I literally FELT the affection radiating off of him. On the dance floor we were hugging and I was leaning back on him and he just stayed there for me even tho he HATES dancing and swore off of it. He spent 60% of the night there for me, which I‚Äôm very grateful for.      His smile was so genuine and he would look at me and ask for a kiss over and over it was so cute dude. Everything physical he took his time w, which btw didnt go far but like what we did do he was so gentle with and asked ‚Äúcan I‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..‚Äù ‚Äúyes or no?‚Äù I found it so adorable in the moment. ik it‚Äôs bare minimum but it‚Äôs just a relief and honestly blessing knowing he cares how I feel in the moment and thinks about me when he‚Äôs horny ig? üò≠      Like seriously, even our tongue kiss was so gentle. I was so nervous and he was like ‚Äúfor one second, I‚Äôll teach you,‚Äù and not in a demanding way but more question and care. I did it and then did it 1-2 more times for a couple seconds and got embarrassed and dug my head into his chest bc I thought I was doing really bad, and then I just like mumbled ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know what to do or how to do it..‚Äù and he reassured me the second after and was saying ‚Äúnooooo it was good‚Ä¶.baby it was perfect, I swear.‚Äù and I was blushing the WHOLE TIME.      Anyways, after the bus ride back and cute I just kinda laid on his shoulder and almost passed out on his lap bc I was so exhausted and we took a drive to Dave and busters but he had to leave early, sadly. I think one of the cutest things was him saying ‚Äúthe pictures please, the PhotoBooth and card‚Äù bc I had taken a picture for us and made us save each others table cards and him remembering and saying it in the actual most adorable voice, not like a baby but like imagine a grown man or deep voiced guy just saying it so softly. Then he said I love you and I‚Äôll miss you and we kissed goodbye üôÅ.      Now, I‚Äôm going to his house in a week or two for his pool and we‚Äôre gonna have fun in there there watch a movie together and cuddle in our matching pjs and build a lego set I bought us.      I‚Äôm so happy so have stuck through the long year of petty fights and lack of touch bc it was all worth it. Our 15 months is in 6 days, it feels surreal.

This happened early on in our relationship, a little under four years ago.      When we met my guy was starting his recovery from a serious meth addiction and as you can imagine I didn‚Äôt want to be involved with that, at all. So even though we had a serious connection I kept turning him down because I didn‚Äôt want to take any chances there, but after about six months of getting to know him I finally broke down and kissed him.      We got together, and things were great. Then about six more months into our relationship there was one bad day where he wasn‚Äôt acting like himself and he was out hanging out with some guys I didn‚Äôt know, and I ended up finding $40 missing from my bank account.      When I confronted him about it he admitted what he‚Äôd done. And I took my time to think about what that meant to me, because obviously I couldn‚Äôt just ignore what had happened. I definitely wasn‚Äôt going to just sit there and let him do things like that, to me or to himself. I wasn‚Äôt going to be an enabler and I wasn‚Äôt going to tie myself to that.      So I took him and sat him down. And I explained that I knew he was recovering from a serious addiction and because of that I was going to forgive him for what had happened.      And I also explained that I would give him two years. I wouldn‚Äôt commit to anything serious in that time, but if he could stay completely clean and sober it would show me that he was serious about our relationship. And to show him I was just as serious, I said that if he could do that, I would marry him.      Now, four years later, he‚Äôs still completely sober and we‚Äôre engaged and I can say without a doubt that giving him a second chance that night was absolutely the best decision I have ever made. He is the love of my life. He never hesitates to tell me how beautiful I am or how much he loves me, and when I‚Äôm feeling bad he always does everything he possibly can to make me feel better. He is my world.</Content></post><post><Title>My loving partner knows exactly when I need him the most!</Title><Author>u/Yorkie_Mom_2</Author><Content>My son passed away suddenly eight months ago (I promise this is relevant to this story). I met my partner two months later. My partner is the love of my life -- the best man I've ever met. We fell in love within two or three weeks of meeting, and our love continues to grow. He is an amazing partner! He shows his love in ways I never dreamed possible (including bringing me breakfast in bed a couple of times a week).      Tonight we were working here in the study. We each have a computer in here, and there is also a bed for napping. Just before I moved here two months ago, he set up Apple Home using Siri. One of Siri's skills is to play music all over the house when we ask her to. As we are both working at our computers, listening to music, the song "In the Arms of the Angels" starts to play. My wonderful, loving partner knew that song would trigger intense grief in me and make me cry. As soon as it started playing, he stood up, came to my computer, put his arms around me and said, "Come on, let's go snuggle." I was already crying. My partner led me to the bed, pulled me into his arms, told Siri to stop the music, held me, and talked to me about my son until I stopped crying.      I have never felt so loved.

But then on the other those very same individuals get too scared/timid to actually let others in on real emotionally intimate level.      How can someone be loved unconditionally if they don't show who they truly are to others? When I say this I mean, their fears, insecurities, and doubts in the moment as well as the positives. So many go out their way to protect their own ego that they hurt those willing to want to love them for who they are. I do think a lot is because of issues with perfectionism and what it means to be attractive.      It's scary to actually put yourself truly on the line like that. But by doing so makes you a fantasticaslly strong individual. To accept and understand that you are a perfectly imperfect individual takes a lot of strength, and through that strength is being vulnerable you can have a chance at unconditional love.

We don‚Äôt talk on the phone as much as we use to. We sometimes go on friendly outings. I still do my best in showing my appreciating for her in anyway I could think of.      I just really want to say how proud I am of her. I‚Äôm proud everything she‚Äôs been able to achieve; before we met and after we met.      I look at the casual photos I love taking of her and I think she‚Äôs so sexy, so inspiring, so beautiful, and so intelligent. She‚Äôs off the radar bro. She‚Äôs crazy to think she‚Äôs ugly if she really believes that. I seriously love this women. I love to see her laugh. I love when it‚Äôs me making her laugh. I love the way she walks. I even love when she‚Äôs nagging, I don‚Äôt mean it in any disrespectful way. For example, when she tries to convince me to take cab home instead of walking home at night and she‚Äôs super serious but I still decide to walk home, because overall I live like 15 blocks away lol.      I love her nose. I love her big eyes. I love her hair. I love her forehead. I love the smudged oval  birthmark on the right side of her face. I love when shes eating. I love her fingernails. I love her toes. I love her belly. I love her family to because they are good people. I love when the hairs on her legs are growing. I love her kisses when she use to give me some. I super love her hugs and when it lasts for more than 10 seconds. I love her style. I love her charisma. I love how funny she is. I love her principles. I love her dog. I literally can go on and on. I love how she just a boss. I love her being anal about having matching sheets. I love how she‚Äôs always trying to evolve. From upgrading her standard toothbrush to an electric one üò≠ or just taking care of herself and her needs.      Shit I love she broke up with me because I totally respect that and respect her. At this point, i think I can care less if she gets back with me. It would hurt, yes, if she decided to move on entirely and we don‚Äôt talk anymore but part of me is just so grateful to be in her presence still and show her, even though we are friends, how much I still appreciate her. I can never convince myself things I hate about her. I‚Äôm here for her until whenever. I won‚Äôt let her go. I wish I was Superman and I could sweep her off her feet and fly her out of earth and show her the stars and planets. I will try my best to show it every chance I get to show and prove to her. I Need to use my brain and show her it‚Äôs more than the dates, the past sex, etc. I really can‚Äôt explain it but I just love the time she gives me, the care she had for me, everything yo. That‚Äôs my women still until she leaves me for good. I ain‚Äôt going no where g. I stand firm in that.</Content></post><post><Title>For 30 Years, I loved with contempt. My ex wife despised me.</Title><Author>u/saffermaster</Author><Content>After a few years licking my wounds, I put myself out there at age 55, trying to find love. I spent 4 years enjoying kinky sex with women of every age. From 18 to 60. Nothing I did could fill the emptiness I felt in my broken heart. One woman I dated shared with me that in spite of my sense of failure, that she found me imminently lovable. Another lover told me that I am too distant and "You need to let me in,"      I went out and got a tattoo on my chest that took 7 months to complete. It captured my sense that attraction was possible, that there was a certain randomity to the world, that we lived in an endless universe and that I am lovable. Its a cool trash punk tattoo.      I looked hard at what was missing from my marriage. It occurred to me that intimacy was missing.      One day I got a message from a woman on a kink site who saw my "seeking post". She was as kinky as me and also looking for intimacy and we started a dialogue. We courted for 6 months before we began our dynamic formally. That was 6 years ago.      in 6 days I am going to marry her. I could not be happier. We not only found love, we fell in love and have had a steamy love affair that goes on and on. I am so here for it.      Its possible to find love. I can guarantee that there is love after divorce. My life is poetry.      Update:      Kink is interesting. People of all ages participate. There are kids who learn about kink at a very young age, and are perhaps more ready to explore kink when they get to age 18 than others are till much later in life. One thing about being Dom in a kink setting like a club or munch is that submissives of all ages and genders approach you and negotiate a scene with you. Remember, all kink is based on consent, not persuasion, informed enthusiastic consent. I should have noted that I practice RACK which is Risk-Aware Consensual Kink, and SSC, Safe, Sane Consensual Kink. I get the idea that morality has it that young adults should not play with old adults, but that is simply your own ick, nobody else's. We have a saying in kink, "I'm not going to yuck on your yum"</Content></post><post><Title>Friday, I'm in love...! TELL US ABOUT YOUR CRUSHES &amp;amp; DATES!

He made me a personalized diary in which he wrote about his life, his days, his feelings for me, his love for me, the future and other random curiousities about himself and the country he lives in. I am beyond words as to how I deserved this man. We click so well and have been doing this long distance thing for a good few months already and I can't wait to only make it better.

We made our relationship official in April, so I like to think we took it pretty slow. In every other relationship I have ever had, I felt the need to be so careful about my body, my choices, and never felt at home with my partners. I always was waiting for the next step of where I was going to go to next. I made sure that we used multiple forms of protection when we were intimate. I never felt like I could be my sensitive, extroverted self fully. Before we became romantic, he helped me pass the final course I needed for my first degree. I had been calling my "Rave Husband", because we were always attached at the hip at the many raves we stuffed into a year. He spent the day with me after I had emergency surgery, just so I wouldn't be alone. He is one of the only people that has ever made an effort to celebrate my birthday. He got out of his car when I did, because he thought he was going to have to pull me off of some guy in front of a bar, and still decided to want me. He watched me projectile vomit outside of a show in 100 degree weather, and left early with me, and cuddled me while I looked like a drowned sewer rat months long before he declared his feelings. With this man??? I told this man today that I trust him enough to decide when and if he ever wants to put a baby in me. I told this man that I would provide for him whatever he desires in this world and then more. I made this man know I intend on marrying him and making sure that he smiles every day for the rest of his life. I let this man do things to me today that I would have never allowed anyone else do. Suddenly, just like magic, I would give him everything I am and still be searching for more to give him. Every day, I find out more about him that makes my love grow even bigger. I sat in my bedroom for hours today waiting for him to call on his work break, in shock with myself at the words that had come out of my mouth to him before he had left. Never in my life have I been down this bad for someone. Every day it gets worse. I grieve for the time in this life that I won't get to spend with him. I have never wanted to just spend a day laying around with someone. It's like I have been possessed. Somehow, I have known my best friend for over a year now and the love I have for him only continues to grow exponentially with time that I fear I may one day explode.

It kills me every eye waking moment. I can‚Äôt stop thinking about how you may be slowly falling out of love for me and how our connection is less than what we had before. It makes me second guess everything and our relationship. Questions like Did you ever love me? Ofc you did. You stood by me when things were stressful. Your actions are louder than words, yet I think maybe you did not love me much as you thought. It‚Äôs fine, I just hate to think I‚Äôm not your person and you aren‚Äôt mine.  Why aren‚Äôt we trying to reconcile this? I mean we‚Äôre friends still so is that what that is? You said you were firm in your decision in not getting back with me. I try not to let it bother me; not cling to our little memories we had and not push away the fact you may over and done with me. I‚Äôm trying to experience the gift of life without fighting it. Yet my will is strong in not letting you go. New beginnings?      Why do I feel that you‚Äôre going to eventually leave me once you find discover a new connection? It‚Äôs ideal. Is our friendship ideal?. Wishes of my life in order so that we can shine in gold and sparkle in the night time. We take it all off and we still shine.      I‚Äôm sorry I ever pursued you and I wasn‚Äôt ready yet I don‚Äôt feel bad, how could I be? You allowed me to feel a feeling I never felt before. I  wish you can run to me when your heart feels heavy and lean your head on my shoulder. We had sex once after the break up and I wish you wanted my love more than you lust for sex at the moment? Is that a valid statement to say? Maybe you do want my love but baby I want all of you not just part of you. Please come home and sit still inside me because I would hate to see you come and go. Until you find someone new‚Ä¶ I‚Äôll be here‚Ä¶ until you find someone new Ill be here.      I just wanted to make you know how I feel although it may bug you I‚Äôm overthinking. I just wish things were different. I know you may feel different. I love you for it regardless. I love to see you prosper with or without me. It hurts but baby I‚Äôm here in the back of the ceremony rooting for you, so happy for you, I know your eyes are fixed on someone new and other things so you don‚Äôt notice me and that‚Äôs fine, here I am, happy for your accomplishments. I will forever love you as long as I know who I am and the love I have experienced. I will always pray for you and your family as I have been doing. Thank you for reading this. You don‚Äôt have to talk about anything I said.      Sincerely,      the boy who dreams countless lucid dreams and with you by my side, for infinity. Give me your hand and let me put a ring on it, forever kiss it. I can never break this bond even when you come crashing like thunderstorms from the southern states to the Great Plains.</Content></post><post><Title>My partner came to find me at 5am when I couldn't sleep and gave me his favourite stuffed toy</Title><Author>u/Apprehensive_Low6883</Author><Content>I struggle to sleep a lot and if I can't go back to sleep after a while, I just suck it up and start looking at my phone. If my partner is in bed with me asleep I'll leave the bed to sleep on the sofa because I don't want my movement and lights to keep him up.      He doesn't really like waking up without me so I try to sneak into bed before he gets up, but I can't always do it.      Anyway last night I fell asleep on the sofa and I was scrolling from about 2-5 AM. He came in about 5 with his favourite stuffed toy, he was in a daze a bit but said "aww are you up? I thought I'd give you (toys name) for company."      Then he asked me to come back to bed and we cuddled for a bit. It's just really nice. I never ever thought I'd find someone like this.</Content></post><post><Title>A Visual Representation Depicting the Impact of True Love on Our Very Beings</Title><Author>u/TestingTheWatersKY</Author><Content>No content</Content></post><post><Title>A little story of how I met the girl I‚Äôve been talking to.</Title><Author>u/Zealousideal_Ad321</Author><Content>Sorry, this will be long, but very worth the read. The feeling of new love is so euphoric, I just have to share. We have decided not to put a label on what we have going on, so I don‚Äôt consider her my girlfriend by any means. I broke up with an ex of 1 year about a month and a half ago, and since about 4 weeks ago, me and this girl have been talking more than before, and hanging out. I never even thought about flirting or making a move, because I was in the process of getting out of a relationship I felt stuck in. More than anyone else, she helped me understand what was wrong with my relationship and would always give pointers on how to make relationships more successful. I had given up on love. For months before I broke up with my ex, me and this girl talked all the time about love. I explained to her many many times that I‚Äôve lost faith in relationships. My ex of 5 years cheated on me along with physical abuse. My ex after that started acting like my other ex(very violent) and I decided that no one should ever feel threatened by their partner, even if they haven‚Äôt taken a swing yet. This girl explained to me that life is about taking chances and dating shouldn‚Äôt be ruled out just yet. Always kind of hinting at the thought of us being together. I work as a CNA in a long term care facility and she does the same PRN. We don‚Äôt work together much, but everytime we have, it seems like every one of our coworkers seem to think we were together. It‚Äôs not just our coworkers, the residents we take care of hint at it and tease us both about dating each other. A week or so after I broke up with my ex, I was on the phone with her. We talked about what went wrong and why I had bad luck with dating before. She kept expressing to not lose hope. The next day we worked together and while we were changing residents/doing vitals etc, she kept sort of bumping into me. She would stand really close when we talked and never took her eye off me. I knew what was happening and I wasn‚Äôt about to let my insecurities pass this off. We started talking about taking it super slow in a relationship being the best choice. She mentions she wouldn‚Äôt mind doing something like that and I say the same. To hang out, talk all the time, whatever couples do, just not labeling it. We figure that‚Äôs the best way to do things, except that we‚Äôve already knew each other for 11 months that I‚Äôve been working with her and have became very good friends. When she brings this up I knew for a fact that she wanted to go out with me, so I asked her if she wanted to come have some drinks and watch some movies at my house. She very quickly agreed and we made a date to hang out. When the time comes, she shows up at my house, like an hour late(she had a good excuse) and we start talking. We put on a movie but not a second of it was watched. We just talked and talked. I knew I couldn‚Äôt chicken out and not make a move, and I also knew that with her being very shy, there was no way she was going to make a move. Everytime I got up from the couch to grab another beer or make her a drink, I would sit closer and closer when I got back to the couch. At this point I‚Äôve had 2 or 3 beers and I was starting to feel my intuition slip away. Even if she tells me she doesn‚Äôt like me like that, I‚Äôll be able to defend my actions and apologize, so what‚Äôs to lose? I had this overwhelming feeling that I misunderstood all of our talks and all the hints, all the things residents and coworkers have said. I felt like she wasn‚Äôt comfortable and that I was going to make a big mistake if I were to make a move.  After making her a drink and sitting down right next to her, were our arms are touching, I throw my arm around her and she sinks into me, holding me, like she‚Äôs been waiting 11 months for this. I‚Äôve never felt so exhilarated in my life. I figured I‚Äôve got it in the bag, so I lean in to kiss her and she grabs my face and pulls it closer. We ended up making out for quite some time before she had to leave for work in the morning. I felt very very happy about this and high on life. Within a couple days we had already set up another time for us to hang out. I decided we should go on a hike, then back to my house. That was very successful as well and I felt like there was nothing stopping us from continuing this. She‚Äôs been on vacation for the last 2 weeks but we plan to go camping next Wednesday and Thursday on an island. We have so much in common and she is absolutely stunning. I can‚Äôt mess this up, but I at least know for sure that even if it doesn‚Äôt work out, we will still be great friends.

It's been a while since we last spoke, and I've been doing some reflecting lately &amp;amp; really for a long while now. There are memories we shared together that I still hold dear.      I wanted to take a moment to reach out and check in on you. Life has its up and downs, but I often find myself thinking about the times we spent together and the joy it brought me.      I know we've both moved on with our lives, but that doesn't diminish the significance of the impact you had on me. I just wanted you to know that I'm grateful for the time we had together even though short lived and the person you helped me become. Not to toot my own horn but I am pretty proud of the person I am today &amp;amp; in one way or another you had part into shaping who I am today.      The last time I attempted to rekindle our relationship/friendship, I know it didn‚Äôt end well. There were some assumptions that were made and although rightfully so, I never had the chance to explain myself or explain the misunderstanding. It‚Äôs been such a long time since so it may be irrelevant today but I wanted to reach out nonetheless. If you ever feel like catching up or grabbing a coffee, I'd love to hear from you. But regardless, I wish you nothing but happiness and fulfillment in all that you do. I pray for you and will continue to pray for your wellbeing &amp;amp; happiness.

He makes me so happy.</Title><Author>u/sheerest_of_folly</Author><Content>I know not many people will likely care to read my rant, but I love this man so fucking much.      We‚Äôve been dating for almost 3 years (anniversary in July). For 2.5 of them, we were online. Online relationships are hard. He‚Äôs in South Carolina, I was in Maryland.      I decided to move to him. On the way down, on January 31st, literally 40 minutes away, my mom fell asleep at the wheel and we crashed into the moving van (she was going to drop me off, as she herself was moving to Florida with my youngest sibling. Other sibling stayed with Dad in Maryland for college.)      I was the only one moderately injured in the wreck (thank God) and was taken to the hospital in an ambulance. I told my boyfriend where. He met me there. I saw my boyfriend in person for the first time while on a hospital bed.      The first few months were rough for me to settle in. 21 years in Maryland in the same area my whole life was hard to transition from. My boyfriend was with me every step of the way.      March was the anniversary of the deaths of several people who were important to me in my youth. They died in a car crash when I was a young teen. In Maryland, every year I would go to the playground we all played at on their deathiversary, since none of them were buried (all cremated to my knowledge). My boyfriend drove me the 500 miles to go back to Maryland to be at that playground.      In April, I had a breast reduction surgery. The recovery for that was rough‚Äî for the first two weeks, I couldn‚Äôt reach my middle well enough to use the bathroom. This man wiped my pee for me, and once the anesthesia wore off, my poop too. I got my period in the second week. He learned how to put a tampon in me and take it out. He was by my side the whole time.      The breast reduction was done in Maryland and we stayed with my father for a week. I‚Äôve only seen my father cry three times: when our cat died, at the end of Star Wars (because ‚Äúit‚Äôs so happy, they got the medals they worked so hard for‚Äù üíÄ), and when my boyfriend and I left. My father said he‚Äôs a good man and he‚Äôs so happy for us. He also gave him $400 to ‚Äúpay him back‚Äù for medical expenses. My boyfriend ended up using the remainder on a date with me.      Speaking of dates. I love notebooks and pens; my boyfriend doesn‚Äôt really care about those. Yet he took me on a date to Staples and Michaels, I thought to window shop but he bought so much for me. He also gets me some model skulls that I collect when he sees a cool one. Shortly after I moved in, he came home with one meant for an aquarium: ‚ÄúI thought of you.‚Äù I cried.      We went to MomoCon this year, and he cosplayed with me. We went as Leon and Ada from the Resident Evil series (specifically the RE4 remake). He waited in line for Digimon and Pok√©mon voice actors with me and listened to me rant about the characters I like.      We‚Äôre getting married next year. We aren‚Äôt conventionally engaged yet‚Äî he has something planned but won‚Äôt tell me‚Äî but we know we‚Äôre getting married. We just haven‚Äôt told our families yet.      I‚Äôm so fucking excited and happy that this is the man I get to spend my life with.</Content></post><post><Title>This is why it‚Äôs important to have a baby with the right man.</Title><Author>u/Taurussszn</Author><Content>I always tell my friends when you look at a man he should give you that feeling of ‚Äúugh I‚Äôd ruin my body to have a baby by this man‚Äù      &amp;amp; my man gave me those exact vibes. I couldn‚Äôt be any more proud the partner &amp;amp; soulmate I have.      We had an unplanned &amp;amp; first pregnancy last year. I never wanted kids but I‚Äôve always said if we was to have a baby I never want to work during my pregnancy and at least the first year of motherhood. He did just that respected my wishes. He took me out of my job provided for me throughout our pregnancy, allowed me to enjoy every aspect of it, attended ALL appointments included the ones that weren‚Äôt about the baby but about me.      That was the moment for me I knew I was having a baby with the right person. After I gave birth the first 6 weeks he didn‚Äôt leave by my side supported my throughout my breastfeeding journey (still doing) he cooked for me making sure I ate, made sure I got enough sleep, would take most nights with our newborn and some days too, made sure I didn‚Äôt feel overwhelmed.

Compared to all flings or real relationships (some more healthy/successful than others) I've had in the past it was the most authentic affection I've received so far. And the most I've wanted to give affection in return. I'm not particularly sad or regretful in any way cause I knew the conditions, but I'm startled that I can confidently say a less than two month fling felt more honest and caring than any previous entanglement had. I don't think it's because it is more fresh in my mind, just to state. I guess I just always felt like I did more or more was always expected from me than was ever given. I guess I'm wondering how it's possible that the most mature and earnest experience of positive emotional expression (non-platonic) I've had so far came from something so simple and short lived ?</Content></post><post><Title>Do you and your partner have anything that only you do?</Title><Author>u/PlumxGloriosa</Author><Content>Is there something that's "your thing"? something only you both do together, like it would hurt your conscience to do it with someone else?

The tears on your face as we said I love you for the last time are forever imprinted in my memory. You don't know how badly I wanted to wipe them away, kiss your forehead, and promise you it would be okay. I knew I couldn't, because then I would never get out of your car.      I've been trying to keep myself busy. Started going to the gym every day instead of every other. It hasn't really helped too much, but it's nice to keep my mind off you for a few hours. I stare at my bare ring finger more often than I should. I still instinctively go to grab my ring off my dresser when I wake up every morning, even though it's not there anymore.      Everything makes me think of you. The cicadas chirping makes me think of us laughing when you told me they keep getting caught in your windshield. The news reminds me of our long drives where we would discuss politics and everything going on in the world. Every outfit I put on reminds me of when I would wear it with you.      Inside Out 2 comes out in two days! I hope you're as excited as I am. I know we've been planning for months on watching it together on opening night. A part of me wonders if we'll be watching it at the same time at different theatres, laughing and crying at the same parts of it. Honestly, I'm probably just going to cry through this whole thing as I wish you were by my side while I watch. Maybe I'll wait to see it until I feel ready. I hope you still get to see it, though.      I can't stop living in the "what ifs" of it all. What could have been different, what could have changed. I yearn for you. My heart feels half empty. I know it's unhealthy to live in the past, but the only way I've been able to fall asleep at night is when I replay our old memories in our head. Even then, I wake up in the middle of the night gasping and imagining the past few days have just been some fucked up nightmare.      I had to mute your number, because every time my phone buzzed, deep down I hoped it was you. Even still, I find myself constantly looking at the little red numbers above the texting app, hoping it goes up by one. The amount of times I dialed your number just to not hit call is pathetic. I just need to hear your voice. I know this yearning is unhealthy, but I don't know when it will go away.      I miss your smile, and the way your nose scrunches when you're really happy. I miss your silky black hair and your mocha skin. I miss your dark brown eyes that I would constantly get lost in. I miss your touch and I miss your kisses. I miss feeling the tightness when you squeeze me when we hug. I miss hearing your heart beat when I rest my head on your chest. I remember the first time I ever did that way back when we first staring dating and I could feel it racing, it made me blush. I miss your gentle voice and your roaring laugh. I miss our deep talks and our petty gossip. I even miss our fights, as dumb as that sounds. I just miss everything.      It's been hard to scroll through social media because anytime I see something that reminds me of you, I want to send it to you. I've been sending them to my own number instead. In fact, to be honest, I've been texting my own number a lot. Whenever I want to text you, I just text it to myself. It still cuts like glass when the message immediately bounces back.      Anyway, my eyes are getting misty so I'll stop here. Goodbye, my love. Maybe in another life, we'll do things right. I love you infinity plus one, ha I win.</Content></post><post><Title>I always wondered if love was for me but turns out it is</Title><Author>u/savemefromgod101</Author><Content>I cannot be more happier.

We've been through so many "final closure" conversations but it never helps as much as I want it to.

My partner knows this and we are in a QPR. I'm here because I want to know how people experience love and what it feels like. How they know they're in love. What it is.      I'm a little confused. I understand friendship love. I understand familial. But I don't understand romantic.      A lot of it is just personal. I don't understand PDA or why people feel the urge to post it online. It's everywhere and there seems to be something about it I'm not grasping. I don't understand people who make their partner responsible for everything that goes about them. They're they're own person too. I feel like that would be too much pressure on someone. I don't understand "romantic expectations" like sex or how your life goal according to society should be to get in a romantic relationship. I don't understand so much about "love" or affection, at least now how society views it, and I want to understand.      I have a partner and I care about them very much. I feel about them differently than I do other people. I'd be okay sharing a life with them and doing things together. But, I don't feel that strong desire for certain romantic things. I love sending them gifts, calling them, and doing things together. I love being there for them and comforting them. I'm always proud of them.      But it feels like my love differs from romantic or what's seen around me. I'd like to understand.      I understand strong care. I understand wanting to give your life to protect someone. I understand wanting to keep someone safe. I understand letting someone go if they'd be happier. I understand the concepts but can't seem to relate to romantic love at all, no matter how much I try.</Content></post><post><Title>I am in total awe of him and it‚Äôs written all over my face.</Title><Author>u/Scrapiee</Author><Content>No content</Content></post><post><Title>you ever have that moment that makes you think to yourself you're really in love with them?</Title><Author>u/togayther</Author><Content>for me, it happened today. we're in a fairly new relationship (2 mo) although we've spent a lot of months as friends previously. i'm currently on longer vacation than usual (out of the country) and in a situation where i'm unable to even really text often/call. the timezones also make it tough to communicate. on the rare chance i get service, my partner would send me a couple of very sweet voice messages every few days to listen to when i got service and make sure we spend so much time together. my s/o told me today they'd been looking at pictures of me and i got them saying to me "i don't care what you say, you look so pretty even without makeup" and it just made me feel so loved. my partner just puts in all these little things that make my love for them go insane. the effort goes a long way and even their words that make me feel the most intense of emotions. üíó</Content></post><post><Title>Does anyone have any little gift ideas for a boyfriend?</Title><Author>u/Adri_72</Author><Content>So, me and my boyfriend have been together for a little over 2 years and summer sucks cause we can't see each other, and we're both busy all the time.

She told me she‚Äôd done some research online and wanted to go to Rigby &amp;amp; Peller at Bluewater shopping center in Kent.      We drove there that evening, and I left her for half an hour to have a fitting appointment.      I left her with my credit card and wandered around the shops for a while. I came back and waited outside the shop for her once it‚Äôd been about 25 minutes.      She came out with the bra packaged inside a cord-handled bag. She was beaming with excitement. We sat down briefly and she showed me how they‚Äôd carefully wrapped it in tissue paper for her.      As we drove home I just remember her telling me how comfortable it was when she tried it on , how the sales assistant had made her feel positive about it, and how special it made her feel. She told me the same thing a few times but I loved every moment of it.      She‚Äôd never had a properly fitted bra before and it‚Äôs an experience that I think I enjoyed more just listening to how happy it made her ü•π</Content></post><post><Title>Love is complicated, but I don't think I would have it any other way.</Title><Author>u/Either_Title645</Author><Content>So this is going to be a story of quick sudden love, heart ache, friendship, and thoughts on what the future may bring.      I've gone back and forth on if I should tell this story, but I'm a writer at heart and putting thoughts and emotions to words is how I work through it all, and maybe someone will read this and feel something, also so all the kids out there know that love is never simple, and you are bound to get caught up in it even well into your adult years.      So back in January I met lets call her N, and we instantly connected. Like she called me the night after our coffee date to talk more, it was just so comfortable, we texted every day, called few times a week. Within a couple weeks we'd been on three more dates and made things official, after that we spent every weekend either at her place or mine, and occasionally got together during the week too. N and I have a dozen things in common, specific video games, humor, movies, and even our obscure fashion and interior design choices match. We shared personal, private pains.      Before two months were up she had told me she loved me, I'd told her I was getting there, I had met her friends more than once, and we both had told our parents about each other. It seemed like a beautiful beginning. But then it ended suddenly. She had a bout of insecurities and she felt like she didn't deserve me, I couldn't convince her I was happy with her, and she ended things. But neither of us wanted the other out of our lives.      We continued to talk every day, call each other, and we still regularly got together in person. After more than a month it looked from my side like we could start again, but N had an old long distance friend. This guy had never been too happy we were dating, and had decided now was a good time to come down and see N for the first time in years. I had an opportunity to tell N how I truly felt before he showed up, N and I had gone out drinking the night before he arrived, and though she showed doubt about what she wanted from her old friend, there was wonder too. So rather than throw an emotional bomb at her the night before, I kept my silence.      I told her a week later, though I knew she had decided to be with him. I told her, not to confuse or ask anything of her, simply because she deserved to know. Her old insecurities had been wrong, and I still wanted to be a part of her life. She was not happy. Mad that I had taken so long to feel what she had felt months earlier, mad that I hadn't said anything that last night, mad that she thought I was only pretending to be friends, and even still insecure that I could still want someone like her in my life.      That was only a month ago, and to this day we talk everyday, call at least once a week, and see each other nearly every week. We are both excited for an upcoming con, a game release later this year, and she expressed wanting to go to renn faire with me still. She is fast becoming my best friend, and I honestly am so happy I met her, I don't regret a thing.      I don't know what the future holds, I'm casually looking for another partner, but mainly on bettering myself. We may or may not ever get back together, but I hope that in five years we are still talking every day, and getting together once a week to see each other. Love is beautiful in all forms, even at times in heartbreak and lost potential.</Content></post><post><Title>I am so excited to marry my person one day soon.</Title><Author>u/strawberryyogurt_</Author><Content>My boyfriend and I have dealt with some pretty rough life stuff together, and in the end working through everything and figuring life out together makes us grow stronger. I feel so connected to him, and I love him with my entire being. He's my person. The one I want to do everything with, the first person I tell about anything. The person I turn to for comfort, for laughter.      I love exploring our city together just as much as I love exploring new places together. I love the small things just as much as I love the big things. His smile makes my heart melt and I've never been more interested in what anyone has to say than when he's talking about something he's passionate about. I feel so safe in his presence and I sleep better with him than I ever have.      We've been talking about getting married for the past couple months and he's confirmed that he plans on getting me an engagement ring soon, and with our anniversary coming up at the end of the month I feel like it'll be around then. Plus, I saw him looking up rings. And I'm so excited. Whether he does it now or later, I'm just happy to know I'll be spending the rest of my life with him. I don't care about a big wedding or anything like that. I just can't wait to call him my husband, and to hear him call me his wife.      Love, in all forms, is what makes life truly worth living. Connection, and shared experiences. Self love. The love of being a parent, or being a child. Closeness with your family, or building your own chosen family. Friendships, marriages, and pets. This is what it's about. And I'm eternally grateful to be filled with an infinite amount of love, and especially grateful to feel it back. ‚ù§Ô∏è</Content></post><post><Title>I told my best friend I liked her, then this happened.

We are incompatible and yet we liked spending time together. He loves me but I am still finding my understanding of love in him. I don‚Äôt find peace. I feel hurt and misunderstood.      We‚Äôve been tumultuous for long and I think now, I don‚Äôt have it in me to resist a breakup more. I feel no emotion but a very heavy heart. Almost as if I am tired to feel the sadness.

A love like this can‚Äôt be real right?</Title><Author>u/kaiwolf26</Author><Content>I don‚Äôt know where to start and how to even begin quantifying my feelings into words for finding a girl beyond my dreams. I‚Äôve been seeing her for almost a year and I‚Äôm still anticipating someone popping out with a camera crew to let me know it‚Äôs all been a set up, but it never happens.      I tried dating apps and asking people out for the better part of a decade not really feeling much of a connection or finding a spark that fizzled out quickly.      In the last couple years I realized I was asexual. The general population is less than 1% ace, and of that one percent you‚Äôre lucky if you find 1 or 2 people you have something in common with.      When I saw her dating profile I was floored. Someone who was more like me than anyone I‚Äôd ever seen on any dating app, ace, and incredibly beautiful.      We hit it off pretty quickly through text chat and quickly moved to phone calls. We have similar niche hobbies, asthetics, work in the same industry, similar off brand humor, politics, values, and so many more things.      She‚Äôs hilarious, nerdy, an incredible artist talented beyond her years, jaw dropping beautiful, smart, affectionate and caring.      I have so many overwhelming feelings about her and our time together so far, like on our first date when she held my arm as we drunkenly walked the city streets looking at an festival market and playing ski ball together at the arcade, or our second date having a picnic in the botanical gardens, looking at all the Christmas lights in town til dark and doing star gazing. It‚Äôs been almost a year of dating and every one we go one seems impossibly magical  putting rom coms to shame.      We spend a few evenings each week playing board games online, cracking jokes and telling each other about what‚Äôs going on in our lives. It‚Äôs been like finding a new best friend who I can also cuddle and shower with admiration.      I‚Äôm mostly writing this because I can‚Äôt see her immediately and need to vent all this loving energy somewhere. I can‚Äôt wait til I get to see her again, sharing time with her just makes that time so much brighter!</Content></post><post><Title>Happy birthday baby lee üëª please come back.

We had mutuals so we would come around each other when our friends had kickbacks etc. I began to pursue him because I thought he was cute and liked him. Eventually he showed me that he reciprocated so we began to date and go out. We would go to sports games out to dinners &amp;amp; he would come over often to swim etc.  we had a real strong connection and all- This all happened so fast, but we were young and in love. even though I wanted him to make me his girlfriend he never did because he didn't know that I wanted that.      Eventually I got back with my ex &amp;amp; we decided to stay as "friends". Obviously the relationship with my ex didn't work out and we ended up breaking up indefinitely. I continued to live my life, but I couldn't help but not being able to stop thinking about the one that got away. It has been years since we've talked and yet I feel like this- wondering what if?  One night while drinking with my friends I got the balls to reach out to him (the one who got away). I tried to rekindle our relationship and at first he was for it. He was a bit hesitant and still had a wall up which was understandable, but gradually he was letting me in. We decided we were going to take it slow and we were not girlfriend and boyfriend yet, but I was happy and content with how it was going. I was growing as a person in different aspects of my life and wanted him to be apart of it all.      Sometime later that month I went hiking with my best friend that I call Main Squeeze, babe, bae all of the above (she‚Äôs been my bestie since middle school). We were making it a habit of going hiking every weekend. One Saturday when we went hiking, I posted on Twitter "going hiking with bae" &amp;amp; he saw it and immediately unfollowed me and ghosted me. l know from his perspective it seemed wrong, but I was seriously hiking with my best friend. Looking back now obvi that was stupid to do but I was young and dumb. Me being young, dumb and immature, I didn't think to reach out to him and I just let it be.      I was being stubborn that he unfollowed me and left it as is. I never got to explain myself or tell him that it was only my best friend I was hiking with. Here I am 8 years later still thinking of him and now he was the one that got away. I keep thinking of where life could've taken us &amp;amp; how happy we could've been. It makes me sad because I want him to see the person that I am today, (grown with an education, car own place etc), I still have things I can work on &amp;amp; those are all materialistic things but I have worked so hard for the person I am today. I‚Äôm so proud of the woman I am today and wish he could be apart of this chapter of my life.      Maybe a year or two after that incident I reached out to him through text. At that time he was in a relationship so he just responded with " maybe you shouldn't be texting me lol" I said OK and left it as is. Fast forward to today they are no longer together, that relationship did not last long and as far as I know he is single. I brought this up to my therapist and she encouraged me to maybe reach out now to just express my feelings and where I'm at right now, to do it now while we're single and not committed to anything. She said that might be easier because time will pass and if I wait for more time for us to be in committed relationships or even married with a family to then even think about reaching out will be difficult. So should I do it? Should I reach out? I don't want to be a bother. I don't want to be a fool or make a fool of myself. Should I just let it be and continue to live my life how l've been? It has been years since we've talked and yet I feel like this wondering what if?</Content></post><post><Title>Why do I get played even though I show them affection like this?</Title><Author>u/lmaowhy0101</Author><Content>My love, someday I'll find you.

I was over that person and I was ready the date. But the funny thing was, I decided to hop on PlayStation with my two friends wanting to play a video game to just pass the time since at the time I was living with my parents and I was waiting to go to work because at the time I didn‚Äôt have my license. so we played a game of Fortnite and rocket league and I think we did fall guys.      But then I was talking to one of my friends and I said dude this whole. PlayStation list of people on here is very bare meaning I don‚Äôt have any person. I only had like my family and a few coworkers on there. And my friends from school when I graduated. I said to my friend I wish there was a way that I can find people and be friends with and just play video games because at the time I was still in a dark place I needed somebody to talk to like my friends didn‚Äôt really talk to me about that stuff because sometimes they would get annoyed      And would not talk to them about it. So I hopped on Reddit. I had an old account where I went on the sub, but I had to delete it because of stuff happened, which explain another time but I went on there scrolled a few to see if anybody was willing to play a video game. I met one person. they were from the states like I was we didn‚Äôt really play any games. We just talked on discord that was really about it. We were talking for about a few weeks and they were likely busy a lot so we didn‚Äôt really get much talking to and I didn‚Äôt really get to play with them on video games so I was a little bummed out about that so I scrolled again on that sub Reddit to look then I found the post that would change my life like seriously she made a post about wanting to find people to play video games. There was a few people on that. That asked her to play video games.      They gave their usernames to her and I was one of the few that gave her mine because I said hey I‚Äôm a girl if that matters. After a bit, I hopped on PlayStation and played with my friends, and I got a notification. Saying the infamous line hey are you from Reddit? And I said yes I‚Äôm from Reddit. Are you that person that made that post and obviously I was thinking oh my God I‚Äôm so stupid. Yes of course that is.      We started talking for a bit. She asked me are you from the UK and I said I‚Äôm actually from the United States we started talking a little bit and we didn‚Äôt play any games at first she actually ghosted me for a bit lol and after that she came back and we started playing a video games together, and she asked me if I had discord and I gave her my username to her so after that, we actually started talking a lot more and we actually had so much in common we played video games and after a while we actually started having feelings for each other when we were talking about this not long ago she said she was the first person to fall in love with me even though I was like wait really I was shocked because I was the first person that fell in love with her so now the rest is history it‚Äôs been going on for almost 2 years now me and her together in December.      Thank you so much for reading this and I hope you find your person ‚ù§Ô∏è also sorry about the grammar.

Next day I text her telling her I want to see her again and she told me she was thinking the exact same.ever since She always makes compliments about me( she told me at our first date that I was the most beautiful guy she has kissed), she is protecting, she takes cares of me, she cooks for me or washes the dishes when I return tired from the gym or work, she never complains or makes me feel jealous. We have the best sex together, she doesn‚Äôt bother giving me head for hours even tho I don‚Äôt ask her. I‚Äôm so opened to her emotionally and she never took use of that. She protects me so much I feel like this is not even real. She shows how much she wants to see me and actually does stuff to achieve that. She introduced me to her parents and friends too. I could keep on going for hours‚Ä¶.after a 2 years relationship with a girl that was physically and mentally abusing me I feel like I‚Äôm in paradise.

My girlfriend and I have been going through my out for 2 1/2-3 months or so, and yesterday she told me she thinks she loves me.      I knew ahead of time I wasn‚Äôt going to say it until we were further into the relationship as I‚Äôve gotten out of a 13 year marriage and want to be careful because she‚Äôs my first relationship post divorce. I do feel those feelings, I want to spend every day with her and when she leaves I‚Äôm very sad.      The thing that‚Äôs made this relationship feel different is I am a different man than the one who was married for 13 years. It was a high school sweetheart relationship and we both had our failings but for my part I wasn‚Äôt emotionally mature enough to be the husband and loving partner I needed to be. I‚Äôve made those changes with my new girlfriend and it‚Äôs been appreciated and shown. She makes me know I have changed into who I‚Äôve wanted to be and appreciates when I‚Äôm trying in a way my ex just didn‚Äôt.      We‚Äôve also gone through some emotionally heavy times with my divorce obviously looming over our relationship and the grieving process for me that entails as well as her having lost her father this past week after a years long fight with cancer.      I have been there for her in the way I always knew I could but never did with my ex wife. I‚Äôve been supportive, I met her father on his deathbed, drove up the day after to support her. And we were lying in bed and she let out all of her emotions over his passing (she‚Äôd been handling it weirdly well in the days after until that moment). I held her while she cried as much as she needed and then she said she wanted to say something but was nervous.      I had a feeling I knew what she was going to say but I tried to give her the space to because it felt like she really wanted to. And then she said it.      ‚ÄúI think I love you‚Äù      It made me flutter, it felt like every effort I‚Äôve made on myself to be a better man to be a better partner were recognized by someone I enjoy so much and can see a future with.      I responded with what I felt was the most heartfelt way while explaining where I was at.      ‚ÄúI‚Äôm getting closer every day.‚Äù      It‚Äôs an accurate description that I am getting to that point to say it back, that I‚Äôm building an emotional connection, I just can‚Äôt say it this close to when my marriage dissolved. But also I want her to know it‚Äôs not that I won‚Äôt be or that I‚Äôm emotionally unavailable.      And to her absolute credit she said she didn‚Äôt need to hear it back, just that she needed to say it because she‚Äôs felt it since the day after I met her father.      So I just want to be certain I handled this right, that I responded in the right way to say exactly how I feel: I will be there someday soon just not yet.</Content></post><post><Title>Idk who needs to hear this, but the partner your having a hard time understand and getting along with.

I loved her since the first month but she had a boyfriend. We talked about our problems, I cared about her and she cared about me and we still do, never been so in love with someone in my life, can't express how perfect she is. Thing is, I don't think she is as happy as she'd like to be in her relationship, and I never expressed my real feelings to her because I'm afraid of breaking my relation with her. This has got to a point where I think I won't fall in love with anyone else because I won't find anyone like her, lately I just can't stop thinking about it, everything reminds me of her.

I'm 27F and never been in love before, so I've no baseline for how it's supposed to feel. I tried researching it and one of the most common answers was "you just know" followed by "if you have to ask, you're not" but I'm not sure that'll be true for me as I'm a bit disconnected from my emotions.      For instance, with my friends, they're great people, I love being around them and I want the best for them, but do I love them? I don't know. I can confidently say I love my best friend, but that's because I've known her 13 years. And I never had a "wow, I love this girl" revelation with her either. I only knew years down the line when I realised we'd built something permanent and substantial and we knew each other inside and out. It's the same with my family - I know I love them because they've been in my life for so long. I can't picture life without them. So I'd say love to me = familiarity and comfort.      Is romantic love different? Less about the practicalities? I just don't understand. I like this guy a lot. I'm attracted to him physically but also emotionally. I'm a very shy person, I struggle with social anxiety, but when I'm with him I never worry about being judged or saying the wrong thing. I just feel completely at ease, like I can totally be myself. I've never been around him and thought "man, I wish this would end." We always have fun together. I care about him and want to impress him, he's the first thing on my mind in the mornings and the last thing on my mind at night.      Is this what love is supposed to be? I've never looked at him and had a magical revelation. I don't know if it'll last. But I know I want to keep showing up for him, and I hope he wants that too.</Content></post><post><Title>Does anyone else love being called sweetie, honey, dear, baby, etc.?</Title><Author>u/MoonyDropps</Author><Content>ok ok maybe I'm just lonely üò≠ but like, both in platonic and especially romantic contexts I love being called cutesy nicknames. but when I talk to other girls my age they don't really seem to like them, so I feel a bit odd.      for example, a couple weeks ago, my one guy friend told me, "thank you, darlin'" after I signed his yearbook, and I was just like ü´† and so happy on the inside. its so pathetic lmao</Content></post><post><Title>Hi everyone!

He made sure we video call much as he can, we played games and watch YouTube together most nights.      10 months later he asked me to go to a $b concert. He already had a ticket but since the show was sold out he was looking around for one from around town for mine . I got the time off and flew over. He waited at the gate with some flowers for me. But he wasn‚Äôt able to get another ticket, so he sold his ticket. Even though  he was so excited and the reason he asked me to come fell through he wasn‚Äôt t upset, he was just happy I was there we just blasted it at home instead. my medication alerts changed because of the time difference and he woke up at 5am every morning to help me take my meds, I didn‚Äôt even ask. He had a month off work so he took me somewhere new every day. I met his whole family and they welcomed me immediately. And his friends are my friends now too! His mom picked me up when he was he went back to work, so I wasn‚Äôt home alone during the day all week. His mom told me she‚Äôs  never seen him this happyü•π      I have bpd, and I was still struggling when we first met.

I don't even think that we should end up together at this point. But I just can't stop loving him. I feel like I am depressed deep down because of this. I'm always tired and want to sleep.  If I try to do something for my own good, I get intrusive thoughts that I'm doing it for him rather than me. Idk what I am supposed to do. I just wanna stop loving him. But I can't cause I just feel so much love even if I hear someone taking his name.

I feel like that this is more of a wedding vow or an engagement line, that requires at least a committed year together with all the highs and lows.      The thing is, and this is something that I've observed, is that when a man is genuinely committed to their partner, he will move mountains, he will part seas for them, he will bring the sky down, if that's what it takes. People sing for love, live for love, kill for love, and die for love. And that's so true. You will literally start wars and make peace for love.      I don't know, I probably should start actually dating someone. It's just hard being vulnerable, and it's really not something that I need to worry about right now, because of my other priorities. It would be nice, to be with someone. But I don't want to be with someone just to be with someone, I want it to be because I'm truly, madly, deeply, completely in love with them.      That is the way. And my more Mandalorian side is showing now. Because they have to be your cyare.      It's actually a little funny because, at least for me, love is deep, ocean deep to the hadosphere. It can be as beautiful as a sunfish, or as monstrous as an anglerfish. It depends on the day, and it depends on the people involved, and of course, the reciprocity. There's one thing I've learned though, you should never sacrifice your self-respect. That if somebody genuinely loves you, they will value your self-respect and your agency too much to allow you to burn it.      Went from a question to an early morning philosophy rant. Sorry about that and have a great weekend.</Content></post><post><Title>Is the guy emotionally attached to me? He seems to need frequent attention</Title><Author>u/Dazzling_Ant_6881</Author><Content>My guy friend messages me and request to call when something upsetting at work happened to him. So, we ended up having a therapy talk where we are trying to figure out how to fix his work issues. Then, out of the blue I suddenly had issues myself and I had problems with my health so I told him, he ended up fussing about it and sharing a lot of tips and basically was very caring about it.      I really appreciated it but at the same time I noticed our conversations are becoming continuous throughout the day or maybe we just had a hard time but I find that when he has problems, he automatically calls me first which in turn lead me to reciprocate.      He also messaged me about my facebook post commenting how lively I was and energetic on my post. I find his messages cute and sweet. It was the first time he commented about something I posted but he does seem to always check on me especially whenever I deactivate or reactivate in the past. In the past, when i deactivate, he really tries to message me through other means and when I reactivate, he welcomes me back.      He also constantly ask about me often even if he is the one who got hospitalized and got major surgery. I don't know if we're getting too attached here or what's going on but we do seem to have shared problems and frequently update each other.      I try to not contact as often as possible but he often initiates asking how i am first and tells me everything that is going on with him with photos and everything else. He does seem to also want to emotionally care and support me to which I'm drawn to his caring side.</Content></post><post><Title>How do I recover from being ghosted early on in the relationship?</Title><Author>u/AdministrativeLynx83</Author><Content>Hi everyone.

Instead of leaving me on delivered for 19 hours on a day we planned to hang out. I thought I was being as respectful and communicative as possible, but he hasn‚Äôt talked to me since.

Do you want to talk?‚Äù I know it‚Äôs over since he hasn‚Äôt talked to me since and we have talked everyday since we first met, but also that it‚Äôs probably not healthy to be in a relationship with someone that can‚Äôt communicate anyway.

She makes me know I have changed into who I‚Äôve wanted to be and appreciates when I‚Äôm trying in a way my ex just didn‚Äôt.      We‚Äôve also gone through some emotionally heavy times with my divorce obviously looming over our relationship and the grieving process for me that entails as well as her having lost her father this past week after a years long fight with cancer.      I have been there for her in the way I always knew I could but never did with my ex wife. I‚Äôve been supportive, I met her father on his deathbed, drove up the day after to support her. And we were lying in bed and she let out all of her emotions over his passing (she‚Äôd been handling it weirdly well in the days after until that moment). I held her while she cried as much as she needed and then she said she wanted to say something but was nervous.      I had a feeling I knew what she was going to say but I tried to give her the space to because it felt like she really wanted to. And then she said it.      ‚ÄúI think I love you‚Äù      It made me flutter, it felt like every effort I‚Äôve made on myself to be a better man to be a better partner were recognized by someone I enjoy so much and can see a future with.      I responded with what I felt was the most heartfelt way while explaining where I was at.      ‚ÄúI‚Äôm getting closer every day.‚Äù      It‚Äôs an accurate description that I am getting to that point to say it back, that I‚Äôm building an emotional connection, I just can‚Äôt say it this close to when my marriage dissolved. But also I want her to know it‚Äôs not that I won‚Äôt be or that I‚Äôm emotionally unavailable.      And to her absolute credit she said she didn‚Äôt need to hear it back, just that she needed to say it because she‚Äôs felt it since the day after I met her father.      So I just want to be certain I handled this right, that I responded in the right way to say exactly how I feel: I will be there someday soon just not yet.</Content></post><post><Title>Idk who needs to hear this, but the partner your having a hard time understand and getting along with.

I loved her since the first month but she had a boyfriend. We talked about our problems, I cared about her and she cared about me and we still do, never been so in love with someone in my life, can't express how perfect she is. Thing is, I don't think she is as happy as she'd like to be in her relationship, and I never expressed my real feelings to her because I'm afraid of breaking my relation with her. This has got to a point where I think I won't fall in love with anyone else because I won't find anyone like her, lately I just can't stop thinking about it, everything reminds me of her.

I'm 27F and never been in love before, so I've no baseline for how it's supposed to feel. I tried researching it and one of the most common answers was "you just know" followed by "if you have to ask, you're not" but I'm not sure that'll be true for me as I'm a bit disconnected from my emotions.      For instance, with my friends, they're great people, I love being around them and I want the best for them, but do I love them? I don't know. I can confidently say I love my best friend, but that's because I've known her 13 years. And I never had a "wow, I love this girl" revelation with her either. I only knew years down the line when I realised we'd built something permanent and substantial and we knew each other inside and out. It's the same with my family - I know I love them because they've been in my life for so long. I can't picture life without them. So I'd say love to me = familiarity and comfort.      Is romantic love different? Less about the practicalities? I just don't understand. I like this guy a lot. I'm attracted to him physically but also emotionally. I'm a very shy person, I struggle with social anxiety, but when I'm with him I never worry about being judged or saying the wrong thing. I just feel completely at ease, like I can totally be myself. I've never been around him and thought "man, I wish this would end." We always have fun together. I care about him and want to impress him, he's the first thing on my mind in the mornings and the last thing on my mind at night.      Is this what love is supposed to be? I've never looked at him and had a magical revelation. I don't know if it'll last. But I know I want to keep showing up for him, and I hope he wants that too.</Content></post><post><Title>Does anyone else love being called sweetie, honey, dear, baby, etc.?</Title><Author>u/MoonyDropps</Author><Content>ok ok maybe I'm just lonely üò≠ but like, both in platonic and especially romantic contexts I love being called cutesy nicknames. but when I talk to other girls my age they don't really seem to like them, so I feel a bit odd.      for example, a couple weeks ago, my one guy friend told me, "thank you, darlin'" after I signed his yearbook, and I was just like ü´† and so happy on the inside. its so pathetic lmao</Content></post><post><Title>Hi everyone!

He made sure we video call much as he can, we played games and watch YouTube together most nights.      10 months later he asked me to go to a $b concert. He already had a ticket but since the show was sold out he was looking around for one from around town for mine . I got the time off and flew over. He waited at the gate with some flowers for me. But he wasn‚Äôt able to get another ticket, so he sold his ticket. Even though  he was so excited and the reason he asked me to come fell through he wasn‚Äôt t upset, he was just happy I was there we just blasted it at home instead. my medication alerts changed because of the time difference and he woke up at 5am every morning to help me take my meds, I didn‚Äôt even ask. He had a month off work so he took me somewhere new every day. I met his whole family and they welcomed me immediately. And his friends are my friends now too!

We never got into a relationship but we were close friends. He was in another relationship and it broke me but I continued to stay friends. I don't talk to the person anymore but I think I'm still in love with him. I have been trying to move on since a few months now. I have accepted that we won't ever be together. I don't even think that we should end up together at this point. But I just can't stop loving him. I feel like I am depressed deep down because of this. I'm always tired and want to sleep.  If I try to do something for my own good, I get intrusive thoughts that I'm doing it for him rather than me. Idk what I am supposed to do. I just wanna stop loving him. But I can't cause I just feel so much love even if I hear someone taking his name. I would really like to grow in life, but I feel I'm extremely limited by the fact that I love him but he won't ever do that.

I feel like that this is more of a wedding vow or an engagement line, that requires at least a committed year together with all the highs and lows.      The thing is, and this is something that I've observed, is that when a man is genuinely committed to their partner, he will move mountains, he will part seas for them, he will bring the sky down, if that's what it takes. People sing for love, live for love, kill for love, and die for love. And that's so true. You will literally start wars and make peace for love.      I don't know, I probably should start actually dating someone. It's just hard being vulnerable, and it's really not something that I need to worry about right now, because of my other priorities. It would be nice, to be with someone. But I don't want to be with someone just to be with someone, I want it to be because I'm truly, madly, deeply, completely in love with them.      That is the way. And my more Mandalorian side is showing now. Because they have to be your cyare.      It's actually a little funny because, at least for me, love is deep, ocean deep to the hadosphere. It can be as beautiful as a sunfish, or as monstrous as an anglerfish. It depends on the day, and it depends on the people involved, and of course, the reciprocity. There's one thing I've learned though, you should never sacrifice your self-respect. That if somebody genuinely loves you, they will value your self-respect and your agency too much to allow you to burn it.      Went from a question to an early morning philosophy rant. Sorry about that and have a great weekend.</Content></post><post><Title>Is the guy emotionally attached to me? He seems to need frequent attention</Title><Author>u/Dazzling_Ant_6881</Author><Content>My guy friend messages me and request to call when something upsetting at work happened to him. So, we ended up having a therapy talk where we are trying to figure out how to fix his work issues. Then, out of the blue I suddenly had issues myself and I had problems with my health so I told him, he ended up fussing about it and sharing a lot of tips and basically was very caring about it.      I really appreciated it but at the same time I noticed our conversations are becoming continuous throughout the day or maybe we just had a hard time but I find that when he has problems, he automatically calls me first which in turn lead me to reciprocate.      He also messaged me about my facebook post commenting how lively I was and energetic on my post. I find his messages cute and sweet. It was the first time he commented about something I posted but he does seem to always check on me especially whenever I deactivate or reactivate in the past. In the past, when i deactivate, he really tries to message me through other means and when I reactivate, he welcomes me back.      He also constantly ask about me often even if he is the one who got hospitalized and got major surgery. I don't know if we're getting too attached here or what's going on but we do seem to have shared problems and frequently update each other.      I try to not contact as often as possible but he often initiates asking how i am first and tells me everything that is going on with him with photos and everything else. He does seem to also want to emotionally care and support me to which I'm drawn to his caring side.</Content></post><post><Title>How do I recover from being ghosted early on in the relationship?</Title><Author>u/AdministrativeLynx83</Author><Content>Hi everyone. I 21f had been dating a guy for about 3 months until he ghosted me on Wednesday after I let him know I was upset that he left me on delivered all day bc he slept in till 7pm when we had made plans to see one another. I respectfully let him know that it upset me, I understand he works a lot, and in the future I just ask that he would just give me a heads up if he was too tired to meet, so I could anticipate that we won‚Äôt meet. Instead of leaving me on delivered for 19 hours on a day we planned to hang out. I thought I was being as respectful and communicative as possible, but he hasn‚Äôt talked to me since. I even sent a follow up text yesterday night saying ‚Äúhey did I say something that bothered you? If I did, that was not my intention and I just wanted to let you know how I felt in that moment. Do you want to talk?‚Äù I know it‚Äôs over since he hasn‚Äôt talked to me since and we have talked everyday since we first met, but also that it‚Äôs probably not healthy to be in a relationship with someone that can‚Äôt communicate anyway. I do feel really upset and sad because he was the first person I ever went on a date with and my first kiss. Any advice on how to heal from being hurt and basically ghosted?

I‚Äôve known one since kindergarten and the other two since 6th grade. We‚Äôve all remained pretty close and have taken some hard hits together.      In middle school, each year we had different ‚Äòfriends‚Äô that caused problems, mainly the impacts of their mental health affecting us. Then the other person who was in our group moved halfway across the country and then after a year or so, they stopped talking to us.      In high school, we had a normal first semester of freshman year, then the pandemic hit. We went back sophomore year with all the masks, bleaching desks after each class, plexiglass dividers at lunch tables, you know the works.      But on November 11th, I became paralyzed by a benign spinal tumor. The back pain I had leading up to it was excruciating, evidently it was a little tumor the size of the tip of my pinky finger destroying my spine from within. It completely destroyed my T2 vertebra, resulting in a full corpectomy, damaging T1-T4. I am a T4 incomplete paraplegic. This means I have no voluntary movement but some sensation. I can feel pressure and pain, but not temperature.      I spent 2 months in the hospital (complications) and 2 months in rehab, all during the pandemic. This included turning 16 in quarantine as a staff member tested positive for covid. As a birthday gift, my friends got me a build a bear raccoon named Raccoon Reacts, an inside joke.      Before the paralysis, I had a group of friends i‚Äôve been referring to as ‚Äòthe guys‚Äô since I was the only girl (no romantic feelings, they were like brothers to me.) I met them freshman year through shared classes and we‚Äôd discord call almost daily. Those calls helped me get through the hospital and rehab. My first outing after paralysis was a movie with them. I‚Äôd invite them over to hang out.      I went back to school that fall, junior year. My counselor was able to make my lunch time the same as theirs so i‚Äôd have friends to sit with. After lunch, they‚Äôd come with me in the elevator, even if their class wasn‚Äôt upstairs.      Throughout junior year, I started to notice that I stopped getting invited to things. I don‚Äôt know if they thought it would hurt more to be invited but not able to go due to inaccessibility of people‚Äôs houses, but I would‚Äôve preferred being invited anyway, that would mean they wanted me there, even if I couldn‚Äôt be. Speaking to a mutual, he said he noticed it too but didn‚Äôt say anything since we weren‚Äôt that close.      Senior year, they stopped responding to messages. I would see them in the halls and would wave or smile at them and some would do the same. One of them kept his eyes forward. I‚Äôm not hard to miss and he was tall.      I still have all of their birthdays on my calendar.      I lost my ex best friend and ex boyfriend the same month, ending friendship after a fight and getting dumped.      I felt so alone for so long. But my best friends helped pick up the pieces, offering support and love. We hadn‚Äôt been talking a ton when the problems w the guys happened, but one day I reached out, missing them, and it was like we never lost contact.      It was back to sending memes to each other, talking about our day, etc.      They‚Äôve been so supportive when things have gone wrong for me, and I‚Äôve been supportive the same.      Now that we‚Äôre on summer break for some (I graduated with a one year diploma in pharmacy technician at a community college), it‚Äôs just working around work schedules to hang out.      We‚Äôve gone to the zoo, saw movies, now we‚Äôre planning a puppy play date with our dogs.      They‚Äôve been with me since day one and I don‚Äôt know what I would do without them.

Yes, but I think the way we are handling it will set us up better for anything in the future)      To try to keep it short: my ex (28M) and I (26F) met in college and I knew immediately he was who I wanted to be with, he was cute, funny, kind, absolutely lit up every room he was in and he just genuinely made me so happy - fast forward to now (6.5 years later), we had been dating that whole time and went straight from college, to our first apartment, to buying a house and adopting 2 dogs but never spent any part of adult life alone. We both came into the relationship with a bit of a hole left from past relationships that we both filled for eachother but it left us with a major codependency issue that neither of us really noticed until now. Also since we bought our house 4 years ago, it basically was falling apart and needed expensive repairs often, we both had issues with work and very opposite schedules, and basically everything in our lives wasn‚Äôt working except our relationship but even that was strained by all of these outside factors.      He recently came to me and said he thinks he needs some time on his own to work on himself because he has been feeling depressed and that he doesn‚Äôt like himself or really know who he is as an individual and that he felt like I was the only thing making him happy and helping him through everything and it worked for a long time but he needed to be able to work on all of this stuff for himself alone. This was a blindside for me because he didn‚Äôt communicate any of this to me earlier (an issue he said he regrets and needs to work on in therapy) but I just want him to be happy and healthy and I want him to have the time to heal those things, and I also have realized my codependency I‚Äôve developed through all of the shit we went through too.      TLDR: it‚Äôs hard to sum up almost 7 years in a ‚Äúshort‚Äù post so a lot of context is missing but I tried my best - do you have a story of where you broke up and got back together or had a right person wrong time situation and it worked out? We both love eachother so much still and don‚Äôt want to not be together but literally everything was rooting against us and the time apart is happening no matter what now. I really think that it could be the thing we need to come back together stronger as individuals but I‚Äôm trying not to hold on too tight because although we left the door open, we both said not to wait and just experience whatever life wants to have happen.  you‚Äôre free to comment whatever but I would really like to see only positive stories on this here, I have seen a million negative ones already and have heard that I‚Äôm dumb for thinking this could work so that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm seeking positive stories here to see if it‚Äôs possible</Content></post><post><Title>Friday, I'm in love...!

I miss her more than ever</Title><Author>u/OnlyNefariousness865</Author><Content>PRE: Apologies for the possible wall of text, but it's necessary to paint a complete picture.      I (19M) and my (20F, now ex) girlfriend had been together for 7 months and about a month ago we were on the verge of breaking up. Why?      Because I, caught up in some ego-driven moment and taking her for granted, thought it was a good idea to suddenly unload all my issues with her that I had built up until then: the fact that I had to become cold when I perceived coldness from her, the fact that I felt guilty every time I told her I didn't feel like going out, and so on...      Well, we resolved things and got back together, and I deeply regretted trying to leave her: so much so that from that point on I started being more affectionate than ever, with the intention of never letting something like that happen again.      Then yesterday, she complained that I wasn‚Äôt listening to her anymore, that she wanted to feel more understood and I, laughing (Oh, how stupid I was, my God) told her, ‚Äúthen leave me.‚Äù From there followed a series of messages where basically she and I realized there were fundamental problems in our relationship, with lifestyles that were too different and differences that were often only resolved by further conflicts.      The fact is, I practically pushed the narrative of the breakup; she absolutely didn‚Äôt have it in mind. Or rather, she didn‚Äôt have it in mind but when the conversation actually started, she agreed. Let's say it was 60% on my part and 40% on hers.      Well, a day after the breakup, I feel more devastated than ever - sure, I‚Äôve been through breakups before but NEVER with so many emotions involved - and I don‚Äôt know if this decision was the right one. The problem is that it's too late to try to fix things and, again, the dice has been cast.      You might think ‚ÄúWell? What are you waiting for, go get her back!‚Äù      ...I know that even if we tried to force things and get back together, as much as we love each other, we would find other reasons to fight and it wouldn‚Äôt be the same as before. And it‚Äôs all my fault.      I‚Äôm being eaten alive by loneliness, nostalgia, and regret. What do you suggest? Thanks in advance :‚Äô)      TL;DR: my girlfriend and I broke up but I'm not sure it was the right thing to do</Content></post><post><Title>I found my forever love. He is a dream come true. I still sometimes think if this is all real.</Title><Author>u/khushinankani</Author><Content>My boyfriend fell asleep without saying me goodnight. When we talked earlier that night he said that he was exhausted and will pass out soon. It did kinda struck to me that he didn‚Äôt text anything but before I could overthink anything further he texted asking if I am up and when I said yes he LITERALLY CALLED ME to say that he fell asleep and he wanted to say goodnight before he fell asleep again.      Not only that but he has 3 minutes between two tasks at work he will call me, if he is walking from one building to other during work he will call me, he will call me if he is just super slow at work, he will call me from at to his way to eat and go to gym. And so many other times.      Those little things matter a lot. I can‚Äôt express how good he makes me feels when he does that. These random calls and many other small things that he does are really amazing. I like to drink hot water with lemon when I eat and one time we were at a restaurant and I forgot to ask the waiter and he asked to waiter to get it for me. He is everything I have ever wanted and needed. I want to protect and love him at all cost. He is my precious treasure.      I wish more guys realized how long does these small things go. Like what do you mean you remember my go to coffee order? What do you mean you remember my go to song when I am sad. How do you just see me struggling and get to help me? I wish more guys realized that this is what we girls want.

I consistently went to therapy to work on myself, met somebody new, and fell in love again. I thought I was fine. But I was looking at the calendar today and suddenly remembered my ex fianc√©‚Äôs birthday was coming up in a few weeks. Out of nowhere, tears came pouring out. I cried like a baby for 10min straight and my heart was really hurting.

I just wanted to come on here and brag about him a little bit because I think my friends are tired of it. Although he has his short comings, as do I, he has never once made me feel anything less than loved. I have been going through a really hard time, recently came to the realization that my dad could not care less about me (ouch). My boyfriend has held me while I sobbed, been patient during my mood swings and anxiety attacks, and reassured me countless times that he's not going anywhere. He is the most patient, understanding, kind, and gentle man I have ever met besides my grandpa. I have never felt so lucky to be in love with someone. I am so grateful for him not leaving me and sticking by my side through such a hard time.      Although I'm young, I feel extremely lucky to have met someone so early in my life that makes me feel this way.      I hope everyone can feel this feeling at some point in their lives.      EDIT: thank you so much for all of the upvotes! I never thought this post would get this much attention and so many kind words, I‚Äôm going to show him this post so he can see what y‚Äôall said :)</Content></post><post><Title>He's the most supportive person I know. Why do I still feel the need to censor myself?</Title><Author>u/FirewolfTheBrave</Author><Content>We've been together for 6 months now. In the beginning, our communication was lacking, and in retrospect, I do wish we had gotten to know each other better as friends before jumping into a relationship, but we worked on it and learned to be ourselves around each other. Except... I never fully did. I still spend weeks agonizing about how I should bring up a heavy/awkward topic and often never do. It doesn't make sense, I could tell you about so many conversations where I was truly moved by how supportive he was and not a single one where anything I said backfired - there were a couple where he showed less of a reaction than I would have liked, but that's about it. He's also very open with me, our precedent of asking each other for emotional support when we're having a bad day was almost entirely established by him.      I firmly believe that more honesty is the solution, and my first instinct would be to make use of that principle right away and just tell him about this struggle, but the struggle itself is the reason I can't just do that. I just need to stop being embarrassed about everything I say or do for at least long enough to have a normal conversation with him.</Content></post><post><Title>I did it.

You know, I am not even mad at them anymore. I have accepted they are as imperfect as men and that I should act accordingly.</Title><Author>u/___Cesar</Author><Content>I could go on hours on why it doesn‚Äôt but I know that on Reddit it will end up circle-jerking.      Simply put, if love existed, I personally think the same men wouldn‚Äôt be the same left out each time. ¬´Love¬ª is like sports. The number of time of time I saw the same dudes getting a job despite failing a club somewhere else, that‚Äôs exactly like relationships. I have never seen an abusive man alone. I know what I am talking about because I can literally cite 2 men in my family. Women love the same men. I have seen that too many times.      Also the number of times I had to deconstruct things in my head about women, wow‚Ä¶      -¬´Don‚Äôt act too loving at first, that‚Äôs a red flag.¬ª So me showing you that I am serious about you is‚Ä¶Bad ?      -¬´Nice guys are genuinely not good. They are doormats/ they hide their true intentions behind being nice¬ª      I have seen nice guys having a reputation way worst than bullies. That‚Äôs extremely crazy when you think about it.      So a man being nice to a woman because he loves her is bad ? Kind of confused why loving someone = so being extra nice to them has been turned into mental gymnastics scrutiny. While same scrutiny doesn‚Äôt exist for men treating women badly upfront.      Everything in this world, when it comes to romance with women, is wrong. Extremely wrong.      Sometimes, I see dudes asking on Reddit:¬´Do women love men ?¬ª Honestly, I don‚Äôt know. But I can tell you firmly that they don‚Äôt like dudes like me tho.</Content></post><post><Title>Genuine question, how do I tell him my feelings (or lack thereof)?</Title><Author>u/Pupwich</Author><Content>I don‚Äôt know what to do, I don‚Äôt feel like this is really a relationship but more of an elevated friendship yk? I don‚Äôt get butterflies, I don‚Äôt have the constant need to text him or be around him. I do think about him a lot yk, but I feel like texting is a hassle (but I do feel about that with everyone and him being a dry texter doesnt help).      I had feelings in the beginning, excitement and stuff like that. I liked talking but when summer hit and school was out it changed. Just‚Ä¶ faded. I think maybe it was right person wrong time, maybe if we had done this beginning of the year it would‚Äôve been better than a month before school was out.      And then even when school starts up once more, I‚Äôm going to be super busy in the IBDP and won‚Äôt have a bunch of time even for a relationship with someone I won‚Äôt see a bunch at all.      I don‚Äôt know how to tell him, I don‚Äôt want to drag him down.      And then what‚Äôs even worse is that I can‚Äôt even see him, so I‚Äôll have to do it over text</Content></post><post><Title>Giving your whole heart to someone is great isn't it</Title><Author>u/kaiserdragoon67</Author><Content>Except when it's not. When someone can make or break you. Love and romance is often a tragedy met with hardship because the world isn't designed for it. People that just want to live in peace, be with their loved ones, put some good out into the world. We're kind of easy targets. So when I think of the people I love I also feel fear. What will this horrible world do to a family just trying to carve out their own small nook of comfort. They want us broken and corrupted. Oh my family can have nice things if I'm a cutthroat opportunist to the point that I lose myself, great. I've seen individuals actively trying to ruin the livelihood of others for the pettiest reasons. And for what, to feel like the favorite special little helper? Forget integrity, I can pretend to be friends with self serving monsters.      I'm posting this in r/love because I want to make it clear that I am very much in love, and have been for 19 years. I also know the profound happiness and sadness of being a father. It's easy to write about beautiful memories and experiences, or gush over romantic prospects and honeymoon periods. I just know the world has no interest in letting it be. And I don't want that for my daughter. So while I find myself being unable to sell my soul to the devil and kiss the boots of some power tripping snake that wants to gloat over arbitary titles, I still want to make enough money so that she can have more choices. Perhaps even the ability to live in peace. And I want her to still have her mom and dad with their morals intact.      It isn't reality, nobody said life was fair, it could be so much worse, be grateful for what you do have, yada yada. We tell ourselves what we have to, we believe what we have to. But I just want to believe what I know is true. I love my wife and my daughter beyond all the poignant and passionate displays of art and poetry in the world. I am also willing to grind myself to the nub for them, but I can't pretend that it's not fucked up that a family that wishes for nothing but to follow the rules and take care of each other quietly without an ounce of hate simply cannot be if they say we can't. Everyone that wants to live humbly with kindness in their hearts should have that option; the same way evil, organized or not, can live out their fantasies, often at the expense of people like us.</Content></post><post><Title>Genuine question on longterm relationship,marraige and the idea of individual growth and change</Title><Author>u/ApprehensiveBug1141</Author><Content>For the longest time, ive felt that long term relationships can never be happy. Like i usually would view couples had been together for like 2 years and then gotten married, as happier than like couples who have been together for say, 5 to 8 years. I just always felt they werent really in love or happy and we probably bored of each other with no spark. I dont know why ive felt this way, and i would like to address it in therapy.      Ive also heard that, when it comes to long term relationships, people experience a lot of growth and change, in terms of things like life goals, ambition, values, needs etc, and then they become incompatible, and fall out of love at times, then break up. But with marraige, ive noticed people tend to not really say this. Ive felt that change is really inevitable, and if you get into a relationship with someone and youre together for over say, 5 to 9 years, and you both change, similarly a couple who have been together for a long term that started out as compatible will also change. I just feel like, don't we all change in the end? form our 20s to 30s to our 40s, it just feels like we are never done forming and exploring new parts of ourselves, it seems everyone says exploring and changing takes place only in our 20s, but for some does it ever stop, really? Can incompatibility mean that when those changes occur and no compromise can be reached, then its better you both end things.      It seems people bring up that sex in long term relationships gets boring or unexciting too. But does that also happen with marraige as well?      im looking to get perspectives from everyone, and hope i can learn something new today</Content></post><post><Title>After years I once again I feel I'm in love. I kindly need you help.</Title><Author>u/Tiny-Promotion8563</Author><Content>Right now my hands are shaking of joy and sadness for many reasons. I kindly ask you advice upon this matter. In almost my entire life I fell in love only once. Butterflies in the stomach, hypothetical bedtime stories and dreams about a girl. I was too young first in my consciousness and then in everything else. While I was given multiple chances nothing happened (I regretted it later). From then until the age of 18 on the eve of the upcoming Panhellenic exams (in which I started to understood what real anxiety means) I never fell in love even when I had some relationships with women in between. Through my friends I met a girl whom I never paid much attention to throughout the school years. She was a girl sweeter than sugar, with senile prudence and playfulness, with a gentleness befitting a grown woman and a sweetness befitting elementary school children (I cannot describe it perfectly in my second language). Usually when I talked to her it would be few words (I was embarrassed to even curse or say something weird like I did with my friends in front of a person like her). Exams started and discussions at school increased with her day by day. Today after Latin exams due to lack of sleep I collapsed on my mattress and slept for hours. Until at some point a dream began to stimulate all my senses and the brain put spotlights on it. I felt something soft in my hand. A woman's hand caressing mine. Silky smooth and velvety, I swear I can still feel the sensation. I could swear it was her own hand, the same colors, the same voice, the same attitude. It was so beautiful, so unique, so strange. I woke up calm (which doesn't happen often these past few days) and covered in sweat. My heart was beating my chest. My eyes opened wide and my hands started shaking. I don't feel love for this person, I never saw her romantically...Until now probably. But I have never held anyone's hand with such intense love as I held hers in my dream.I can't forget it, it was so uniquely intense. I don't know what to think and what to do. I have one more lesson left (history) to finish the exams and if there is this so called summer of "release" before joining the university (if the grades agree) I don't know if I should make a move or not. For the first time I feel that am afraid to talk to her and for the first time I feel that I am afraid of rejection by her, something that I never really cared about before. I feel alone, I'm shaking all over and I would love absolutely any advice.</Content></post><post><Title>True love does not have conditions it just is‚Ä¶all is one</Title><Author>u/WorstNero777</Author><Content>No content</Content></post><post><Title>Day two of no contact, a letter I wish I could send</Title><Author>u/slenderfingerz</Author><Content>Hi baby,      How are you dealing with everything? I can‚Äôt help but wonder as I go out my day how you are going about yours. I can‚Äôt get the image of you crying while we said goodbye out of my head. All I wanted to do was wipe your tears, run my fingers through your hair, and tell you it‚Äôs okay and that I‚Äôm here but I couldn‚Äôt because that‚Äôs a lie. It‚Äôs not okay, and I‚Äôm not here. I mean, I know it WILL be okay, but it‚Äôs hard to imagine that right now.      Everything reminds me of you. I stare into your dark brown eyes as I look into my cup of coffee, I hear your laugh in the back of my mind when I see something funny I would‚Äôve showed you, I look down at the indentation left on my ring finger and remember the day you slid the promise ring onto it as I cried tears of joy.      I wish I told you I was proud of you more often. I know I‚Äôve told you that before, but I didn‚Äôt tell you it as much as I should have. You‚Äôve been working so hard, I wish I could give you one last backrub while I commend you after a long day.      I haven‚Äôt been sleeping well. I wake up in the middle of the night calling for you before remembering there is no ‚Äúyou‚Äù in my life anymore. For the past two days I‚Äôve woken up and grabbed my phone to text;      ‚ÄúBaby, I just had the worst nightmare‚Äù      just for there to be no heart emoji or contact picture attached to your name anymore.      I know things had to end, we couldn‚Äôt keep running from it, and we couldn‚Äôt just go on both feeling unhappy in this relationship and pretending everything is fine. I know that. I just wish there was some alternate universe where we wanted to same things and were going down the same path and things aligned the way they should have.      After two years of your name sending dopamine to my brain the second it entered my ears, I never thought the same name would bring tears to my eyes and make my heart sink. I think about the time we joked about Pavlov as I realize there truly is a conditioned response attached to your name.      I hate that I can‚Äôt talk to you. I know it‚Äôs the only way we can both heal, but it‚Äôs hard to start my day off without a      ‚ÄúGood morning, my love.‚Äù      There is so much more I have to say, but I guess I‚Äôll have to wrap things up.

After she left the job roughly around the 2 month mark in our relationship things started going downhill, she wasn‚Äôt putting as much effort in, and then her mental health got worse and we broke up in mid January this year. (You can see my post history for more details).      Since then I went though all the stages of a breakup, made mistakes like trying to keep in contact with them, trying to show off on social media etc. I moved past that a while back once I accepted that there wasn‚Äôt any hope of reconciliation. I since removed her off of all social media.      I‚Äôve taken some time to reflect and improve on myself and I got back into dating a few weeks ago. I‚Äôve had 4 dates so far. 2 of which I was catfished. One has lead to FWB but we both know it‚Äôs not gonna go any further as we‚Äôre just not each other‚Äôs type. And the last one there just wasn‚Äôt that romantic spark there so we agreed to remain as friends. I also get ghosted a lot while on these apps. and I‚Äôm honestly starting to loose hope of ever finding someone who I‚Äôm attracted to and have things in common with, and who I might want to be in a relationship with, I know I‚Äôve got that FWB situation going on but I‚Äôm not really just after sex, I want companionship, someone to go on cute dates with and talk to about my day. Before my ex I had completely lost hope then  she came Into my life and I thought at one point that she was the one as she ticked almost every box for me. But in the end she changed after leaving the job where we met. Not just with me but she also cut off all of our mutual friends, who were people she was close to and never fell out with or anything, they were all confused as to why she just stopped talking to everyone.      Idk anymore I know I‚Äôve only been on the apps for 3-4 weeks now which isn‚Äôt that long but I‚Äôm just not getting anywhere it seems. Plus there are loads of girls on there from like a year or two back who I liked and matched with so that doesn‚Äôt exactly fill me with hope.      I consider myself a decent looking guy, I also like to think I‚Äôm very caring and honest. I‚Äôm not one to lie or play games and I know I‚Äôm fiercely loyal when I am with someone. I just don‚Äôt know really what I can do to improve. I also struggle as an alternative person looking for someone else who‚Äôs into the same things as me. The only place I can go really is local clubs but idk how to approach someone in a nightclub I‚Äôm not exactly introverted but I‚Äôm not a social butterfly either.      If any of you have words of wisdom or stories to share please do as I‚Äôm honestly thinking of just giving up at this point.</Content></post><post><Title>I've been experiencing some weird emotional chaos lately, do y'all know how to solve it?</Title><Author>u/OctoBoy4040</Author><Content>2 years ago i was into gacha.

I (19F) have dated twice already since I've been in school so far.      The first story I want to tell is of the first guy(19M) I dated for about 7 months. I had gotten dressed one morning and I didn't think it was raining that hard. I hurried to the Cafe to meet my boyfriend (at the time) and once I got there he asked if I had a Textbook that was needed for my first class of the day. I realized I didn't have it so I ran back to my dorm and back with the book and I was so tired so I just sat down. And for whatever reason, I didn't have my umbrella with me that day. He went to the restroom and came back with paper towels and I didn't think much of it until he knelt down in front of me and used the paper towels to wipe my legs, arms, and glasses from the rain (mind you I was wearing shorts and a short sleeve shirt). I didn't ask him to do this and all I cared about when going through the rain was making sure the Textbook didn't get messed up. It was one of those moments that makes him a rare person to find in life. We both ended things mutually after a while and we're still friends and I wish him luck on finding someone.      The next story is about the second guy(18M) I dated. We dated for about a few weeks and then things didn't end up working out cause neither of us were ready, bur we're still friends. Me and him would watch shows together in the evening after we did all our schoolwork. We would watch animes and cartoons, etc. Often times when we hung out he'd put his arm around me and we'd cuddle and hug. My glasses always ended up sliding and it'd be a hassle to push them up so I used his arm (the one that was around me) to push up my glasses instead. I didn't realize he took note of this and every few minutes he would push up my glasses for me so I could see better. This is a moment that also makes him a rare person to find with his traits and behaviors.      All I'm saying is, don't go searching for this because it will find you. If any of these traits or types of people find you, be lucky and don't let them go.</Content></post><post><Title>Im afraid of falling in love and getting married. Does anyone have any advice for me?</Title><Author>u/Business86</Author><Content>Race: Asian Gender: Male Height: 5‚Äô9 Weight: 160 pounds Medication: klonopin for anxiety Marital history: single, Virgin      I consider myself an overly empathetic person. For some reason, I have a visceral reaction to other people‚Äôs pains/negative experiences.      On Christmas Eve of 2022, my old friend tragically passed away in a car accident. He had just turned 30 and been married only 2 months before he died.      In the summer of 2023, my good friend from high school got a divorce from his wife. In fall of 2023, my long time neighbor got divorced from his wife.      Around Christmas of 2023, I read a story about a man who was truly in love with his wife for many years but She left him to pursue a career in adult films.      All of these stories have left me feeling jaded and numb to the idea of ‚Äútrue love‚Äù. I think about these situations often and although they didn‚Äôt happen to me directly, they do cause me discomfort and stress.      I have never been a relationship or had sex. I think maybe that‚Äôs why I am also thinking about these things a lot?      I think I am just afraid to be in a relationship because I am so terrified it‚Äôs going to end. Whether by death or divorce or some other circumstance. I‚Äôm scared of being heartbroken but at the same time I‚Äôm tired of being lonely all the time. I wish I had a wife I could love and spend time with. I just can‚Äôt get out of this negative feedback loop in my head. Any tips or advice for me?      TL;DR a series of unfortunate events has led me to believe that ‚Äútrue love‚Äù is nonexistent and I have developed an extremely cynical/pessimistic view of romantic relationships between a man and a woman. Any advice for me?</Content></post><post><Title>Who else talks to there S/O all throughout the day?</Title><Author>u/Thunder_Monkey_35</Author><Content>No content</Content></post><post><Title>Why did my (now ex) boyfriend switch up when we started getting serious?</Title><Author>u/LibraryCareful9640</Author><Content>So some back story, I 24f have recently got out of a relationship with a 23m and am trying to get some perspective on the whole thing. We had talked/dated more casually for about 5 months before making it official for the last three.      I didn‚Äôt go into it with the expectation of a relationship and he didn‚Äôt either, but as time went on, and we invested more energy into each other, I began to make my intentions clear about wanting a relationship. We went on dates regularly, had great conversations, I had met his family and friends many times, we had consistent communication outside of hanging out, it was, at the time, a really good dynamic.      However, he was always iffy about committment. He would always say he did want that down the road, but wanted to ‚Äútake things slow‚Äù as he was still working through personal insecurities from a very old relationship. And before anyone says he was using me for s3x, we didn‚Äôt get intimate until we started officially dating, 5 months into it.      At the end of month 5, while having another ambiguous conversation about what he wanted, I finally laid out that I wanted commitment, and if he didn‚Äôt want that, that it was ok, but to leave me alone so we could both find people who wanted the same things. I didn‚Äôt understand why he would treat it like a relationship, and get so worked up about mutual commitment. Essentially his response to that was that loosing me ‚Äúwasn‚Äôt an option‚Äù and he would push his insecurities to the side and work on things for me. Thus, we began our relationship.      Immediately upon dating everything got worse. We stopped going on dates, he stopped putting in effort, all of our conversations revolved around him, he openly admitted to not being interested in my career/life/hobbies/family etc, it was like the first few months was all a fake persona he put up. After three months of this and trying to communicate with him, trying to pickup his slack, and understand the switch, I ended things.      He immediately shifted the blame onto me saying I knew how he felt about committing, and this is what i asked for so he didn‚Äôt get why i was upset. Which i then reiterated how I laid out the option for him to not commit, and find someone who wanted something casual, which he obviously did not choose. I told him he knew his own limitations better than i did/do, and it was his responsibility to be true to himself. I never nagged him for a relationship, i simply communicated what i wanted and said if he didn‚Äôt want that also, to part ways. This response was met with further denial, absolutely no acknowledgment of the person he had turned into/how he was treating me.      He also made comments about wanting to try again down the road when he has his shit together, which i rejected because i believe right person wrong time is an excuse used when someone wants to keep you on the back burner while they play the field. (he‚Äôs In his last year of college and has no real career path, i already have an established career and have had a variety of travel/life experiences)      I guess i want to hear what other people think happened, was he using me to fill a void/stroke his ego? Did he ever care? What made him turn so horrible once he got me? Why would he commit if he didn‚Äôt really want to when i gave him an out??

Maybe you guys can give me some insight and how it looks so far and if any of it doesn't seem to fit.  "It's hard to know where to start with these letters, so I suppose I'll just start at the beginning.When I am around you I feel at ease, like my stress and worries are not so important. When you're gone it feels like I am a wolf without a moon. I am often lost in thought about you and what you're doingI see the way you look at me sometimes with your deep brown eyes and the warm feeling in my chest radiates with so much happiness it's hard for me to contain.When you grab my arm or hand and hold it close to your chest it makes me feel beyond lucky and I'm not sure what I did to deserve it, but I am glad I do.You mentioned to me once how I make you want to keep your place clean. I have felt this way with you since the start. You make me want to be physically fit, have a clean apartment, achieve better goals, strive for a better life, be more outgoing and so much more. You drive me to be a better person and I want to share this new version of myself with you and keep growing together.I often ask if you cast a spell on me because of the strength of these feelings and connection. It came out of nowhere and was so profound and intense as if a lightning strike shocked me back to life.I'm not sure if you like love letters, but I wanted you to have something to look at when you doubt how I feel for you or how much I think about you. I want you to know how much you mean to me and that even in the earliest stages of our relationship I cherish you."    This is what I have so far, maybe I have to trim some of it or adjust some parts but it would be nice to have feedback on what people think of it so far.</Content></post><post><Title>Is it a coincidence or can he actually read my mind.</Title><Author>u/Icy_Teaching_7092</Author><Content>So as of maybe a couple weeks , my bf has been hearing my thoughts like a twin flame or I'm just crazy .

It has been hard to date because you meet decent people but nobody fits everything. Everything includes:      Beauty. Objectively I can say she‚Äôs maybe only slightly above average, but all of her attributes were my type. Like 15/10 in my book. I‚Äôve met ‚Äôtraditionally‚Äò hot 8-10/10, but I would rather have her attributes in a woman.      Personality. Whenever I fall in love it‚Äôs because I can just be myself. I‚Äôve met women I can talk to for hours and just laugh and laugh. She just understood me, I never had to explain anything I said or did. We had amazing chemistry in many different areas, but I would also say she was different in certain views that encouraged me to grow as a person (Ex: I didn‚Äôt really care about travel before, just work). She is also one of the smartest people I know period which was also super cool and fun to talk with.      Nobody is perfect, she has ongoing family trauma and has trouble coping with it. There were ways that strained the relationship. Definitely cares too much about attention and the opinions of others.      The biggest thing I can see giving me the chance to let this all go is ‚Ä¶ love? At the time she loved me, but I can tell she was never really overly crazy about me like I was about her. That definitely is a thing that takes time to build in a new relationship, but what do you all think? Is there a better way to let go of wanting to find someone ‚Äúequal or better‚Äù? What is the best way to find someone that you both can be crazy in love for each other? It seems hard to meet people who even want to try serious relationships nowadays.</Content></post><post><Title>He asked, "are we in love?" So I wrote an essay.</Title><Author>u/MycelliumMinty</Author><Content>This Love Letter is an Essay, this essay is a love letter.      Love, as a word, is lacking. It does not fill the space it aims to take up. It does not fill one with the sense of grandeur that it's trying to represent, nor does it fill the fine details of nuance for any specific love; the love of a friend, of family, of community, or any other. It is such an inadequate syllable. But it's all that the English language gives us to work with.      It is the bane of language, that all things we cannot measure in numbers will be virtually or actually impossible to accurately describe. (Diogenes with a plucked chicken, screaming ‚ÄúBehold, a man!‚Äù) so I can only really report to you that which I can observe.      That I trust you Feel safe with you Feel valued by you That I'm excited to hear from you I Want to have you in my life I'm happier when we talk That I want great things for you      And I feel these things in my physical body as well as my emotional heart. I could also say truthfully that I feel these things for all my friends. How do I express that this feels like even more?      You said you wanted to wait for a bigger moment to say it. And that makes sense. It's a big thing to say to someone the first time, and deserves a sense of cinematic effect. Something to make it memorable.  It makes sense in other ways too. To wait and know for sure that when the initial rush of a new connection washes away, there is still a foundation.      Love is not a firework. Burning bright for a moment then fading away. Love is the fire in the hearth. There is the kindling that starts it all, that burns fast, and that's where we are. But fire needs tending and care to be a comfort. To catch, and not burn out of control.      But to discount a feeling because it is new seems unfair; because it feels like youth, and inexperience. I can't bear to write off what I feel just because I haven't fully learned it's shape.      If I were to love you like the sun tomorrow, would it mean that the candle of what I feel now is something different? I don't believe so. Fire is fire, and love is love. Whatever stage or quantity, things are what they are.      All this is just to say, If you want my feelings in words, I'll say them. If you want to wait for a bit, I will show you in other ways what I feel.</Content></post><post><Title>Can you find love with someone who sells love for a living? Am I wrong for feeding the flames of a toxic relationship?</Title><Author>u/Extension_Offer_8975</Author><Content>I know the title sounds confusing. For quick context, I recently ended a long broken marriage. Either for my looks or lack of social skills I find it really difficult to date, or find women to become interested in me.      Recently had an encounter, let's call it transactional love, with a professional in the matter. Thing is, our connection was, IDK, simply different, for some reason it broke the client-service provider dynamic and it became intimate, passionate, even loving.      She said she felt the same way, we exchanged numbers and have continued contact, to now about our days, things we like, exchange pics, tell each other how much we enjoyed the encounter and other things.      There doesn't seem to be an interest in money or any other benefits other than my company and the fact that she says she's really attracted to me physically. But the fact that I met her on such conditions, and that she continues on that path is somethng that doesn't allow me to be comfortable.      Also, I know what you will think, I can find someone better on my own, let me tell you for the past year I've been going out, to clubs, dancing lessons, gyms, reading clubs, dating is just something that doesn't happen to me no matter how much I try, and this is the closest thing to mutual attraction, care and interest I've had in almost two years.      Honestly I don't know what to do.</Content></post><post><Title>I feel like my depression is ruining our relationship and I can‚Äôt fix it.</Title><Author>u/UncensoredSmoke</Author><Content>I‚Äôm depressed, many reasons none more important then each other.

Tldr; my depression seems to be taking a toll on her and it hurts me seeing her like that.</Content></post><post><Title>After five months gone and several weeks of no contact she came back</Title><Author>u/One_Adeptness_7610</Author><Content>A somewhat long read.      It was 8AM on Sunday morning and I was sitting at my kitchen table just browsing on my laptop at various things. Nothing really important. I'd finished many of the morning chores as I'd been up for a few hours already. The result of being a perpetual early riser. I was calm and relaxed and as I think back now it was one of the first times I've felt that way in several months. For those who know me and have read about what's been happening in my life this feeling has been a rare occurrence.      As I was thinking about the tasks for the day I thought I heard a light knock at my back door. My dog was stirring but not overly excited. He's the type that will jump and whine with excitement whenever someone comes by. This time he was quite calm and I had to question if I even heard anything at all. I decided I should have a look. As I got closer to the door I looked out the window beside it and saw someone I thought I'd not see for several more months if at all ever. I paused for a moment as I looked and I can only imagine the expression I reflected back.      There she stood looking back at me with a nervous look herself. We hadn't seen eachother since early February when she had come back to retrieve a few items for a trip. I opened the door and we just looked at eachother for what seemed like hours. I spoke first and said "I didn't think I'd ever see you again". She responded with "I'm just here to get my tax information and some clothes". I asked if she was just back today. She said she'd been in town a week and was hiding out at her dad's house. I invited her in and she ask me for a hug. He request surprised me but I obliged. It was awkward and familiar at the same time. I said "let's talk" and motioned to go back outside to the padio. I offered her water and a jacket as it was there was still the morning coolness in the air.      As she began to talk it was easy to see she was nervous. I can't say I was much better but I thought I held it together quite well. She picked at me about things she'd heard about and noticed. Things such as me having a yard sale and her garden trinkets all being removed. All I could really say was that as far as I knew she was never coming back and I was cleaning up my life and moving forward to rebuild. She wasn't really happy with any of it but what would she or anyone else do in the situation had the roles been reversed? She'd been gone for five months and we hadn't talked at all in several weeks. She mentioned that we were supposed to talk on the mother's day Sunday and thought that I'd call her. Obviously I didn't and I think it was best I didn't call and we didn't talk. I needed the emotional break to heal from the crumbling of out relationship and all the what can only really be called toxic communication afterwards. We weren't acidic towards on another but it was easy to see I clearly wanted to work things out while she didn't.      After an hour of us sitting and talking she said she needed to use the washroom. Of course she's welcome to. Everyone needs to at some point. She came in the house and what happened next really angered me. She went past the bathroom and walked into my oldest son's room (he's 20) and curled up in bed with him. When I heard her open his door I walked down the hall to see what was going on. All I could do was stand in amazement with what I was seeing. I turned and walked into my youngest son's room (he's 18) to wake him and warn him about what was happening and what I knew was about to happen to him. Moments later she did the same to him. In intrest of not causing more trouble I allowed it to happen. About thirty seconds later I looked at her and said sternly "OUTSIDE". Of course she obliged. After a decade together she knows when I'm bothered.      I'm generally considered to be a calm and reserved man. I've always been and often to a fault. It's caused me trouble many times over the years. The trouble almost entirely being my inability to set a hold the much needed boundaries in life. I can say I've learned many lessons in the last five months and if anything what I've learned through this whole ordeal has been to better control my emotions when someone oversteps my boundaries. She knowingly did just that and most likely thinking I'd react the same as I once did. She was mistaken.      As she sat back down on the padio chair I said to her "I really wish you hadn't done that". She knew I was upset but still looked at me with bewilderment. I told her how inappropriate her actions were. I spoke about the trouble it would cause with them. Yes, I understand they're both men now and can absorb the variety of pitfalls life will throw at them. Regardless showing up and trying to act like not much has changed is just wrong. Numerous times I said all actions have consequences and her were no different. She attempted to try telling me they were her sons as well but I stopped her and reminded her that the three of us are a package deal. Cut me out and you cut them out as well. To contrast she has a son (currently 25) from her first marriage that she never really made me and my sons part of. I let her know the hypocrisy of it and the trouble it caused. I asked her what she wanted out of life for herself, for me and for us or what we were. She had no answer and just looked at me blankly. Mixed families are difficult at the best of times and all manner of integration should be attempted. It's unfortunate it wasn't. I hear her son is a half decent person albeit somewhat cold. Regardless both of my sons have seen the pain I've endured over the months and really years of our relationship the hypocrisys in it and downfall of it. Ignorance is bliss and that's the look I got from her. Truthful? Who knows? Who cares?      For the most part I was able to keep my composure. For the most part... I did raise my voice a bit and I'm sure she could see the anger and frustration in my eyes. I'm far from being a violent man and lucky for the world that I'm not. At 50 years old I'm a shadow of what I once was physically but there's still a good amount there. I walked away after a few minutes of me letting her know just how I felt about everything saying I needed to cool off. I came back and sat down in front of her moments later and said "OK I'm done". I was calm. She said she had a blast for me too. I said "let's hear it" but she declined saying she wasn't ready. I doubt she was being truthful on it. Not to boast and I'm sure it's people just trying to help me fee better but I've herd many times over the last several months that she was lucky to have me and all thst i did for her. I know I'm not without my flaws and faults but perception is everything. She apologized for how things happened and we began talking again.      Years ago she wanted to vist a naturopath. She felt it would be helpful for a variety of reasons. I always supported her but for one reason after another it didn't happen. She finally did a month after she left. She opened up a bit about her experience and what was discovered. She tells me the bacteria in her stomach is far from normal. I asked her what that meant and she told me it can cause inflammation in many different ways. It can cause various types of aches and pains. And that it can effect brain chemistry and mental health as well. I have no idea if there's any truth to what she told me. It sounded more like a justification for her actions than anything  but I don't know. She didn't show me any literature on it or even give me a technical term to research. Regardless, if there's any truth to it, it would explain a great deal of the chaos that has been building over the last few years. I asked her what can be done and she told me she's taking supplements to try and correct it.      As we talked she noticed the garden I built years ago. It was beginning to bloom. She got up and began pulling weeds and talked about what each plant was and what it would do. She thanked me for building it for her and the enjoyment it gave to her and I both. This went on for a while. It almost seemed like old times. After some time I stopped her and said that maybe it was time she got what she came for and that maybe later we could meet and talk more. She said it felt surreal being here. She also said that she wasn't ready to work on us yet. "Yet". That caught my attention. But really, after everything what makes her think that's what I want? Relationships involve two people. Not just one wanting. I believe I did more than my fair share of it. She says to me "you know I have beliefs and maybe the chapter we had is the end of a really great story". I agreed and we both went in the house.      Within a half hour she had gathered what she came for. It wasn't much. She noticed how I had mostly removed her from most of the house. It wasn't an easy task for me and I know it hurt her to see it but what am I to do? I/we can't put our lives on hold. She said goodbye to the boys and I walked her back out to her dad's car. I said "see you in a few hours". She nodded an OK, got in the car and drove off.      She messaged me about a half hour later canceling. I expected as much and responded with an "OK". She thanked me for the time today. I didn't respond.      I have no idea what to think anymore. I crave peace.</Content></post><post><Title>Is it hard for someone who is asexual to find true love?</Title><Author>u/devinliudashuaige</Author><Content>I've lost two partners because of my low sex drive. They both said they could accept it at first, but eventually realized they couldn't.      It's been a tough journey trying to navigate relationships while being asexual. When I first met my exes, everything seemed perfect. We connected on so many levels‚Äîshared interests, deep conversations, mutual respect. They assured me that my lack of sexual interest wasn't a problem. I believed them and thought I had finally found someone who truly understood me.      However, as time went on, the cracks started to show. Intimacy became a recurring issue. Despite their initial acceptance, they started expressing frustration. They felt neglected and unfulfilled, and no matter how much I tried to compensate in other areas, it wasn't enough. The emotional strain became too much to bear, leading to painful breakups.      This pattern has made me question whether true love is possible for someone like me. Society places a high value on sexual compatibility, and it often feels like a relationship can't thrive without it. This makes it incredibly difficult for asexual people to find partners who can genuinely accept and embrace their orientation.      I‚Äôve tried to educate my partners about asexuality, hoping to bridge the gap. There are moments of understanding and empathy, but when reality sets in, the physical aspect of the relationship overshadows everything else. It‚Äôs disheartening because I believe love should be more than just physical attraction. It should be about emotional connection, support, and companionship.      Recently, I've been exploring communities where asexuality is better understood and accepted. Meeting people who share similar experiences has been enlightening and comforting. It's a reminder that I'm not alone and that there are people out there who value the same things I do in a relationship.</Content></post><post><Title>A goodbye summer letter for my ex boyfriend who i still love</Title><Author>u/Adorable-Menu7301</Author><Content>Me and my ex broke up but I still love him and I'm getting better.

I never really asked my friends and family about this and kinda curious, so i decided to hear what the internet has to say about it.      A little bit of introduction, I've been single my whole life. Over the years i fell in love with some girls but never had much luck. I put much effort into it, tried to get myself to look better, i tried to make them as happy as possible. But usually some guys that they met at work or have easier access to talk to them regularly snatched them away with ease. It keeps happening ever since i was 14 when i fell in love for the first time until today (i'm 31 now).      Thx for taking your time to read, feel free to leave a comment if you feel like it. Have a nice day üòä</Content></post><post><Title>To the first and last love of my life: do you remember us?</Title><Author>u/Bob_Sava_K</Author><Content>What happened to us      I still remember holding your hand for the first time. Smiling at you. Your smile. Us watching our fav series in my car because outside was too cold for you.      The first time we met was at the cinema. Both looked for the other's hand despite having never met before. It's destiny, we kept saying.      We were happy. There were so many hardships, but I was always thinking of your happiness. After years, I was able to find a job. One that would let me take you away from a toxic environment. Finally I could pay you back for your support.      But I was blind. I couldn't notice you getting colder and colder as your darkness grew. All the bad things that happened to you turned you into one of the toxic people you wanted to free yourself from.      You got to know another guy. First, it was us three. He was my friend after all. But then my presence meant nothing to you. You started talking about him when we were alone. And I finally knew it was over. You said he was a brother to you. Yet... it happened.      And you told me you loved both of us. I told you to choose, knowing what would happen. You told me you can't choose. So I went away by myself. And you didn't even feel remorse. There was no hesitation. You didn't even try to get me back but you still claimed to love me.      I wonder, how could you erase me so easily while I'm still here, thinking of videocalling you when something funny happens?      I'm so hurt that I hate you deeply now. I hope you'll feel regret one day. I'm afraid of my new thoughts. I never yelled, I never got mad. I would hug you when you cried. I used to fight against your parents.      I remember the birthday surprises. I remember how we used to play together. I remember getting you Pok√©mon card packs whenever I'd come back from work. I remember the time you watched an old movie from my childhood with me. I remember you thanking me for giving you back your lost childhood by buying you videogames.      Where has it all gone? What did I ever do to you? Even you said "Oh I thought we were fine". You didn't even tell me. Why did you have to go?      We used to talk about our future, now we don't even exist to each other. I don't have your number anymore because it really hurt to have. I would be afraid of seeing you with him in your pfp. I'm afraid of seeing you with him on the road. In our last call, you told me you only care about the present now. And it broke me.      I hate you now, but that sweet illusion was everything to me. Every photo I delete is a tear I shed.</Content></post><post><Title>What's Worse? Is he cheating or are you self sabotaging?</Title><Author>u/Medium-Combination44</Author><Content>Is it worse to push someone away who truly loves and cares for you and wouldn't hurt you because your betrayal trauma is so deep you can't accept that someone actually wants to love you? Or would you rather convince yourself they're a horrible person and self sabotage a beautiful gift from the universe? Personally I think it's worse to wake up and realize that the person you've been accusing of cheating and not truly loving you, actually does truly love and care for you and would never hurt or betray you and the entire relationship you've been unknowingly emotionally abusing them because you've been betrayed in the past and your fear of being betrayed is hurting someone with a beautiful heart. And there's nothing worse then a loyal person who desires loyalty back, to ruin the very thing they hope for and also unintentionally hurt a beautiful person with good intentions.</Content></post><post><Title>I would like to have some strength to hold on</Title><Author>u/Inevitable-Face6615</Author><Content>If you have any questions go ahead in the comments.      I am currently trying my best to get back the love of my life. We were together for little least than 4 years. I love her a lot. We broke up 6 months ago due to us not knowing how to resolve fights. I think I have done a lot of reflecting on us and have realised how she has dealt with and acknowledged me while I haven‚Äôt noticed that in the relationship.      The last 2 weeks I talked with her a lot how serious I am about the whole situation, and that I am of course fighting for us because I know deep down we are meant to be.      During the breakup a lot has happened and I wasn‚Äôt the most supportive to her. I wasn‚Äôt mean but just not there for her.      During the 2 weeks we have spoken a lot but she said she hasn‚Äôt done the reflecting because she buried everything inside of her and has trouble feeling big feelings and she is very very confused on what she wants. I know she has to fight her demons that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm understanding. But she said right now she just isn‚Äôt ready and is super sorry that she can‚Äôt give me an answer. But at the end she said this doesn‚Äôt feel like a good bye. Then I said well then maybe it‚Äôs just a see you later.      She dropped me off at her train station and we both gave eachother a pinky promise that if she ever has made up her mind she has to give me a call. Doesn‚Äôt matter when and where. And she made me promise of I wait for her but end up finding a girl I should take my shot of happiness (movie reference) and take the girl.      I told her that I promised to fight for her as she did for me in the beginning of the relationship so I will wait.      Now recently I‚Äôm fighting with myself for how long I should wait and fight for her because if I wait half a year and then she doesn‚Äôt come, I have wasted so much time. On the other hand we are so young (22) that if she is the love of my life I‚Äôll wait a year it‚Äôs not the end of the world.      Please please ask away or tell me some encouraging experience.  What I don‚Äôt want to hear is to ‚Äûmove on and grow a pair‚Äú if it‚Äôs something constructive or helpful I‚Äôm open to everything. I just want her back.</Content></post><post><Title>Do I consider a relationship with my ex again when his whole family is too involved?</Title><Author>u/littletwinklepink</Author><Content>So my ex 28M and I 28F were together for 3 years before I had ended it. I truly never believe I will love anyone like that again, our connection is very strong and it was from the beginning. The issue was I have a very non-traditional background and he came from Persian culture. He had been very sheltered growing up and he had a big fear of his parents. It felt like we were walking on eggshells from the beginning. On top of that the judgment and pressure I felt from his family caused me to develop depression and anxiety. I knew he never had strong relationships outside his family before and it was just me. it felt like we were always putting out fires and by the time it got to us it seemed like we didn't want to talk about anything we were dealing with ourselves.      The situation got messier when I went to go live with one of his family members when I started college. His dad's cousin, who lived really close to my school, formed a strong relationship with me and she is now involved in the relationship as well. We are Ex's and friends but she does not approve and says I should cut all ties with his family because his parents will never allow peace. His dad called her and told her to kick me out to which she said she can't be told what to do. I had coffee with him after 6 months of not seeing each other and his mom blew up and locked him out of the house. He has taken a big step in demanding respect for his decisions as an adult and he has defended me time after time but they do not respect his boundaries. I do not want to be the one to tell him to cut them off because it will seem like it comes out of a place of animosity from me but realistically I do not think they will understand anything else if he has already done this much. At the moment he is basically a pariah in his home but he says he won't ignore me again and he does not want to live like he did before and he doesn't care he will deal with it. His cousin told me to block him and now I am upset more people are involved.      On top of that nobody in my life likes him because they saw the toll it took on me to deal with his families judgement and him trying to navigate and keep everyone happy for so long. I don't want to abandon him, he is more alone than ever now but I do not know if we are compatible because of the difference in dynamics we were raised in. It is really hard to not be with him but it is also so much nicer in my life when I felt free of his families pressures. we haven't been together for about a year now. Has anyone dealt with anything similar?</Content></post><post><Title>Went on this thread to ask if any of you all married your first love?</Title><Author>u/Jet_Golden</Author><Content>Have any of ya'll married your first love?

I want to have someone in my life i can open up to, someone that will not judge me, someone that could somehow love me, but i reject this idea at the same time. I dont really know how to describe it with words, but i was alone for so long, in every ways, that i cant connect with anyone. My life feels so empty that even if i try, i dont even know how to present myself to someone, or share anything about me or my life : there is nothing to share. I want to connect with people again, but i feel like it s gonna be a 1 way experience were i learn someone else, and this someone else will get nothing from me in return. I m not ugly, i m not stupid by any mean, but i very much lack the emotional capacity of a "regular" personn. No emotions on my face, never talks unless spoken to, so never talk, no projects for the future, no hobbies, no friends, never goes out,... Etc. For me, living is waiting to die later at this point. How do i get out of this mess ? How do i connect with people ? How do i make friends again ? I guess i just want at least one person to think or care about me, to feel less invisible. I just want someone to remind me that i exist too. I just want someone to speak to and laugh with. I just want someone, anyone.</Content></post><post><Title>Anyone with very atypical love stories? "Doubts-they were the one" // "they are the one-breakup"?</Title><Author>u/Kat_Dalf2719</Author><Content>Basically the title.      Nowadays the only love stories that seem to work are the ones they sell in movies and romance books where at first there is a strong spark, a click and a "we are just made for each other" feeling that lasts for life.      Out of curiosity I wanted to know if someone has love stories that deviate from these stereotypes. I'm not saying they are bad, far from the truth! They are very appealing and I have experienced those feelings in the past.      I'm thinking maybe about finding out that someone you felt doubts with turned out to be "the one" for you after time, experiences and working together. Or reversed: someone you felt this instant click and connection with, thought that you were going to get married since minute 1, turned out to be a complete disaster and thought "how could I feel this way".</Content></post><post><Title>Needing hope about finding love again after ending a 4 year relationship</Title><Author>u/eventures12</Author><Content>I (26F) ended a four year relationship with my ex boyfriend because it began to get toxic and emotionally abusive. I still hear and internalize all the mean things he said about me and how he  insulted me. I wasn‚Äôt the perfect partner either but didn‚Äôt insult him or criticize etc. I tried to be the best I could. I have unresolved childhood trauma that I‚Äôve been working through with a therapist before I met him, and was while we dated. I‚Äôm still with the same therapist now just working all of this out.      It hurts because I seriously thought this person was the person I was going to marry. It doesn‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôm going to find a love that will be better. I know the love won‚Äôt be the exact same, but still. I just can‚Äôt imagine finding love again. I feel like I‚Äôll be so scared and hypervigilant about waiting for the other shoe to drop, like maybe it‚Äôll be the same thing all over again with someone else and no one will ever see me for who I truly am and what I deserve. I‚Äôm the type of person who loves really hard, but my ex bf wasn‚Äôt doing his work and refused to accept the internal work he needed to be doing (getting over his own childhood traumas as well).      We shared a cat together and I don‚Äôt have the him anymore which sucks. My partner bought it for me, but I wasn‚Äôt going to take it away from him since it‚Äôs technically his. I miss my cat a lot. üò≠      Just looking for some hope and wondering if anyone found their person after being in a bad/unhealthy relationship.</Content></post><post><Title>I'm starting to have severe doubts I'll ever be worthy of love</Title><Author>u/HypocrisyNation</Author><Content>This will be buried and i'm not sure if this is relevant to the sub but honestly I need to actually get this off my chest because I can't anymore.      I'm so done with dating or even considering the fact that I will ever be in a healthy long-term relationship. I am in my early 20s and my dating expriences have been horrible. From my 3 partners 2 cheated on me, one of whom was apparently with so many people "only she knows how many for sure" (words of a mutual friend), the other was just a very unhealthy relationship.I recognise that I have not been the perfect partner and have flaws that I am working on/have worked on. I try and refuse to believe that I am fundamentally broken and unworthy of love.      It is so hard though. Modern dating is just awful. Tried dating apps and it was just depressing with the constant swiping and the ones who do match would just ignore any messages I would send. Since my relationships I've been on dates and just nothing works. I've tried every approach, whether it's the "just let it come to you and work on yourself" to just trying to completely change my personality in order for someone to just actually like me romantically. Nothing changes.      I am starting to believe that there is something fundamentally wrong with me. That there is a part of my soul that is repulsive, that I am a toxin that repels everything I touch and corrodes the things I do hold unto. I don't know what it is, I'd like to think I'm quite social and have a fair amount of friends, whether male or female and I'm told by others that I am outgoing. I'm just an embarrassment it seems.      I had been talking to a girl who's interested in the same things I am and showed an interest of me in the past. I said yesterday I was going to be in her town (which I am) and I'd love to hear more about her over dinner or drinks and she simply hasn't responded for a day so now I'm just blocking her on everything, because I don't want to burden her with the task of rejecting me politely or making her awkward/uncomfortable.      People may read this and say that im being negative. I don't think it's down to looks at all, I think there is something deep in my soul that makes me unworthy of  love on a fundamental level. I actually believe that when cheating on me or turning me down that these women are making the rational desicion, and I can't help that.      I want to be loved because to me it is a justification for my existence on this earth, it is an approval of all of me, not just one part of me or just my personality or just my looks. I want someone to look at all of me and think "yes, I love every bit of him".      What can i do to become something worth loving? How do i become inherently lovable? I just want to buy someone flowers man, I feel like I have so much love to give and I just want to be able to project it.</Content></post><post><Title>Hi. This is my first post, and I wonder if I just found my soulmate.</Title><Author>u/Polaricedragon</Author><Content>I was going through my lowest point in life, and everything just kept getting worse little by little. I've been slowly climbing out of the hole, and I thought that I should try to date since I had nothing to lose. So I did, and met this girl on Facebook. She's amazing, and we went to a Caf√© for some coffee together as a first date. We instantly hit it off with sharing some stories, and getting to know each other for over 3 hours straight.      After that we exanged numbers, and kept talking to each other for about over a week. My feelings for her slowly grew until she texted on how I was very kind, and respectful, and she called me a angel. So I confessed. After a bit, she confessed back, and we instantly planned to meet again the next day. I felt very nervous, and shaky during our second date, and I asked for a hug. She accepted, and gave me a hug, and then she gave me my first kiss. Telling me that she'll always be there, and that she truly loves me. We then talked more about each other for another couple of hours till we departed once again.      Now we text each other on how we already miss each other, and that we want to be together forever. Meeting about 2 or 3 times a month, and taking it slow from here. Not wanting to get to..... that point of intimacy until she's ready, and more comfortable with the idea. I agreed, and we already have another date planned, and I can't wait to see her again.</Content></post><post><Title>I‚Äôm really struggling and I don‚Äôt know what the heck to do.

I'm also super down too, because of my mental health related depression, and I feel like all we're able to talk about is the depressing stuff. I feel like all we're able to feel is sadness, and I hate it, because I know that even though we both want this to work, it won't if this is all we can do. I need help. I really need help here, because she's the first one who hasn't used me, who hasn't lied to me, who hasn't been a bad choice.

I think my issue is that I don‚Äôt believe it can happen for me so I self reject myself before it can happen. I also feel like why should I waste someone‚Äôs time if I think it won‚Äôt be the one?

We had talked/dated more casually for about 5 months before making it official for the last three.      I didn‚Äôt go into it with the expectation of a relationship and he didn‚Äôt either, but as time went on, and we invested more energy into each other, I began to make my intentions clear about wanting a relationship. We went on dates regularly, had great conversations, I had met his family and friends many times, we had consistent communication outside of hanging out, it was, at the time, a really good dynamic.      However, he was always iffy about committment. He would always say he did want that down the road, but wanted to ‚Äútake things slow‚Äù as he was still working through personal insecurities from a very old relationship. And before anyone says he was using me for s3x, we didn‚Äôt get intimate until we started officially dating, 5 months into it.      At the end of month 5, while having another ambiguous conversation about what he wanted, I finally laid out that I wanted commitment, and if he didn‚Äôt want that, that it was ok, but to leave me alone so we could both find people who wanted the same things. I didn‚Äôt understand why he would treat it like a relationship, and get so worked up about mutual commitment. Essentially his response to that was that loosing me ‚Äúwasn‚Äôt an option‚Äù and he would push his insecurities to the side and work on things for me. Thus, we began our relationship.      Immediately upon dating everything got worse. We stopped going on dates, he stopped putting in effort, all of our conversations revolved around him, he openly admitted to not being interested in my career/life/hobbies/family etc, it was like the first few months was all a fake persona he put up. After three months of this and trying to communicate with him, trying to pickup his slack, and understand the switch, I ended things.      He immediately shifted the blame onto me saying I knew how he felt about committing, and this is what i asked for so he didn‚Äôt get why i was upset. Which i then reiterated how I laid out the option for him to not commit, and find someone who wanted something casual, which he obviously did not choose. I told him he knew his own limitations better than i did/do, and it was his responsibility to be true to himself. I never nagged him for a relationship, i simply communicated what i wanted and said if he didn‚Äôt want that also, to part ways. This response was met with further denial, absolutely no acknowledgment of the person he had turned into/how he was treating me.      He also made comments about wanting to try again down the road when he has his shit together, which i rejected because i believe right person wrong time is an excuse used when someone wants to keep you on the back burner while they play the field. (he‚Äôs In his last year of college and has no real career path, i already have an established career and have had a variety of travel/life experiences)      I guess i want to hear what other people think happened, was he using me to fill a void/stroke his ego? Did he ever care? What made him turn so horrible once he got me? Why would he commit if he didn‚Äôt really want to when i gave him an out??

Maybe you guys can give me some insight and how it looks so far and if any of it doesn't seem to fit.  "It's hard to know where to start with these letters, so I suppose I'll just start at the beginning.When I am around you I feel at ease, like my stress and worries are not so important. When you're gone it feels like I am a wolf without a moon. I am often lost in thought about you and what you're doingI see the way you look at me sometimes with your deep brown eyes and the warm feeling in my chest radiates with so much happiness it's hard for me to contain.When you grab my arm or hand and hold it close to your chest it makes me feel beyond lucky and I'm not sure what I did to deserve it, but I am glad I do.You mentioned to me once how I make you want to keep your place clean. I have felt this way with you since the start. You make me want to be physically fit, have a clean apartment, achieve better goals, strive for a better life, be more outgoing and so much more. You drive me to be a better person and I want to share this new version of myself with you and keep growing together.I often ask if you cast a spell on me because of the strength of these feelings and connection. It came out of nowhere and was so profound and intense as if a lightning strike shocked me back to life.I'm not sure if you like love letters, but I wanted you to have something to look at when you doubt how I feel for you or how much I think about you. I want you to know how much you mean to me and that even in the earliest stages of our relationship I cherish you."    This is what I have so far, maybe I have to trim some of it or adjust some parts but it would be nice to have feedback on what people think of it so far.</Content></post><post><Title>Is it a coincidence or can he actually read my mind.</Title><Author>u/Icy_Teaching_7092</Author><Content>So as of maybe a couple weeks , my bf has been hearing my thoughts like a twin flame or I'm just crazy .

It has been hard to date because you meet decent people but nobody fits everything. Everything includes:      Beauty. Objectively I can say she‚Äôs maybe only slightly above average, but all of her attributes were my type. Like 15/10 in my book. I‚Äôve met ‚Äôtraditionally‚Äò hot 8-10/10, but I would rather have her attributes in a woman.      Personality. Whenever I fall in love it‚Äôs because I can just be myself. I‚Äôve met women I can talk to for hours and just laugh and laugh. She just understood me, I never had to explain anything I said or did. We had amazing chemistry in many different areas, but I would also say she was different in certain views that encouraged me to grow as a person (Ex: I didn‚Äôt really care about travel before, just work). She is also one of the smartest people I know period which was also super cool and fun to talk with.      Nobody is perfect, she has ongoing family trauma and has trouble coping with it. There were ways that strained the relationship. Definitely cares too much about attention and the opinions of others.      The biggest thing I can see giving me the chance to let this all go is ‚Ä¶ love? At the time she loved me, but I can tell she was never really overly crazy about me like I was about her. That definitely is a thing that takes time to build in a new relationship, but what do you all think? Is there a better way to let go of wanting to find someone ‚Äúequal or better‚Äù? What is the best way to find someone that you both can be crazy in love for each other? It seems hard to meet people who even want to try serious relationships nowadays.</Content></post><post><Title>He asked, "are we in love?" So I wrote an essay.</Title><Author>u/MycelliumMinty</Author><Content>This Love Letter is an Essay, this essay is a love letter.      Love, as a word, is lacking. It does not fill the space it aims to take up. It does not fill one with the sense of grandeur that it's trying to represent, nor does it fill the fine details of nuance for any specific love; the love of a friend, of family, of community, or any other. It is such an inadequate syllable. But it's all that the English language gives us to work with.      It is the bane of language, that all things we cannot measure in numbers will be virtually or actually impossible to accurately describe. (Diogenes with a plucked chicken, screaming ‚ÄúBehold, a man!‚Äù) so I can only really report to you that which I can observe.      That I trust you Feel safe with you Feel valued by you That I'm excited to hear from you I Want to have you in my life I'm happier when we talk That I want great things for you      And I feel these things in my physical body as well as my emotional heart. I could also say truthfully that I feel these things for all my friends. How do I express that this feels like even more?      You said you wanted to wait for a bigger moment to say it. And that makes sense. It's a big thing to say to someone the first time, and deserves a sense of cinematic effect. Something to make it memorable.  It makes sense in other ways too. To wait and know for sure that when the initial rush of a new connection washes away, there is still a foundation.      Love is not a firework. Burning bright for a moment then fading away. Love is the fire in the hearth. There is the kindling that starts it all, that burns fast, and that's where we are. But fire needs tending and care to be a comfort. To catch, and not burn out of control.      But to discount a feeling because it is new seems unfair; because it feels like youth, and inexperience. I can't bear to write off what I feel just because I haven't fully learned it's shape.      If I were to love you like the sun tomorrow, would it mean that the candle of what I feel now is something different? I don't believe so. Fire is fire, and love is love. Whatever stage or quantity, things are what they are.      All this is just to say, If you want my feelings in words, I'll say them. If you want to wait for a bit, I will show you in other ways what I feel.</Content></post><post><Title>Can you find love with someone who sells love for a living? Am I wrong for feeding the flames of a toxic relationship?</Title><Author>u/Extension_Offer_8975</Author><Content>I know the title sounds confusing. For quick context, I recently ended a long broken marriage. Either for my looks or lack of social skills I find it really difficult to date, or find women to become interested in me.      Recently had an encounter, let's call it transactional love, with a professional in the matter. Thing is, our connection was, IDK, simply different, for some reason it broke the client-service provider dynamic and it became intimate, passionate, even loving.      She said she felt the same way, we exchanged numbers and have continued contact, to now about our days, things we like, exchange pics, tell each other how much we enjoyed the encounter and other things.      There doesn't seem to be an interest in money or any other benefits other than my company and the fact that she says she's really attracted to me physically. But the fact that I met her on such conditions, and that she continues on that path is somethng that doesn't allow me to be comfortable.      Also, I know what you will think, I can find someone better on my own, let me tell you for the past year I've been going out, to clubs, dancing lessons, gyms, reading clubs, dating is just something that doesn't happen to me no matter how much I try, and this is the closest thing to mutual attraction, care and interest I've had in almost two years.      Honestly I don't know what to do.</Content></post><post><Title>I feel like my depression is ruining our relationship and I can‚Äôt fix it.</Title><Author>u/UncensoredSmoke</Author><Content>I‚Äôm depressed, many reasons none more important then each other. My girlfriend is so amazing, she‚Äôs the highlight of my day, I love her so much, one of my favourite people. Everyday with her feels like a dream.      I just can‚Äôt help this feeling that my depression is sort of ruining the mood, I‚Äôm not very emotional available right now, and my insecurities tell me I‚Äôm not good enough for her anyways. We‚Äôve been together 6 months now and her birthday is in 2 days, trying my hardest to mask until then so she can have a good birthday.

Tldr; my depression seems to be taking a toll on her and it hurts me seeing her like that.</Content></post><post><Title>After five months gone and several weeks of no contact she came back</Title><Author>u/One_Adeptness_7610</Author><Content>A somewhat long read.      It was 8AM on Sunday morning and I was sitting at my kitchen table just browsing on my laptop at various things. Nothing really important. I'd finished many of the morning chores as I'd been up for a few hours already. The result of being a perpetual early riser. I was calm and relaxed and as I think back now it was one of the first times I've felt that way in several months. For those who know me and have read about what's been happening in my life this feeling has been a rare occurrence.      As I was thinking about the tasks for the day I thought I heard a light knock at my back door. My dog was stirring but not overly excited. He's the type that will jump and whine with excitement whenever someone comes by. This time he was quite calm and I had to question if I even heard anything at all. I decided I should have a look. As I got closer to the door I looked out the window beside it and saw someone I thought I'd not see for several more months if at all ever. I paused for a moment as I looked and I can only imagine the expression I reflected back.      There she stood looking back at me with a nervous look herself. We hadn't seen eachother since early February when she had come back to retrieve a few items for a trip. I opened the door and we just looked at eachother for what seemed like hours. I spoke first and said "I didn't think I'd ever see you again". She responded with "I'm just here to get my tax information and some clothes". I asked if she was just back today. She said she'd been in town a week and was hiding out at her dad's house. I invited her in and she ask me for a hug. He request surprised me but I obliged. It was awkward and familiar at the same time. I said "let's talk" and motioned to go back outside to the padio. I offered her water and a jacket as it was there was still the morning coolness in the air.      As she began to talk it was easy to see she was nervous. I can't say I was much better but I thought I held it together quite well. She picked at me about things she'd heard about and noticed. Things such as me having a yard sale and her garden trinkets all being removed. All I could really say was that as far as I knew she was never coming back and I was cleaning up my life and moving forward to rebuild. She wasn't really happy with any of it but what would she or anyone else do in the situation had the roles been reversed? She'd been gone for five months and we hadn't talked at all in several weeks. She mentioned that we were supposed to talk on the mother's day Sunday and thought that I'd call her. Obviously I didn't and I think it was best I didn't call and we didn't talk. I needed the emotional break to heal from the crumbling of out relationship and all the what can only really be called toxic communication afterwards. We weren't acidic towards on another but it was easy to see I clearly wanted to work things out while she didn't.      After an hour of us sitting and talking she said she needed to use the washroom. Of course she's welcome to. Everyone needs to at some point. She came in the house and what happened next really angered me. She went past the bathroom and walked into my oldest son's room (he's 20) and curled up in bed with him. When I heard her open his door I walked down the hall to see what was going on. All I could do was stand in amazement with what I was seeing. I turned and walked into my youngest son's room (he's 18) to wake him and warn him about what was happening and what I knew was about to happen to him. Moments later she did the same to him. In intrest of not causing more trouble I allowed it to happen. About thirty seconds later I looked at her and said sternly "OUTSIDE". Of course she obliged. After a decade together she knows when I'm bothered.      I'm generally considered to be a calm and reserved man. I've always been and often to a fault. It's caused me trouble many times over the years. The trouble almost entirely being my inability to set a hold the much needed boundaries in life. I can say I've learned many lessons in the last five months and if anything what I've learned through this whole ordeal has been to better control my emotions when someone oversteps my boundaries. She knowingly did just that and most likely thinking I'd react the same as I once did. She was mistaken.      As she sat back down on the padio chair I said to her "I really wish you hadn't done that". She knew I was upset but still looked at me with bewilderment. I told her how inappropriate her actions were. I spoke about the trouble it would cause with them. Yes, I understand they're both men now and can absorb the variety of pitfalls life will throw at them. Regardless showing up and trying to act like not much has changed is just wrong. Numerous times I said all actions have consequences and her were no different. She attempted to try telling me they were her sons as well but I stopped her and reminded her that the three of us are a package deal. Cut me out and you cut them out as well. To contrast she has a son (currently 25) from her first marriage that she never really made me and my sons part of. I let her know the hypocrisy of it and the trouble it caused. I asked her what she wanted out of life for herself, for me and for us or what we were. She had no answer and just looked at me blankly. Mixed families are difficult at the best of times and all manner of integration should be attempted. It's unfortunate it wasn't. I hear her son is a half decent person albeit somewhat cold. Regardless both of my sons have seen the pain I've endured over the months and really years of our relationship the hypocrisys in it and downfall of it. Ignorance is bliss and that's the look I got from her. Truthful? Who knows? Who cares?      For the most part I was able to keep my composure. For the most part... I did raise my voice a bit and I'm sure she could see the anger and frustration in my eyes. I'm far from being a violent man and lucky for the world that I'm not. At 50 years old I'm a shadow of what I once was physically but there's still a good amount there. I walked away after a few minutes of me letting her know just how I felt about everything saying I needed to cool off. I came back and sat down in front of her moments later and said "OK I'm done". I was calm. She said she had a blast for me too. I said "let's hear it" but she declined saying she wasn't ready. I doubt she was being truthful on it. Not to boast and I'm sure it's people just trying to help me fee better but I've herd many times over the last several months that she was lucky to have me and all thst i did for her. I know I'm not without my flaws and faults but perception is everything. She apologized for how things happened and we began talking again.      Years ago she wanted to vist a naturopath. She felt it would be helpful for a variety of reasons. I always supported her but for one reason after another it didn't happen. She finally did a month after she left. She opened up a bit about her experience and what was discovered. She tells me the bacteria in her stomach is far from normal. I asked her what that meant and she told me it can cause inflammation in many different ways. It can cause various types of aches and pains. And that it can effect brain chemistry and mental health as well. I have no idea if there's any truth to what she told me. It sounded more like a justification for her actions than anything  but I don't know. She didn't show me any literature on it or even give me a technical term to research. Regardless, if there's any truth to it, it would explain a great deal of the chaos that has been building over the last few years. I asked her what can be done and she told me she's taking supplements to try and correct it.      As we talked she noticed the garden I built years ago. It was beginning to bloom. She got up and began pulling weeds and talked about what each plant was and what it would do. She thanked me for building it for her and the enjoyment it gave to her and I both. This went on for a while. It almost seemed like old times. After some time I stopped her and said that maybe it was time she got what she came for and that maybe later we could meet and talk more. She said it felt surreal being here. She also said that she wasn't ready to work on us yet. "Yet". That caught my attention. But really, after everything what makes her think that's what I want? Relationships involve two people. Not just one wanting. I believe I did more than my fair share of it. She says to me "you know I have beliefs and maybe the chapter we had is the end of a really great story". I agreed and we both went in the house.      Within a half hour she had gathered what she came for. It wasn't much. She noticed how I had mostly removed her from most of the house. It wasn't an easy task for me and I know it hurt her to see it but what am I to do? I/we can't put our lives on hold. She said goodbye to the boys and I walked her back out to her dad's car. I said "see you in a few hours". She nodded an OK, got in the car and drove off.      She messaged me about a half hour later canceling. I expected as much and responded with an "OK". She thanked me for the time today. I didn't respond.      I have no idea what to think anymore. I crave peace.</Content></post><post><Title>Is it hard for someone who is asexual to find true love?</Title><Author>u/devinliudashuaige</Author><Content>I've lost two partners because of my low sex drive. They both said they could accept it at first, but eventually realized they couldn't.      It's been a tough journey trying to navigate relationships while being asexual. When I first met my exes, everything seemed perfect. We connected on so many levels‚Äîshared interests, deep conversations, mutual respect. They assured me that my lack of sexual interest wasn't a problem. I believed them and thought I had finally found someone who truly understood me.      However, as time went on, the cracks started to show. Intimacy became a recurring issue. Despite their initial acceptance, they started expressing frustration. They felt neglected and unfulfilled, and no matter how much I tried to compensate in other areas, it wasn't enough. The emotional strain became too much to bear, leading to painful breakups.      This pattern has made me question whether true love is possible for someone like me. Society places a high value on sexual compatibility, and it often feels like a relationship can't thrive without it. This makes it incredibly difficult for asexual people to find partners who can genuinely accept and embrace their orientation.      I‚Äôve tried to educate my partners about asexuality, hoping to bridge the gap. There are moments of understanding and empathy, but when reality sets in, the physical aspect of the relationship overshadows everything else. It‚Äôs disheartening because I believe love should be more than just physical attraction. It should be about emotional connection, support, and companionship.      Recently, I've been exploring communities where asexuality is better understood and accepted. Meeting people who share similar experiences has been enlightening and comforting. It's a reminder that I'm not alone and that there are people out there who value the same things I do in a relationship.</Content></post><post><Title>A goodbye summer letter for my ex boyfriend who i still love</Title><Author>u/Adorable-Menu7301</Author><Content>Me and my ex broke up but I still love him and I'm getting better.

I never really asked my friends and family about this and kinda curious, so i decided to hear what the internet has to say about it.      A little bit of introduction, I've been single my whole life. Over the years i fell in love with some girls but never had much luck. I put much effort into it, tried to get myself to look better, i tried to make them as happy as possible. But usually some guys that they met at work or have easier access to talk to them regularly snatched them away with ease. It keeps happening ever since i was 14 when i fell in love for the first time until today (i'm 31 now).      Thx for taking your time to read, feel free to leave a comment if you feel like it.

Smiling at you. Your smile. Us watching our fav series in my car because outside was too cold for you.      The first time we met was at the cinema. Both looked for the other's hand despite having never met before. It's destiny, we kept saying.      We were happy. There were so many hardships, but I was always thinking of your happiness. After years, I was able to find a job. One that would let me take you away from a toxic environment. Finally I could pay you back for your support.      But I was blind. I couldn't notice you getting colder and colder as your darkness grew. All the bad things that happened to you turned you into one of the toxic people you wanted to free yourself from.      You got to know another guy. First, it was us three. He was my friend after all. But then my presence meant nothing to you. You started talking about him when we were alone. And I finally knew it was over. You said he was a brother to you. Yet... it happened.      And you told me you loved both of us. I told you to choose, knowing what would happen. You told me you can't choose. So I went away by myself. And you didn't even feel remorse. There was no hesitation. You didn't even try to get me back but you still claimed to love me.      I wonder, how could you erase me so easily while I'm still here, thinking of videocalling you when something funny happens?      I'm so hurt that I hate you deeply now. I hope you'll feel regret one day. I'm afraid of my new thoughts. I never yelled, I never got mad. I would hug you when you cried. I used to fight against your parents.      I remember the birthday surprises. I remember how we used to play together. I remember getting you Pok√©mon card packs whenever I'd come back from work. I remember the time you watched an old movie from my childhood with me. I remember you thanking me for giving you back your lost childhood by buying you videogames.      Where has it all gone? What did I ever do to you? Even you said "Oh I thought we were fine". You didn't even tell me. Why did you have to go?      We used to talk about our future, now we don't even exist to each other. I don't have your number anymore because it really hurt to have. I would be afraid of seeing you with him in your pfp. I'm afraid of seeing you with him on the road. In our last call, you told me you only care about the present now. And it broke me.      I hate you now, but that sweet illusion was everything to me. Every photo I delete is a tear I shed.</Content></post><post><Title>What's Worse? Is he cheating or are you self sabotaging?</Title><Author>u/Medium-Combination44</Author><Content>Is it worse to push someone away who truly loves and cares for you and wouldn't hurt you because your betrayal trauma is so deep you can't accept that someone actually wants to love you? Or would you rather convince yourself they're a horrible person and self sabotage a beautiful gift from the universe? Personally I think it's worse to wake up and realize that the person you've been accusing of cheating and not truly loving you, actually does truly love and care for you and would never hurt or betray you and the entire relationship you've been unknowingly emotionally abusing them because you've been betrayed in the past and your fear of being betrayed is hurting someone with a beautiful heart. And there's nothing worse then a loyal person who desires loyalty back, to ruin the very thing they hope for and also unintentionally hurt a beautiful person with good intentions.</Content></post><post><Title>I would like to have some strength to hold on</Title><Author>u/Inevitable-Face6615</Author><Content>If you have any questions go ahead in the comments.      I am currently trying my best to get back the love of my life. We were together for little least than 4 years. I love her a lot. We broke up 6 months ago due to us not knowing how to resolve fights. I think I have done a lot of reflecting on us and have realised how she has dealt with and acknowledged me while I haven‚Äôt noticed that in the relationship.      The last 2 weeks I talked with her a lot how serious I am about the whole situation, and that I am of course fighting for us because I know deep down we are meant to be.      During the breakup a lot has happened and I wasn‚Äôt the most supportive to her. I wasn‚Äôt mean but just not there for her.      During the 2 weeks we have spoken a lot but she said she hasn‚Äôt done the reflecting because she buried everything inside of her and has trouble feeling big feelings and she is very very confused on what she wants. I know she has to fight her demons that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm understanding. But she said right now she just isn‚Äôt ready and is super sorry that she can‚Äôt give me an answer. But at the end she said this doesn‚Äôt feel like a good bye. Then I said well then maybe it‚Äôs just a see you later.      She dropped me off at her train station and we both gave eachother a pinky promise that if she ever has made up her mind she has to give me a call. Doesn‚Äôt matter when and where. And she made me promise of I wait for her but end up finding a girl I should take my shot of happiness (movie reference) and take the girl.      I told her that I promised to fight for her as she did for me in the beginning of the relationship so I will wait.      Now recently I‚Äôm fighting with myself for how long I should wait and fight for her because if I wait half a year and then she doesn‚Äôt come, I have wasted so much time. On the other hand we are so young (22) that if she is the love of my life I‚Äôll wait a year it‚Äôs not the end of the world.      Please please ask away or tell me some encouraging experience.  What I don‚Äôt want to hear is to ‚Äûmove on and grow a pair‚Äú if it‚Äôs something constructive or helpful I‚Äôm open to everything. I just want her back.</Content></post><post><Title>Do I consider a relationship with my ex again when his whole family is too involved?</Title><Author>u/littletwinklepink</Author><Content>So my ex 28M and I 28F were together for 3 years before I had ended it. I truly never believe I will love anyone like that again, our connection is very strong and it was from the beginning. The issue was I have a very non-traditional background and he came from Persian culture. He had been very sheltered growing up and he had a big fear of his parents. It felt like we were walking on eggshells from the beginning. On top of that the judgment and pressure I felt from his family caused me to develop depression and anxiety. I knew he never had strong relationships outside his family before and it was just me. it felt like we were always putting out fires and by the time it got to us it seemed like we didn't want to talk about anything we were dealing with ourselves.      The situation got messier when I went to go live with one of his family members when I started college. His dad's cousin, who lived really close to my school, formed a strong relationship with me and she is now involved in the relationship as well. We are Ex's and friends but she does not approve and says I should cut all ties with his family because his parents will never allow peace. His dad called her and told her to kick me out to which she said she can't be told what to do. I had coffee with him after 6 months of not seeing each other and his mom blew up and locked him out of the house. He has taken a big step in demanding respect for his decisions as an adult and he has defended me time after time but they do not respect his boundaries. I do not want to be the one to tell him to cut them off because it will seem like it comes out of a place of animosity from me but realistically I do not think they will understand anything else if he has already done this much. At the moment he is basically a pariah in his home but he says he won't ignore me again and he does not want to live like he did before and he doesn't care he will deal with it. His cousin told me to block him and now I am upset more people are involved.      On top of that nobody in my life likes him because they saw the toll it took on me to deal with his families judgement and him trying to navigate and keep everyone happy for so long. I don't want to abandon him, he is more alone than ever now but I do not know if we are compatible because of the difference in dynamics we were raised in. It is really hard to not be with him but it is also so much nicer in my life when I felt free of his families pressures. we haven't been together for about a year now. Has anyone dealt with anything similar?</Content></post><post><Title>Went on this thread to ask if any of you all married your first love?</Title><Author>u/Jet_Golden</Author><Content>Have any of ya'll married your first love?

I want to have someone in my life i can open up to, someone that will not judge me, someone that could somehow love me, but i reject this idea at the same time. I dont really know how to describe it with words, but i was alone for so long, in every ways, that i cant connect with anyone. My life feels so empty that even if i try, i dont even know how to present myself to someone, or share anything about me or my life : there is nothing to share. I want to connect with people again, but i feel like it s gonna be a 1 way experience were i learn someone else, and this someone else will get nothing from me in return. I m not ugly, i m not stupid by any mean, but i very much lack the emotional capacity of a "regular" personn. No emotions on my face, never talks unless spoken to, so never talk, no projects for the future, no hobbies, no friends, never goes out,... Etc. For me, living is waiting to die later at this point. How do i get out of this mess ? How do i connect with people ? How do i make friends again ? I guess i just want at least one person to think or care about me, to feel less invisible. I just want someone to remind me that i exist too. I just want someone to speak to and laugh with. I just want someone, anyone.</Content></post><post><Title>Anyone with very atypical love stories? "Doubts-they were the one" // "they are the one-breakup"?</Title><Author>u/Kat_Dalf2719</Author><Content>Basically the title.      Nowadays the only love stories that seem to work are the ones they sell in movies and romance books where at first there is a strong spark, a click and a "we are just made for each other" feeling that lasts for life.      Out of curiosity I wanted to know if someone has love stories that deviate from these stereotypes. I'm not saying they are bad, far from the truth! They are very appealing and I have experienced those feelings in the past.      I'm thinking maybe about finding out that someone you felt doubts with turned out to be "the one" for you after time, experiences and working together. Or reversed: someone you felt this instant click and connection with, thought that you were going to get married since minute 1, turned out to be a complete disaster and thought "how could I feel this way".</Content></post><post><Title>Needing hope about finding love again after ending a 4 year relationship</Title><Author>u/eventures12</Author><Content>I (26F) ended a four year relationship with my ex boyfriend because it began to get toxic and emotionally abusive.

I have unresolved childhood trauma that I‚Äôve been working through with a therapist before I met him, and was while we dated. I‚Äôm still with the same therapist now just working all of this out.      It hurts because I seriously thought this person was the person I was going to marry. It doesn‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôm going to find a love that will be better. I know the love won‚Äôt be the exact same, but still. I just can‚Äôt imagine finding love again. I feel like I‚Äôll be so scared and hypervigilant about waiting for the other shoe to drop, like maybe it‚Äôll be the same thing all over again with someone else and no one will ever see me for who I truly am and what I deserve. I‚Äôm the type of person who loves really hard, but my ex bf wasn‚Äôt doing his work and refused to accept the internal work he needed to be doing (getting over his own childhood traumas as well).      We shared a cat together and I don‚Äôt have the him anymore which sucks. My partner bought it for me, but I wasn‚Äôt going to take it away from him since it‚Äôs technically his. I miss my cat a lot. üò≠      Just looking for some hope and wondering if anyone found their person after being in a bad/unhealthy relationship.</Content></post><post><Title>I'm starting to have severe doubts I'll ever be worthy of love</Title><Author>u/HypocrisyNation</Author><Content>This will be buried and i'm not sure if this is relevant to the sub but honestly I need to actually get this off my chest because I can't anymore.      I'm so done with dating or even considering the fact that I will ever be in a healthy long-term relationship. I am in my early 20s and my dating expriences have been horrible. From my 3 partners 2 cheated on me, one of whom was apparently with so many people "only she knows how many for sure" (words of a mutual friend), the other was just a very unhealthy relationship.I recognise that I have not been the perfect partner and have flaws that I am working on/have worked on. I try and refuse to believe that I am fundamentally broken and unworthy of love.      It is so hard though. Modern dating is just awful. Tried dating apps and it was just depressing with the constant swiping and the ones who do match would just ignore any messages I would send. Since my relationships I've been on dates and just nothing works. I've tried every approach, whether it's the "just let it come to you and work on yourself" to just trying to completely change my personality in order for someone to just actually like me romantically. Nothing changes.      I am starting to believe that there is something fundamentally wrong with me. That there is a part of my soul that is repulsive, that I am a toxin that repels everything I touch and corrodes the things I do hold unto. I don't know what it is, I'd like to think I'm quite social and have a fair amount of friends, whether male or female and I'm told by others that I am outgoing. I'm just an embarrassment it seems.      I had been talking to a girl who's interested in the same things I am and showed an interest of me in the past. I said yesterday I was going to be in her town (which I am) and I'd love to hear more about her over dinner or drinks and she simply hasn't responded for a day so now I'm just blocking her on everything, because I don't want to burden her with the task of rejecting me politely or making her awkward/uncomfortable.      People may read this and say that im being negative. I don't think it's down to looks at all, I think there is something deep in my soul that makes me unworthy of  love on a fundamental level. I actually believe that when cheating on me or turning me down that these women are making the rational desicion, and I can't help that.      I want to be loved because to me it is a justification for my existence on this earth, it is an approval of all of me, not just one part of me or just my personality or just my looks. I want someone to look at all of me and think "yes, I love every bit of him".      What can i do to become something worth loving? How do i become inherently lovable? I just want to buy someone flowers man, I feel like I have so much love to give and I just want to be able to project it.</Content></post><post><Title>Hi. This is my first post, and I wonder if I just found my soulmate.</Title><Author>u/Polaricedragon</Author><Content>I was going through my lowest point in life, and everything just kept getting worse little by little. I've been slowly climbing out of the hole, and I thought that I should try to date since I had nothing to lose. So I did, and met this girl on Facebook. She's amazing, and we went to a Caf√© for some coffee together as a first date. We instantly hit it off with sharing some stories, and getting to know each other for over 3 hours straight.      After that we exanged numbers, and kept talking to each other for about over a week. My feelings for her slowly grew until she texted on how I was very kind, and respectful, and she called me a angel. So I confessed. After a bit, she confessed back, and we instantly planned to meet again the next day. I felt very nervous, and shaky during our second date, and I asked for a hug. She accepted, and gave me a hug, and then she gave me my first kiss. Telling me that she'll always be there, and that she truly loves me. We then talked more about each other for another couple of hours till we departed once again.      Now we text each other on how we already miss each other, and that we want to be together forever. Meeting about 2 or 3 times a month, and taking it slow from here. Not wanting to get to..... that point of intimacy until she's ready, and more comfortable with the idea. I agreed, and we already have another date planned, and I can't wait to see her again.</Content></post><post><Title>I‚Äôm really struggling and I don‚Äôt know what the heck to do.

I know she loves me, and I know she wants to be with me, but she doesn't show it cause of her severe medication side-effect depression. She's always feeling down, and I don't know what to do because I physically can't cheer her up. I'm also super down too, because of my mental health related depression, and I feel like all we're able to talk about is the depressing stuff. I feel like all we're able to feel is sadness, and I hate it, because I know that even though we both want this to work, it won't if this is all we can do. I need help. I really need help here, because she's the first one who hasn't used me, who hasn't lied to me, who hasn't been a bad choice. I really don't want to lose her, because when we weren't depressed, we were perfect together.

I‚Äôm 21F and it makes me really sad, I cry about it quite often.      Im attractive, that isn‚Äôt the issue. I think my issue is that I don‚Äôt believe it can happen for me so I self reject myself before it can happen. I also feel like why should I waste someone‚Äôs time if I think it won‚Äôt be the one? But I guess it doesn‚Äôt work this way.      This past year, I couldn‚Äôt feel my emotions properly and I had become this unemotional zombie. I couldn‚Äôt even cry despite being a frequent crier. I couldn‚Äôt recognise myself but I had just came to the conclusion that life is all about making money and not relying on anyone because love isn‚Äôt real.      Id describe this as similar to losing faith in God if you‚Äôre religious. It‚Äôs very hard to come back to it once you‚Äôve burnt the mental bridge.      Recently, I‚Äôve started to feel again and I have been crying at reels related to love. There was one where this man was feeding a doll because that was his way of coping with his wife‚Äôs death. I felt the pain so hard.      What can I do to believe that there is love out there for me?</Content></post><post><Title>Spending so much time together and not feeling like I'm asking for too much.</Title><Author>u/TheAmazingAriachnid</Author><Content>My boyfriend and I have had a week long trip planned for Saturday the 8th through Saturday the 15th.

This, on top of spending an extra day with me already this week.      I am always amazed at how happy he is to spend so much time with me, and it's not anything I have to ask for.

He takes me everywhere for all our plans, takes most financial burden (nothing big but basics like taking care of meals, fuel, other random expenses) , is great at sex, is an amazing emotional support. However i feel like i don't do enough on my end. He is very supportive and patient but is getting disturbed by the entire dynamic of this relationship. I'm afraid he'll realize he is not getting anything out of this and break up with me. What can i do to show him i love him and take actual steps that show him i love him just as much as he does me. please help      Edit: Alot of comments mention things that are supposed to be there in a relationship like compliment him, be supportive, physical affection, make meals, go do his fav activity, participate in his hobbies, do laundry etc. The thing is we already do those things together. We're a great team,  love each other a lot, spend as much time with each as we can, participate in activities, hangout with each other's friends. but we do this things together. He earns twice as me so financially he takes cares of more things but even in that case its a 60-40 division. I'm specifically talking about what i can do FOR him , not WITH him that makes him feel special because everything we do together he excels at while i feel like I'm not.      i have gotten great suggestions in the comments, and i also know everyone person is different and i need to ask him this question but just adding the edit for new people who may be able to share any wisdom and pointers based on personal experience.</Content></post><post><Title>She tells me hard things, and it makes me feel more loved.</Title><Author>u/dark_and_scary</Author><Content>We had a tough conversation the other night. About behaviors and such that we don‚Äôt enjoy seeing in each other or receiving from each other. She expressed things that she knows I am sensitive about, and I would take personally (for the best).      She assumed I was upset with her and didn‚Äôt love her anymore. I told her that I love her more than ever, and have never felt more loved in my entire life.      She takes the time and effort to better our relationship and involve me in that. Before things can‚Äôt get better, we talk, and we figure it out, so that things won‚Äôt get any worse (behavior wise).

Now I can see that everything I've ever done has led me to him, and that we were meant to be together.      I realize the songs I've listened to, the poems I've collected, the things I've made, those were about him all along. He was the art piece I was looking for, the missing puzzle piece, my other half. He's the sweetest man I've ever known, he has the prettiest eyes I've ever seen and I've never loved anyone this way before.      He's a beautiful miracle, a proof that the universe can create the most wonderful things when it wants to, a sign that everything is and will be okay. He's an angel hidden behind the cutest face I've ever seen, soft hands and chapped lips.      I know I want to stay by his side unconditionally, regardless of anything else. I've known no greater comfort than the space between his arms. I know he will take care of me as he always does, and I will take care of him in the best way I can.      He makes me make art again, I find myself constantly thinking of little gifts I could craft him, and he's in my thoughts at every moment, in every decision I take.      I didn't even know it and it was him all along.</Content></post><post><Title>i finally have the loved i deserve and i feel so blessed</Title><Author>u/brunodsk8</Author><Content>In the 10 years of my adult life so far, I always struggled to find romantic love. I was always stuck in situationships or settled for men I didn't 100% like because I didn't know any better. I went on dating apps for validation when I truly just wanted to be loved.      Last year, I met my now boyfriend at work. I've known about him for a few months since my coworkers always said they knew a man my age who is single. Anyway, we ended up going on many dates &amp;amp; he asked me to be his girlfriend one day.      Fast forward to a year and 3 months later, we are still going on strong. I have experienced so much trauma from my past dating experiences that I didn't think I was worth being loved romantically. My boyfriend, however, shows me everyday that I deserve so much love and more. For example, when we have arguments, I would be scared we will breakup soon (based on past experiences), but my boyfriend would always tell me that it is NEVER me vs. him &amp;amp; that it is us vs. the problem. Another example would be whenever I have a panic attack, he would help me take deep breaths, hold my hand, and tell me that it will be okay and that he won't leave my side. My past has always made me feel like I am difficult to love. But he always shows me that I am easy to love after all.      We are now talking about our future like marriage, house, etc. It is nice to date someone with similar values and goals as me. I feel very lucky and blessed. I still feel sad that my past self went through so much bad experiences with guys all because I wanted to be loved. Now that I am with my current boyfriend, I feel so whole- like I could do anything in the world as long as he is by my side. I cannot wait to marry him.</Content></post><post><Title>What things can a guy do to actually find a date?</Title><Author>Unknown author</Author><Content>28m here, I've tried tons of things to get into dating since my last relationship. Its been an uphill battle where I would say I've had 1 actual date in the last year. Its rough out there. I'll list what I've done just to paint a clear picture.      Things I do by myself: workout 5 times a week, Rollerblade, read books (sometimes at a bar), video games, board games, glove, TV and anime, cook, hangout with my cat, raves/clubs/festivals, and going out with friends.      Things I've done to date: online dating (haven't done it in 6 months, terrible for my mental health), tried in the gym, at a ren faire, in public by the beach, grocery store, bars, clubs/raves, and speed dating.      As a guy in my late 20s, I've found it incredibly difficult to meet anyone. Any girls I've talked to are all talking to multiple people or got serious with someone other than me. I also don't think I am appearing desperate either, I'm just myself and if I think a girl is cute and I have something to say then I'll say it and walk away. I won't always ask for a number because I understand that guy's harass girls a lot and they receive a lot of unwanted attention. I'm just at a loss for what to do.      What have you done to meet people? What things can I do that I haven't done yet? I've begun losing hope that I'll ever meet someone and I also don't just want to hop into a relationship with the first girl that shows any interest. I want it to be an actually good fit.</Content></post><post><Title>Sisterly Love - Hugging ON SALE TODAY NewForest3D on Etsy. https://newforest3d.etsy.com/listing/1034408454</Title><Author>u/mrSiruk</Author><Content>No content</Content></post><post><Title>What Are The Little Things Your Partner Does That Mean The World To You?</Title><Author>u/RadioEngineerMonkey</Author><Content>I've seen a lot of posts about larger romantic gestures and I feel like, while nice, the little things done a million times over the course of a relationship are far more telling of love and appreciation between partners. So I wanna know what the little things that still make your heart flutter are. I'll go first because I love praising my wife, heh.      If she's awake when I get in bed (or wakes up as I do), she will always flip over and give me a hug or kiss before going back to sleep      She knows I have trouble getting back to sleep after waking up, so she tends to get up and take care of the dogs' morning out and breakfast.      She always brings me a drink or snack when she has to go somewhere while I'm working.      My biggest cheerleader, congratulations made each class I finished or project I work.      Encourages me to go have a friend night or outing because she sees I need some solo time.      Always comes to me with ideas for us to go do together.      Gives me little thoughtful gifts or makes me art pieces.      Last week I had a long tiring week doing travel work. She picked me up at the airport per normal, but instead of meeting me outside, met me at the escalator with flowers and a soda. Not something I had ever asked for, but no one has ever bought me flowers in my life and I almost cried on the spot just because this small gesture was her showing how proud of me she was for the work I do.      And there are millions more, but I feel like this is long enough already. So for all you folks out there, what are the little things your partner does that still make you realize how loved you are, even months/years/decades into the relationship?</Content></post><post><Title>Bf sometimes messages me a lot other times can go days without messaging me I‚Äôm so confused</Title><Author>u/Miu_Cat</Author><Content>So my (18F) bf (18M) have been dating around 3 months and he was super sweet before and I always felt like he put in the same effort I did and we messaged consistently during school. In summary 2 weeks ago he had some stress in his life and grew much more distanced and only told me why after + apologized. Thought things were back to normal then he messaged me smth about feeling bad I put too much time and effort into him, more than he did, with not enough for other areas of my life so I told him I‚Äôll work on better balancing my time.      Summer rolls around with school being out and I give him some space and message him less then he suddenly started telling me good morning first again (usually I sent it first) sent me a bunch of reels (albeit mostly freaky/suggestive ones) so I thought things were back to normal and messaged him more. He asked to hang out 2x and things seemed great. Then right after our 2nd hang out he didn‚Äôt respond to my good morning message/messages for a whole day and for the past 3 days has barely sent me like 1 reel a day. So I backed off and don‚Äôt really message him anything. I‚Äôm trying not to let this bother me but idk what‚Äôs going on if he‚Äôs busy, hanging out with other people, working or what. I wish he‚Äôd tell me if he didn‚Äôt feel like talking or wtv. Is this normal for teenage dudes or what cause this keeps happening üò≠.      Last night finally mustered up the courage to message checking in if he‚Äôs alright. He said yeah just busy with work and all. I can‚Äôt help but feel that‚Äôs not all to it cause when he was messaging me a lot the days before it was while he was at work + I saw him online playing games during his usual work times (he‚Äôs been a part-timer) so unless he changed his work hours in the summer idk. I‚Äôm not sure what to do, do I wait for him to reach out? Do I reach out again? Do I leave it or prod him to share his honest feelings?</Content></post><post><Title>I‚Äôm in my first relationship, and the love is so special but weird</Title><Author>u/gohn-gohn</Author><Content>This is kinda ranty, so apologies if it‚Äôs not coherent.

I don‚Äôt want to treat her like some secret I have to keep, but at the same time I like the privacy of not talking about my relationship, like it‚Äôs my own thing between me and her.      Maybe it‚Äôs a symptom of growing up, but I almost can‚Äôt believe it. It all happened so fast and so slow at the same time, going from never dating anyone to having a girlfriend I want to marry. I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm naive or lucky or what but I can‚Äôt imagine being in love with anyone else. And now I‚Äôm starting to slowly meet her family, and that too is such a weird experience. There‚Äôs this whole other group of people who are related to each other, and I feel like such an outsider. Not in a bad way, just in a realistic way.

He just got surgery and was upset of a lot of limitations.      Whenever he needs comforting, i don't know why but he always goes to me and that is frequently like every 3 days or so. He also updates me of the status of his sickness even if I do not ask sometimes. I did not ask because I got upset of his accident but he still sent me a message asking me to support him allthroughout the surgery and for me to check on him before and after surgery which I did.      I gave much emotional support before and after that I felt exhausted before. What I notice is he's really dependent on me emotionally and since he's attached to me, he seems to have the need to check on me and to send me sometimes some youtube links to help me with my sickness as well.      I don't know how to call it but we are very close but with strong emotional intimacy as we are sweet when sending messages to each other.

I found a "ManBat" while thrifting action figure, a batman villain and she wouldn't stop talking about how happy she was I found it, and then when I was on a video call with my buddy she couldn't help but show off my find.

I heard him say "hold on one sec" and I immediately knew he was coming in to say goodnight to me. He walked in and said "I need a better goodnight than that" and kissed me on the lips. I just smiled and thought to myself, and this is why I'm marrying him :)</Content></post><post><Title>Partner using me for money &amp;amp; sex? Or keep trying to win back</Title><Author>u/supremejesusx</Author><Content>Abandon my partner ? or stay      Very long story short: Dating for almost 2 years. Moved in way too fast. Were never able to properly communicate and resolve fights so they became bigger and (for my part) i said mean things.      I wanted to leave a few times, didn't. She left me one day but left her items. Came back after me writing love letters and flowers,etc. We didnt talk properly, fought once again and again without talking she left with everything while i was at work.      After a month of NC (mostly) and me paying a few thousands in remaining bills so she could feel safety and have less worries, i suprised her with an airbnb near a beach about an hour away from her hometown. Gave her a book with all our memories and my thoughts that ive been journaling about her, some fancy clothes as she always liked me to take the lead. And did some beautiful bars/restaueants. We had an amazing time! Just like we were in love all over again.      Started slowly rebuilding and videocalling everyday, saying i love you,etc but she didnt want any labels or gave almost no reassurance even when i openly communicated about it. I got anxious, suffered alot. One day she was extremely sweet, the other ..things were off and i almost didnt exist to her.      In the meanwhile we planned another holiday (last week).      A week before the holiday she suddenly said that its unfair what she has been doing and doesnt want a relationship right now. ( at the same time i know 100% sure she does and wants to have kids soon too)      A bit after she tried to convince me it was a bad idea to do the holiday. Everything was already paid for and now it was a day before the holiday.      It was very very stressful to me but i couldnt cancel so i told her. We went.. it was amazing.. almost dreamlike and cared for each other.      A while ago i bought a ring and prepared some text to tell her on the holiday. As i didnt say the text finally but explained i did this and why. Also that i really still wanted this and am doing my best to show up and apologise / grow together. (The ring was supposed to be a promise ring) She doesn't seem to be able to give a definitive answer.      i really want to respect her space and understand but somewhere also think if you want something or love someone, no matter how hard it was. At least you're clear or try in some way after all this? Even after suffering or this long i'm still trying to fight for it and it feels a bit like it means nothing to her.      She was and is very kind and loving. But i'm just quite scared to be on the emotional rollercoaster i was on again.      Do i ask her again what she wants to do? As i don't want to force her but also by now 3-4 months have past and i've been trying to show consistent love and growth,two holidays, gifts and care.We live in a different country now which doesn't make it easier.      I feel way less anxious than i did at some points. But don't want to be waiting for months with hearts in my eyes for a message that says: "i dont love you anymore"      What do i do ?      TL:DR Couple of 2 years, started to not resolve fights and said very wrong things. She moved out. Been trying to win her back giving her space , two holidays, nice gifts, daily compliments and care. She stays vague and i dont know what to do as i feel less anxious, want to fight but also want clarity in a way. Mostly dont want to pressure her. What do i do.</Content></post><post><Title>Can I brag about my boyfriend on here??

And the only difference to this one was I actually with a love of mine on this day. My motorcycle. Sitting at a stop light with Her, behind me.      Paying attention to anyone behind me when the bike and I were in motion isn't generally where my focus lies but of course, I am always attentive whenever we approach a stop. As you expect, cars came careening towards my bike and I to form a orderly queue into the cute little outdoor mall we were all head towards. Carelessly glancing at my mirrors, I noticed a little SUV behind me slowing to a halt. All I really noticed was hair and vague faces as my brief attention is more focused on whether they were going kill me or not and not then not trying to overtly stare at them like a creep. They stop, and I figure I throw myself into my favorite new habit as an official new member of the 'owner of a motorcycle club' by waving at all the motorcycles as the pass me by, sometimes just flinging my arms like a disconnected npc only tethered by a pure soul. Through the frequency of life flowing through me that day, I felt it radiated through connecting me to my immediate surroundings. I felt as if everything within sight of me was in tune with my being so to say. Kinda felt like whatever decision I made next, could do no wrong. So, I decided to turn around and wave. While I was signaling other bikers, I had noticed that the heads of hair behind me had faces... lovely faces too, that were smiling. Its always nice to see smiles but It's never fun to assume there they're ever on the same vibe as you. You see, there's a certain level of composure I like to believe I still possess that is only confirmed when exercised....So what was the reaction of my kind wave? 2 waves back, with more nice smiles. Helmet on, visor up I bet anyone could see my dumbass grinning from ear to ear. Pretty great feeling that I wasn't expecting but I figured it happened, because I waited for a sign or signal.      So I doubled down and figured, hey if were both going to the mall, we should probably eat something, preferably.. TOGETHER! As we turn Into the lot, I yell*yes in a motorcycle helmet* Are yalling eating? But they didn't hear or it fell on uninterested ears. No worries.They kept driving ahead a little and I decided to park my bike to this really cool black bike the almost engulfed my entire attention span in that moment. As I was getting my footing to scoot myself into the spot, I noticed they had only got about 4 cars in front of me and decided to park.      Hmmmm... I thought to myself. First I didn't want to look back and I only did, because of a feeling or a sign... is parking this close a sign I should pay attention to? Well, if so, they hazard right? Why wont they.. *blinkblink blinkblink* ...........The hazards flashNow I thinking, Well who the hell am I to question life? And I rev'd over. I don't remember what I said but It must have not been that awful because I then got invited to go shop for anklets by 2 laid back beautiful, happy women. My heart dropped... How did they know? That I actually loved shopping for anklets on memorial day exclusively?!      We take a short walk and talk a talk and walk while exchanging names, and the story unravels from their side.They pulled up behind me and thought it was funny that I was waving at all the motorcyclists and from my visor being up, thought I was cute.*yo no se*Hearing this played back to me was funny and I tried not to look too deep into it at the moment because I was in it and felt there was more to it all if I just, existed in the moment. And this point I felt enough pleasantries had been exchanged and surface level reconnaissance to see if we were cool had concluded. Now was the time to lean into one of them with a more purposely directed level of romantic attention. I lightly asked what their availability for love looked like between them and the friend said they were married but kind of signaled/explained that her friend was available. My heart said Wow my brain? Relax, Don't be weird. Continue the journey. Giving all praise to the friend.. she explains how she suggested that her friend eat after I yell/asked about it, and it was her idea to turn the hazards on to let me know to come up to them. I'm a little stunned realizing how very lucky I was for her to be the manifestation of cupid in the most clutch way possible.      Finally, we arrived at the anklet store and.............. it's close. Awh shit. Well what do you do when you and your best friend can't get matching anklets on memorial day? You initiate the best friend suicide pact aahhhhhAHHHH!!! NO, no NO NO! nonononononononono.      You... go buy an adult beverage from across the street. I mean let's be honest, any day without matching anklets so a day that has been fucked. So far as I'm concerned and if we're walking on ice, we might as well dance. Getting a little sip during the day always seems to take a little off the tip of the devils dick. So we go drink. During this time we have a great exchange of who we( me, Her, and the friend) essentially feeling out if cool or not. Throughout this though, I can't help but to feel like I'm falling for this person I'm talking to. I could really get into the fine details of it all but I feel like that is special to me. In a book, I picked up a little philosophy about keeping some things to yourself. No one needs to know all the details, ya know?And I'm breaking that rule to a degree by sharing this story only because what happened afterwards was a ghosting on a level that I can't comprehend.      Weeeee leave towards their car and I kid you not, If I did not have this girl in my hand/near me, I would have have floated the fuck off into the air. I felt that feeling again, as if I could do no wrong. So after saying goodbye to her friend, She and I hugged and I looked into her eyes. There was a future that I was felt was being welcomed to be apart of, if I didn't fumble it.I had her number, she had shown interest from a stop light... don't push it I thought... but rather.. squeeze 'it'..?      I kissed her on the cheek... and we both smiled. Not thinking, I grabbed her hand and kissed it while looking into her eyes. She was a little taken back and said, No ones ever done that, You get points for that. I smile and said.. Hell, if you're giving out points , I'm a collecting.We exchange another round of pleasantries, and we part ways.      Crossing the street and looking both ways on shaky legs made me ponder if this what deer feel like when they're caught in the headlights. Nah, they weren't as lucky as me on this day.      As I'm gearing up to ride, She comes up to me from behind and informs me that her friend told her she shouldn't leave until we have a kiss.I agreed. Her lips were ineffable. And for momentarily, they had stolen what ability I had at forming them right from my mouth.      So they left and I left the immediate area to release a little bit of energy trying to learn how to do a wheelie on my bike in this empty lot. Little bit after I got kicked I text her to at least say how great it was meeting her and her friend.      She shares the same feelings and proceeds to share with me that us meeting eachother, made her day. I remember telling her I was sorry I didn't have anything clever to say after the kiss but she and time allowed me, that I would find the words some day to express how I felt. She gave me a nickname.. I told I would do the same but it would take some time so to be as good as the one she had given me.      That was day 1. The next day, I gave a good morning and good luck today kinda text. A nice receptive and equally reflecting message in return from her. Short and sweet, Good sign I thought.Later I figured, sense the circumstances of my job don't allow me to be in one place for too long, I should try and reach out try and plan something for us to have a nice one on one before I leave town, like a dinner. I truly just wanted to know more. The pace was going well so they was no need to rush....................................................... No response for the whole day. Now, I'm a bit confused. I try not to over think it and let it be. A day passes nothing. 2? Nada.I honestly kinda didn't know what to think after having a moment like that.. I did the regular protocol. Go back and review every little detail in my head to see where I misstepped and did something wrong. I even asked an older female friend. And they couldn't help me find a fault either. Then after a few close friends give me their possible rundowns of what COULD have happen, I kinda exhaled a little bit. And kinda let it go. One friend even joked saying that maybe she died in a car wreck.... I was not laughing... atleast not immediately. I understood why they would say such a thing to a friend in that moment.      SO I decided to reel it in.... and give it one..more... cast out in the lake of... her andAs I write, I still haven't heard from her. And apart of me doesn't want to make sense out of it because it might ruin the mystique of romance. That moment is there as it was left until it reveals itself again, if it ever does.      I guess I'm sharing this because I've always believed in finding someone, out there in the flesh, while trying to make it in the world is something quite beautiful in life truly worth experiencing.      And because of that I never forget that love is always around us, waiting around the corner. Or at an intersection south of the Emerald City.</Content></post><post><Title>How to tell if our relationship is falling out? The end?</Title><Author>u/mirameowfart</Author><Content>Me and my boyfriend have been dating for 4 years now. This isn‚Äôt a honeymoon situation either because we have already been through hell and back with that. And a part of me really wishes that there was some bigger issue causing this but it‚Äôs not and it‚Äôs out of my control.      I love my partner to the moon and back. But I don‚Äôt think I ‚Äúlike‚Äù him anymore. We haven‚Äôt kissed in ages or really been that affectionate much. We haven‚Äôt made love in a while either. Part of the reason, or I guess most of it if I‚Äôm being honest is because I think I‚Äôm losing attraction to him. Of course not because of his looks or anything. But the way he acts.      It‚Äôs like he doesn‚Äôt try anymore. I know things have been hard for him in life but I feel like this isn‚Äôt an excuse anymore. He doesn‚Äôt clean after himself like ever. I have to tell him multiple times,,around 6-7 for example to pick up a dirty cup of coffee that‚Äôs been sitting on the counter or in his room for weeks. He just won‚Äôt do it. Until I pester and pester him about it. He won‚Äôt clean parts of his house and lets them get disgusting.      the past month he hasn‚Äôt had a job since he quit his last one so now there‚Äôs no excuse to let things get bad around the house. All he does is play video games for hours. Absolutely no excuse because the only things he does is go to the gym for an hour a day.      We‚Äôve had multiple conversations about things. I‚Äôll be moving in with him (I‚Äôm at his house most of the time everyday since the both of our gaming setups are right next to each other). And I cannot exaggerate when I say this, I‚Äôve probably had this conversation with him more than 30 times. About how I‚Äôm worried for our future and mine since I don‚Äôt like the way he doesn‚Äôt care for himself. It‚Äôs not that he CANT do laundry CANT wash dishes CANT clean the bathroom. He doesn‚Äôt WANT too. And I don‚Äôt get it. I genuinely cannot wrap my mind around it.      One of the last few conversations we had about this situation (btw this situation has been going on for over 6+ months and had only gotten worse) he read articles and said he really understands now and that he‚Äôll change (he always says this) and he‚Äôll clean and do everything for about 5 days and then give up and not do it again.      I‚Äôm at the point now that I don‚Äôt even want to do anything anymore. He barely compliments me or does any sweet gestures. I feel like I‚Äôm always the one to make plans and be sweet with him. But since he never does anything like this unless I ask or hint to me wanting him to do it, I just give up now. Because why am I the only one ever putting in any effort??      This is really stressful. We are in the same room for hours a day and barely even speak to each other. I‚Äôm done! But I don‚Äôt know if I want to leave. Because he‚Äôs been my everything and I can‚Äôt imagine a future without him. But also, what if this is just unhealthy for me to even be with him?? I‚Äôm very conflicted and tired.</Content></post><post><Title>I don‚Äôt really know how else to heal from my relationship, I feel lost.

Surprisingly, I haven't shed any tears over the breakup. Despite my love for him and the undeniable connection we shared, my inability to cry has left me perplexed. Throughout our relationship, I endured a great deal, which might explain my emotional response‚Äîor lack thereof. I believe that crying is a healthy part of the healing process, yet I find myself unable to do so. Is this a common experience? Has anyone coped with similar feelings?

We are both really busy people and managed to get off 2 working days and booked a 3 night stay away in the woods by a lake for quality time and a bit of digital detox. We are both really excited to spend time together without the worlds distractions. The park is really ideal and has a restaurant, padel, wellness centre, pools, kayaking and other chilled activities.      Since he has planned some really lovely dates that I know he put a lot of effort into preparing for - I would love to treat him. I think he's been overworked and over stretched recently although he won't say it. I am going to bring cards, a puzzle, painting supplies to paint each other and bringing a good wine selection. I will also bring one of those disposable cameras. Based on our time we've spent together and joining our friend groups, we do love a good wine and cheese board, talking for hours on end, laughing about nonsense and spending hours in bed.      Is there any truly good quality time activities you could suggest I prepare for?</Content></post><post><Title>Fallen in love with a Canadian man who is literally travelling to the UK next week to meet me.</Title><Author>u/Low-Most-217</Author><Content>First thing to say: he‚Äôs real, he is who he says he is, I‚Äôve seen evidence and his family and I have spoken, we video call everyday and he told me where he worked and I checked. It‚Äôs all safe.      He‚Äôs renting his own place, we are so connected and in love, he is gonna stay for a month then if it‚Äôs perfect he‚Äôs going to move. It‚Äôs been like a month. Are we crazy?      I have two kids but he has none. He is at the end of a long divorce and I have been single after a shit relationship where I was completely broken down (he was the same to begin with)      He can work anywhere in the world with his laptop so he will work from here and live in his own place while we test things out. If it doesn‚Äôt work he will go home and nothing changes.      Luckily he has the finances and the lifestyle to do this and I am so excited I could burst. I have had such a horrendous string of shit partners and the lengths this man is going to in order to just be near me gives me the confidence and reassurance to believe this could be a real thing?      We want the same things, we click on everything, I feel like we are best friends without knowing one another. It feels like he is the other half of me and he agrees. I just want this to be good so badly.

To avoid getting yelled at myself, I usually hid in my room. Anyways, I know my parents love me because they sacrifice a lot for me but I don‚Äôt really feel it.      I‚Äôve had 2 boyfriends and the first one was kinda a boyfriend but it was an online long distance relationship and after 2 weeks he broke up claiming that it wouldn‚Äôt work out. The next guy I met like 2 months later and he lives like an hour away from me and we go to different schools so I don‚Äôt get to see him often. I met up with him for our first date and then two days later for another. After those two days I never saw him face to face again. Then a couple of months passed of us talking and it going well but then out of nowhere he just stopped replying to me and I haven‚Äôt spoken to him since. Also after thinking I realized that he got with me just so that he could say that he was in a relationship. I feel like I was used and all I want is someone to truly love me but I don‚Äôt think that that it could happen.      There is some hope but after all of this I feel like maybe I‚Äôm destined to not feel loved or that for whatever reason I‚Äôm not worthy of love. I don‚Äôt want to unload this on my future partner but I have no idea how to feel like I can be loved.</Content></post><post><Title>Even though it‚Äôs for the better, it‚Äôs difficult not being able to tell u this.</Title><Author>u/j_p96</Author><Content>(Posted this in r/unsentletters but figured I‚Äôd also post here.

You know, just like the classic meme scene where the guy turns around to ogle an attractive woman passing by.      Except, I was actually looking at a Navy Blue Porsche (seriously, that car was gorgeous) while she clamped on my arm because her first thought had been that I had noticed a cool insect (which she's terrified of), not another girl.      It was heartwarming and, in hindsight, also really funny. Just wanted to share!</Content></post><post><Title>Our Summer Love - College Kids Reuniting After The End of The Semester</Title><Author>u/LowDependent2608</Author><Content>K had gone outside to the car to give us a moment alone. She understood that A was putting on a front in her presence. We hugged inside the cool shell of his living room, his arms slipping down my back to my waist. My head was in his shoulder, right where it enjoys to be because its close to his mind. ‚ÄúI missed you,‚Äù I said. I spoke from my heart, where his memory often resides. When he heard me, he hugged me closer.      ‚ÄúI missed you, too,‚Äù he said. We were chest to chest, and it was so warm. Then, he reached down and scooped me up into his arms. I was carried like a baby, or more like a bride to a honeymoon, to his bedroom door. He said ‚ÄúI‚Äôm kidnapping you.‚Äù      This was all deliciously spontaneous, as his hands were full and he had to drop me to open the door. I‚Äôll never forget the blue of his gatorade. Or the awkward moment of the door turning, me standing there. I said, ‚Äúthis is the world's worst kidnapping.‚Äù      We entered his room and it was a disaster. To his credit, it did not smell. And also there was a space cleared on his bed, which was just as soft and plush as his dorm room bed. It‚Äôs almost like it‚Äôs not whichever bed that is soft, but A himself who creates the softness with his aura.      He sat, and I commented on his room because I had no sense that this was about to be a moment. The 5pm sun was coming through the window, it was clear light that made everything seem like a reflection of clear water.      A grabbed the collar of my flannel with both hands and pulled me on top of him. I landed with a smile, pleasantly surprised. I felt overall very pleasant at that moment. I rubbed my nose against his, softly. He paused, and then returned the action, aggressively. And i giggled and pressed my lips into his, smiling all the while. The soft texture, the smell of his breath, his palm rubbing across the globes of my ass. I didn‚Äôt feel pleasant, I felt joy.      Out of every boy I have spoken too, known, or otherwise in my first year of college, none of them have hit the spot quite like A. With his honey-brown skin tone, big lips, and broad hands. The boyish quality of his voice. The spark of danger in his eye. The softness in his actions. In my kiss, I returned all the joy I receive in knowing him.      The first time I ever kissed him, the passion and fear heightened the moment to new levels of exhilaration. It was so exciting, it barely felt real.      This kiss felt more like a sweet, long anticipated reunion. And it felt more rooted in reality, as we have truly seen the best and the worst of each other by this point and still find comfort in the other's presence. Or maybe because it‚Äôs summer and everything feels a little more real, now. Or maybe it‚Äôs because I was in his real bedroom. Maybe it was a little bit of everything.      Outside of all the bullshit stress of school, peers, and our own baggage, there is a genuine bond between us.      He picked me up and dropped me on the bed, sliding between my legs and kissing me again. I suggested one of us take our glasses off after they repeatedly knocked into each other. His came off, and so did mine. He‚Äôs blinder than I am, so him taking his off was a real sacrifice. He could kiss me easier here, and I could see the lovely full shape of his eyes.      He kissed down my neck to my boob which he slipped out of top. His tongue rolled over my nipple and he grinded the fullness of his bulge into my pelvis. It fits so well. Took up the exact amount of space my vagina. I wrapped my legs around his hips and pulled him deeper into me, wanting to feel and savor this moment for all it could offer.      He paused and stood over me, his thumbs pressing firmly into the corners of my vagina, like it was a peach he wanted to pull apart and drink the juice out of. There was a small smile on his face, and his eyes scanned my body as he admired me. His shoulders rising and falling calmly.      My hands were splayed out next to my head, and I felt that tricky little fuzziness enter my brain. The fuzziness that makes it hard for me to rationalize during sex, or sexual acts. I become totally open, ready to receive and become whatever my partner wants.      I could sense the wheels turning in A's head, wondering if he should take off my flannel, how much time we have left, etc. He finally just decided to pull me up by my collar. My mouth was slightly open with a smile. I wanted whatever he wanted,      Unfortunately, we didn‚Äôt get to go any further because his mom started yelling about my sister outside. We panicked and stood up, me with my back facing the door so I could fix my titties and my flannel.      The door opened, I turned around, and now I was meeting his mom. I felt mainly fear. Her expression was one of surprise, and I have no idea what A was thinking. It was awkward, I just said, ‚ÄúHi, I‚Äôm N.‚Äù And she smiled back, the same smile as A, and gave her name.      A attempted to excuse the situation by saying we were just talking. She didn‚Äôt care for an explanation and made that clear without sounding rude. It‚Äôs vain, but I hope she thought I was beautiful. The whole moment felt beautiful enough to forgive the imperfections of my appearance. Everything was glazed over in this feeling of presence and nostalgia, now and future.      Meeting his mom doesn‚Äôt directly mean anything, but the implication will proceed after me. His family has met me, now it‚Äôs a story being told, now he has questions being thrown at him. Who is this girl to you? Nosy nieces and nephews will prod and tease confessions out of him.      Listen, I don‚Äôt know how this story is going to end. But as I walked out of his house and turned around to see him wrangling the necks of his neice and nephew, i got a sense of past and future. The past, when my only impression of the two kids were his screensaver. When i asked who they were. When he was still a code i‚Äôd yet to crack. When my heart was barely fluttering with the beginnings of what would become adoration. And to the future, where the two kids in his arms are our children. And that doorway leads into our house. Where he decides what he wants, and it‚Äôs me, and everything is okay. A future where sex isn‚Äôt dangerous, where peace is achievable, where communication is open, and where love doesn‚Äôt hurt (unless it‚Äôs consensual).      It‚Äôs just me and him, always. Mine, and his.      At the end of the day, i‚Äôm just surprised we‚Äôve come this far. But much like A, it is a pleasant surprise and one that I plan to see through to the very end, consequences and all. ‚Äî Tell me what you think!</Content></post><post><Title>What is Love Exactly..?? It's Putting Someone's Needs Before Yours.. ü¶ãüå±üíô‚ù§</Title><Author>u/Boomersatx</Author><Content>No content</Content></post><post><Title>My boyfriend will walk out in the pouring rain just to ensure I don't have to get soaked</Title><Author>u/NocturnaPhelps</Author><Content>For context: I come from a bad relationship past. If I ever got a nice gesture done for me it was because I pretty much had to insinuate I wanted it, or downright beg for it. Being treated well, and with kindness and love were not things I really got to experience in my past too much, and was one of many reasons why once my last relationship failed I swore off dating EVER again!      Fast forward many years and many more lines on my face later: I just wanted to take a second to brag briefly about two instances where my boyfriend did simple, but kind gestures of pure love for me that I didn't even have to ask for at all. Also being two instances that captured my heart and let me know there are good men and gentlemen in this world. I'll call him Chris in this story.      About 6 months ago Chris and I were out grocery shopping on a pretty dreary day, and being the forgetful person that I am, I forgot to bring the umbrella into the store with me. As we walked out, lo and behold it was a torrential downpour. Without hesitation, Chris tells me to wait there under the sheltered area of the store while he goes and picks up the car and pulls it closer. He takes the grocery cart with him, unloads all of the groceries in the pouring rain into the back of his car and then picks me up at the door so that I don't have to get soaked! üåπ      Last week he and I are getting ready to leave on a mini-getaway and, of course, it starts pouring moments before it's time for us to leave. So what does Chris do? He goes out into it and packs all of our belongings into the car and pulls it up as close to the house as he can so I don't have to walk far in it! All out of kindness. All unprompted. That's my boyfriend, and the love of my life. ‚ù§Ô∏è      Some people may look at these two moments and see nothing brag-worthy. Some people may look at these two moments with total awe. There have been countless times throughout our relationship (coming up on a year now) where I have been in total amazement, and completely grateful and have fallen in love a little bit more. Chris has done infinite loving gestures for me both big and small and I could spend a day writing about them all.      I come from a place of never wanting to date again for so long. I thought there was no one out there in this world for me who would match me in all the important ways like personality, but also treat me well on top of everything else and help me see through all of the bad shit my exes engrained into me and made me think was normal and expected. He has done all of that and more a thousand fold. I want everyone to experience this kind of love and kindness.</Content></post><post><Title>A true story about two teenagers in love in 1987</Title><Author>u/enfp-girl</Author><Content>Letter from 1987      Here‚Äôs a true story from the 80s.

His grandparents are both turning 90, they‚Äôre still fit and able but they‚Äôre fragile and the way he cares for them absolutely melts my heart.      His Nana, him and I all walked down to the harbour together and he walked in between us both, holding our hands either side of him. When we were at the harbour, his Nana sat down with her friends and chatted, my boyfriend and I bought a crab net and some bacon and we went off to catch some crabs. We got bored of crabbing after an hour, and my boyfriend saw a boy and his dad crabbing together with only one net between them, so he gave ours away to the little boy (who looked quite bored) and I just can‚Äôt with how sweet he is. On the way back, he bought his Nana an ice cream and held her hand back to the car again. He cannot do enough for his family in general. He‚Äôs constantly pouring drinks for them, carrying things for them, supporting them in anything they need. When we left the next morning, his grandparents were waving us goodbye from their doorstep and as my boyfriend drove off, he became emotional and started to cry. It so lovely to see how much he cares and loves for his family. It‚Äôs refreshing in this generation.      Another night we were there, I started to feel extremely nauseous (the night before we left home for the trip I had a very long night fighting the Norovirus) and he took such care of me and he did it in such a way that I didn‚Äôt feel like a burden at all, even though I had basically wasted a night. He just put twilight on the TV, got us a blanket and cuddled me whilst I slept off the anti nausea meds I took. We had planned to order food that night too, but he refused to order any food for himself incase the smell made my nausea even worse (crying soppy tears rn)      Anyway I learnt that he is the most caring, sensitive, sweet and thoughtful person I‚Äôll ever meet and I really can‚Äôt comprehend how lucky I am to be with him. Even acts of kindness and love from him that aren‚Äôt directed at me still make me feel so proud to call him mine. I feel like my hearts about to beat out of my chest. I learnt that he really is the one and there really is nothing about him not to like. He‚Äôs amazing</Content></post><post><Title>I don't know if this belongs here or not.

I think of you every day. You don‚Äôt just cross my mind, you‚Äôre living inside of it. It‚Äôs been a month since we last spoke, and my heart yearns for you. Any and all of you. Your smile. Your beautiful brown eyes that look like milky pots of honey. Your voice that I could listen to forever.      I‚Äôve told you about how I don‚Äôt dream much, but since our last interaction I‚Äôve dreamed of you. It was quite a funny one actually. I want to tell you about it. But even when I‚Äôm awake, I dream of you. I dream of the way your embrace would feel. The smell of your chest as I bury my head into it. The beating of your heart against mine. I yearn for your strong arms lovingly wrapped around my body, softly grazing my back while whispering sweet-nothings into my ear.      I feel silly for crying. I feel dramatic and childish. But when you know, you know, and I knew once I started talking to you that you would steal my heart. Which you have. You have stolen my heart, twisted yourself up into it, only for you to rip it out of my chest. Why am I like this? How is it possible for one person to make me feel this way?      Do you still think of me? Do I still cross your mind, and how often? Is it as often as how much you cross mine? Have you had more dreams of me since our last interaction? I want to know, baby. I want to know more than anything in the world. Did you ever like me the way I liked you? You knew from the beginning that you wouldn‚Äôt have time for a relationship, yet you got my hopes up that ‚Äúus‚Äù could be a possibility. You even told me that you think we‚Äôd pair well romantically. Yet, here we are. I feel silly for wanting to try again if we ever get the chance.      I loved the way you called me baby. I loved the way you made me feel like I wasn‚Äôt a burden. I love your kind nature and determined mind. I loved hearing your voice and laugh over the phone. I loved our hours-long phone calls.      Every day, I fantasize about what it would be like to cross paths again. I fantasize about conversations we would have. The tears we would cry together. The laughs we would share. There are so many things I want to tell you, and things I want you to tell me.      I miss you, J.

Each day is a battlefield of triggers, small moments that drag me back to memories I desperately want to forget. Now, with someone new by my side‚Äîsomeone whose presence feels like a gift I don't deserve‚ÄîI'm tormented by skepticism. She‚Äôs everything I could ever dream of, showing me, not just telling me, how much she adores me, yet my heart remains a prisoner by my own demise, scarred by every bad yesterday.      I'm exhausted from carrying this weight. Truly, for the first time, I crave to become a better man, not just for myself but because of her. Her love is a light in my darkness, a savior that calls me to rise above my fears. She makes me want to tear down these walls and step into a future where trust and happiness are possible. Her presence is a reminder that I can be more than my past, that I can heal and grow. I want to be the man she sees in me, to honor the love she gives so freely. For her, I want to leave the shadows behind and finally, truly, not just survive, but live in a world where doubt no longer tells me we‚Äôre friends.      I want to be a better man.      She makes me want to be a better man.

I was so isolated and afraid. But since leaving it‚Äôs like the blinders have come off and I‚Äôm seeing all the people around me in a whole new light.

Well it created mine.</Title><Author>u/infinitejellyfishmd</Author><Content>love is amazing, I think about my parents. They had a forbidden love. My mom joined the Navy as a doctor she was in the navy for about 2 years when she met my dad. he was an enlisted sailor they met by chance when my dad was sent back to the us after being wounded. he had been in for 6 years. he was receiving care and recovering in the hospital where she was working      My dad was finishing up his degree and was studying for his MCATS test while he was in the hospital. she worked the night shift and would help him study. Some spark was there, they started to date and they got into trouble.  they kept dating so I guess they hid it better. my mom asked my dad to come home with her for Thanksgiving.      My grandparents are very affluent they did not like my dad they felt he was beanth their social class because he was from a poor family, did not have fancy table manners, and did not own a suit So my dad broke it off because he felt she should have somebody better. my grandfather told my dad he was going to ruin her life and that she had already gotten in trouble because of him. that he was destroying her life and that my mom was just sluming and was just a passing phase in her life.      My mom was heartbroken, my dad said she should have somebody better than him. she goes out to his house and confronts him. asked what he has been doing for the past 2 months. he told her he was waiting to see about getting out of the military. she asked him about med school, and he said he applied to 5 schools and was waiting for the results.  They talked for a few weeks and rekindled their love. on the pretense of if he got into med school he was good enough for her. mom said she would have stayed anyways but she knew he was going to get in.      Well, he did get accepted not only that he finished  like in the top of his class and matched to be a surgeon. They dated while he was in med school and then got married they have been married for 20 years now, and they still love each other, like really love each other. grandparents accepted my dad, but my mom stuck it to them they wanted to do the whole fancy southern bell wedding. they just drove to Vegas and got married.      like they still write each other love letters send cards and flowers. like my dad even sent my mom a cake for the day of their first kiss. my mom makes cute gift boxes all decorated for each holiday  and fills them with snacks. and will get the little Debbie snack for each holiday. my dad love them.      what I really think about is if my dad wasn't sent to that hospital, I would have never been born. like the smallest thing in life can change so much.</Content></post><post><Title>Does anyone know any real life example of platonic soulmates/partners?</Title><Author>u/Wild-Mushroom2404</Author><Content>I‚Äôve been lurking on this subreddit because I find it fascinating but almost every other post is about romantic love and this is what saddens me. I‚Äôve been identifying as aromantic for 4 years, I never had crushes and the entire concept of romance is pretty vague to me, something I can only experience in media. There was a time when I was worried that there‚Äôs something wrong with me but I‚Äôve let go long ago and realized that I don‚Äôt have to force myself to change. It will only break other people‚Äôs hearts. As long as I have other sources of love in my life, I will feel fulfilled.      I am a very loving person though. I failed to make friends when I was a kid and I really suffered from loneliness, this was also the time when I dreamed about finding a boyfriend, because the amatoheteronormative society makes you believe like that‚Äôs they key for everything, whereas everything I did with my imaginary boyfriend was platonic. I simply craved connection. After graduating from high school I moved away, ended up in a better environment and started forming real, genuine bonds. I have three friends that I value the most and I could most certainly say I‚Äôd take a bullet for them. One of them I‚Äôm particularly close with. She gets me like no one else does, sometimes it literally feels like we were born to meet each other. And we joke around how we‚Äôre gonna get married when we‚Äôre older, have dogs and a white picket fence and stuff like that, a Boston marriage basically. This thought makes me happy. I guess partnership in general is a very attractive idea for me, if I could have a bestie/sibling to share my life with it would be wonderful. I remember one of the early signs of me being aromantic was hearing adults complain that they ‚Äúlive like siblings now after years of marriage‚Äù and not understanding what‚Äôs the problem. This is like the strongest possible bond, why would people complain??      But the truth is, all my friends are still alloromantic. Most likely at some point they will have a need to be with someone they‚Äôre in love with. It would take insane amounts of luck to find someone I could share my life with platonically. I‚Äôve pretty much resigned myself to the idea that I‚Äôll be single my whole life‚Ä¶ but if, by any chance, you know actual examples of platonic life partners‚Ä¶ please share with me, so that I can have some hope.</Content></post><post><Title>How do you practice self love and how has it helped in your daily life?

I find myself feeling so much more at home around her than I do around others. We fall into a (super cute imo) routine whenever we‚Äôre around each other. Recently, we went on a small vacation, and the hotel breakfast had a small area where you return your plates, and I found myself returning her plates for her sometimes and she‚Äôd return my plates for me sometimes too. And there‚Äôs so many more small examples of this type of stuff too. She‚Äôs the first person I feel like I could hand my phone to while it‚Äôs unlocked and I don‚Äôt fear her snooping through it. I‚Äôve always been very careful around sharing my personality but I find myself feeling so at ease around her. Additionally, I lowkey can‚Äôt take my eyes off of her.

One day, however far in the future from now, you will be reading this, a letter from 23-year-old me, filled with longing, confusion, yearning, and deep emotional sensitivity ‚Äì but, ultimately, predominantly hope.      I need you to know that maybe I haven‚Äôt met you, but I love you already. I need you to know that you make me full. You make me feel whole and complete, you make me feel like all of this waiting was completely and utterly worth it. You make me happy. You give me hope in humanity. You give me strength.      I need you to know that I will protect our future children with all of my might and strength. I need you to know that I haven‚Äôt been perfect, but I always strive for betterment. I will always listen to constructive criticism, and put my very best foot forward in improving. I need you to know that I want our love to be characterized by growth, and both of us looking forward, propelling us in our respective very best directions.      I need you to know that if and when I inevitably mess up, it‚Äôs never on purpose. I need you to know that I can get a little confused, but I‚Äôm trying my best to figure things, and myself, out. I need you to know that I‚Äôll never intentionally hurt you, and if I do, I hope that you can confide in me and let me know that I have. I hope you‚Äôll be able to forgive me, and I hope you know that I‚Äôll always forgive you for the same. I know you won‚Äôt be perfect either, and that we‚Äôll both have our own baggage that we enter the relationship with. I hope you know that I‚Äôm here to help you carry yours, and I know you‚Äôre here to help me carry mine.      I hope you know I love you in your imperfections, and I see perfection in your heart. Both of us will work on bringing the best out in each other, lifting the other up when we stumble. I hope you can love me in my imperfection, and know that I always mean well, even if it‚Äôs inevitably misguided.      I need you to know that I lay in bed at night longing for you. I need you to know how excited I am to fall asleep next to you, to lay in bed next to you. I can‚Äôt wait to see the sunlight pour on your face in the mornings, I can‚Äôt wait to make you breakfast in bed. I can‚Äôt wait to stroke your hair as we watch movies, I cannot wait to kiss you. I cannot wait to hug you, I cannot wait to hold your hand. I cannot wait for us to one day create a happy home, and hopefully a family, together. I cannot wait to be the best father that I can be. I hope you know that you and our future family give me strength, I hope you know that I am putting in the work now to become the very best man that I can be for us.      I hope you know that sometimes I‚Äôll worry, but when I do, it‚Äôs out of care. I will care, and I‚Äôll care a lot. All I need is the slightest bit of reassurance ‚Äì a little goes a long way. Maybe sometimes I‚Äôll need a firm hand to smack me back into reality and get my head screwed on straight. I hope you know if you do it lovingly, and even with a good sense of humor, I‚Äôll appreciate it, laugh it off, and carry on.      I hope you know I love you. I hope you know that sometimes I can lose myself in love. The boundaries of my heart readily dissolve ‚Äì I‚Äôm working on it. I hope you know that you will be my very source of inspiration, my greatest strength, my ultimate weakness, and you will set my heart aflame. I hope you know it already burns for you, and I rise each day determined to conquer, for I want to be strong for those I love.      I hope you are ready for me too. I hope you‚Äôre longing for me too. I hope you know that I am going to give you everything I possibly can, and I cannot wait to create a beautiful life together.      I love you.      I can‚Äôt wait to laugh with you. I can‚Äôt wait to laugh with you, to be silly with you, to ugly cry with you, to make you dinner, to make you breakfast, to pack you food to work with cute little notes, to do anything and everything I possibly can to remind you how much I love you. I hope you know I will be very protective, and if anyone slights you, I may need to restrain myself. I hope you know that you are my passion, you are my fuel, you are my sunshine, and that we were made for each other.      I cannot wait to dance under the moonlight with you, to be swept away by the impossible magic of the moment. I cannot wait to embrace serendipity with you, to embrace spontaneity, to embrace the mystery latent within each moment just as we embrace the immense mystery of our love, that mystifying and impossible force that confuses all of our senses, and yet provides the greatest clarity conceivable.      I love you, I love you, I love you, and I‚Äôm marching towards you now.</Content></post><post><Title>I don‚Äôt know how I got so lucky, but I‚Äôve found the kind of love I thought didn‚Äôt exist.</Title><Author>u/Major_Seventh_</Author><Content>That feels like such a corny title, but I grew up only knowing what love was because I saw so many examples of what I knew it wasn‚Äôt. Now I know without a shadow of a doubt that I have found what it truly is.      We met organically last year when he started taking lessons at the music store I work at. Our first date was only supposed to be a casual dinner at a pizza place we both like, but we wound up spending the next 24 hours together just talking and laughing. We still act up the same way, often staying up far too late just holding each other in bed while we laugh ourselves to tears or talk about something substantial.      As soon I started becoming a regular overnight visitor in his house, he made sure he always had my favorite creamer in the refrigerator. In fact, I don‚Äôt believe I‚Äôve made my own coffee once in the near-year since.      I knew I was in love when I realized that, in any situation, I would rather be with him than be alone.      He always keeps fresh flowers in the kitchen for me. I‚Äôve never seen them fully wilt before new ones are put in their place. When he first started this, I asked why he kept getting new ones. He explained that they‚Äôre not expensive(He likes to pick his own arrangements from Publix), and they‚Äôre worth the smile they put on my face. He also has a really beautiful sentiment that I would butcher if I tried to relay it the same way, but it‚Äôs essentially that they‚Äôre more special because they can‚Äôt last forever. He‚Äôs also a big fan of Noah Kahan and Wesley Schultz‚Äô ‚ÄúIf We Were Vampires‚Äù for the same reason.      I love seashells. It‚Äôs always been a subconscious interest that was definitely brought to the surface by his mother, who is an obsessive sheller in the best way possible(We love to joke about the ‚ÄòGatherer Instinct‚Äô). It‚Äôs something that she and I have deeply bonded over. For Mother‚Äôs Day this year, we conspired with his parents to take a shelling trip to a nearby island. He does not care about seashells, and he is politely very honest about this. Yet, this entire day, he scoured the beach looking for the ones he knows are my favorites. I watched his dad do the same thing for his mom, and I understood where he had inherited his selfless, considerate way of love. His parents are incredible people, a beautiful example of a healthy and successful love.      It‚Äôs just little things like this, all the time. Everything he does is with consideration for me. He‚Äôs never once acted complacent. I‚Äôve never seen him angry. Everything about him makes me want to be the best that I can be, because he deserves that and so much more. He is truly my hero. I‚Äôm really just incredibly thankful that I‚Äôve found someone who so readily created a safe place for my heart to rest. I know I‚Äôve found my forever here, and for probably the first real time, I am so excited to see what‚Äôs in store.</Content></post><post><Title>Creating a playlist in my phone of songs I would listens to with my future gf/soulmate</Title><Author>u/WolfFamous6976</Author><Content>The name of the playlist is called ‚Äúlate night drives with bae‚Äù.

I'm a guy, so she could never be attracted to me romantically. However I still love what we have and never want to lose her.      Right now all I can describe it as, is the deepest platonic love. The bond we have was instant and keeps growing deeper. We work together too, so spend most week days either together or if we're working remotely, we chat my message or call most of the day. We can literally talk for 6+ hours of the work day non-stop. On some occasions, on long days, we can be together for over 12 hours, inseparable, as once the day ends, we'll hang out afterwards to chat and unwind from the day.      The love and care we have for each other is insane, we always look out for each other and put each other first. We've never had a single disagreement, since the day we met. People think we are a couple when they see us together and they don't even know the bond we have behind that. She jokingly refers to us as a couple, as that's honestly what it feels like, everything is done together and we care for each other like only a couple would. Most couples don't even have what we have...      We are so similar, that we share a lot of the same interests, but the ones we don't, we just love to listen to each other talk about our passions, but not only listen, but ask each other questions, remember all the little details and try to share an interest in these passions too. She remembers the smallest little details of our conversations, just like I do with hers.      We can be anywhere and doing anything, but that time makes me feel so content and relaxed. I believe it's a mutual feeling, as she opens up to me in a way she doesn't seem to with anyone else. Neither of us are social people, except when alone together. If we're together in a group setting, we are comfortable because we have each other, but we still don't say a lot, then as soon as we're alone, we're back to being ourselves, with no filters.      I love her so so much. More than I can explain. If all it can be is deep platonic love, then I guess that's okay. A romantic love would be nice, but it's not an option. I miss her so much on the days when we don't talk, if she's busy with family. It's like a piece of me is missing.</Content></post><post><Title>What to surprise your (male) partner with at the airport?</Title><Author>u/Ulwoja</Author><Content>Hi.

I havent worn any in months but today I wore concealer, a nude glitter eyeshadow and mascara and a bit of lipstick. My boyfriend thought I looked pretty, and told me before I went to work. But at the end of the day when I washed it all off and came to say goodnight to him he just smiled wide and said "wow. just wow. you look so gorgeous" and i smiled but said "i basically look the same as i did 5 seconds ago" but he looked at me and said "but with less makeup" and i told him i was barely wearing any? but he couldnt stop smiling at me, kissing me, and hugging me and i found it really sweet. i feel like i bought new makeup for nothing!! just kidding, i still like to wear it but i feel happy knowing i dont have to try to be different for my boyfriend :)</Content></post><post><Title>Loving my partner as family, not just as romance and flowers stuff</Title><Author>u/lion_percy</Author><Content>My partner is the love of my life. They're the one I lived for when I was trying to survive in an abusive home (when it was worse than ever), they're the one who believed that I can still survive. Before I met him, I just felt numb, nothingness. I disassociated often and lived simply for myself, and because I wanted new experiences. Except, I felt numb and empty.      My love for him and the connection has motivated me to keep living, even when things were tough af at home. I kept living simply because I loved him. I was so miserable, but that love was what kept me alive and going. My mental health is much better now (even though I'm still living in this place), but I think that if I hadn't met my partner, I'd be a literal psychopath or sociopath, or probably just dead tbh-      He's like family to me. He was like a mentor, but also like a life-long companion. I feel like the connection extends beyond just romance and flowers. I feel like it extends to companionship and even family. I want to spend forever with him, holding his hand      If I lost my memory, I'd still fall in love with him, I'm confident about that. And if he lost his memory, he'd probably fall in love with me again too.</Content></post><post><Title>Gushing about my girlfriend because I haven‚Äôt seen her in a while.</Title><Author>u/UncensoredSmoke</Author><Content>Haven‚Äôt seen my girlfriend for a few days and can‚Äôt stop thinking about her so I‚Äôm just gonna write a few things.

What is wrong with me ?</Title><Author>u/CHLTC12345</Author><Content>What is wrong with me ?      Short background. M24. Had a gf from 17-24. An intense relationship growing up together and discovering everything together. Besides the point.      Whenever I meet someone, and we have a romantic interaction, anything from flirting to sex, it feels as though I fall in love with them, instantly.      My mind cannot stop thinking about someone.      The worst part, is after even the smallest interactions like kissing or whatever, I will imagine a whole flurry of scenarios with that person. Sometimes I build an entire imagination of me with that person.      My most recent one was just 1.5 days ago. Got along really well with this girl and we kissed etc. I‚Äôve only ever spent about 30 mins with this person and now she is all I can think about. With this girl, I have done as I said above, i have imagined 100 scenarios with them already and I don‚Äôt even know them.      In a way it is nice to feel things so intensely but in another way it‚Äôs utterly utterly exhausting. And inevitably always disappointing.

Anyway, I saw something that I maybe never noticed. On half of her pictures she gives off these smug fuckboy vibes(she was the rocker girl/carefree/tomboy type). It got me thinking.      We started off as lovers but instantly became best friends and while we had no filter with each other, her feminine side while she was with me was the only thing I remember. I can't remember her masculine side or funny moments, only her sweet, romantic and nurturing side.

And they don‚Äôt like themselves, because they base their self-worth onyour approval and what you think of them! It's cyclical.      You‚Äôre disappointed in your performance, because you learned from others‚Äô disappointment in you. And,since you want their approval, you take on their disapproval.Why do you give someone else the power to decide how you choose to feel about yourself? You do that when you make them the source of your self-love.  You were raised to believe your emotions come from outside of you (i.e. your circumstances and other people).So you believe you have to work hard to change your circumstances, so you can change your emotions. And you believe you have to earn stuff to impress other people, so then both people and circumstances can give you your emotions (i.e. feeling loved, worthy, supported, accepted and appreciated).      But when you remember thatyour emotions come from your thoughts,then you remember that you have the power and freedom to feel better whenever you want, and eventually feel good enough.      ~ BFree      .

Ive had feelings for this friend for a while now and I did ask her to be my gf but she said if we‚Äôre still single by 30 she‚Äôll date me. I‚Äôm not sure how to take that but I‚Äôm trying to see the positives out of it. Back to the dream I started in the middle of the dream so it was ambiguous on whether or not the child was mine but my friend had pretty much become my wife. The unexplainable happiness I felt being there with her raising a child was amazing but eventually it was revealed the child wasn‚Äôt mine and the father had come back into my friends life. And my friend just left me and went on to raise her child with the father. It felt like part of my life had been taken away from me. My son and my wife were just gone. I woke up and realized of course that it was just a sad dream but all of those emotions I felt are still there I remember the joy of living as a family and the heartbreak of losing that. It feels like there‚Äôs a hole in my heart  and it‚Äôs driving me insane. Every time I have a moment to think I just feel so alone it‚Äôs like my brain just wants to go back to that feeling of bliss even though I‚Äôm not really ready for that kind of relationship. I really needed to vent to someone anonymously so if you‚Äôve read this I deeply thank you</Content></post><post><Title>Is there "true" love? What does it even mean. I feel like love means something different for everyone</Title><Author>u/mark_98</Author><Content>I feel like each person has a different definition of Love.  What one says and the other hears can be 2 different messages.      I thought I was in love because of the "energy" I felt from my last partner.  Skin to skin contact made us feel like 1 soul, in my mind.  Being around her felt great.  When she was happy I felt it.  When she hurt I felt it. She lied a lot, gas lit, cheated.  I made many mistakes too, but after she admitted some things I believe I was not acting like myself because I was always on the edge.  Regardless, the emotional connection I had, and still have, is like nothing else I experienced with any woman.  I met her at 30 and had been with plenty women before hand.  Breaking up with her 1 year ago has almost destroyed me.      We both are in therapy, separately, but had some contact again recently.  I feel myself wanting to return.  I cannot imagine that feeling being replicated.  I am worried that it is just fear about life.  I feel as I have no purpose, passion, or desire.  I just want a life with her.  Even if that means a difficult one.      The rationale part of me says I will just be hurt again.      Married men I know do not share these feelings that I bring up.  They are married because of the type of person the partner is, but are not emotionally connected it seems.</Content></post><post><Title>Friday, I'm in love...!

She was "Oooo"ing and "Ahhh"ing as though I had presented her with fine jewelry.      Y'all this mustache is NOT hot.  To make matters worse, it's in the fledgling stage where it hasn't yet hit puberty and blossomed into a facial feature.  Yet she keeps coming up and touching it and getting all flirty and authentically complimenting it.  She's actually reverse-gaslighted me into thinking it looks good.      I think she knew I'd be self conscious about it and is going overboard in trying to make me feel good about it.  We both know it ISN'T a good mustache, but she's 22 weeks pregnant so I've gotten good at hyping her up about her appearance, too.  I wonder if she's returning the favor.

At the appointed time for my master plan, we got dressed and walked downstairs after I confirmed everyone was there via text.      Everyone wasn't.      I walked her downstairs to our "reservation" for dinner. We walked across the street to the gazebo on the town square. As we walked up, she saw our family there. (At least, those that live here.) My mom and dad, who she really loves, my sister and her family and our aunt. And a stranger.      "What did you do?"      "I dunno what you are talking about."      Then my two kids (eventually) walked up with a dozen long stem roses I had them pick up earlier. (They were delayed by traffic. We had an uncomfortable silence while we waited for them and my wife wondered what was going on.) I gave a short speech about how I loved her, and I'd be honored if she would re-marry me and handed her the roses. She broke down crying. Success! I do my best to make her cry with happiness on a regular basis. Romance yo.      The stranger was a fellow teacher who was also a pastor. He did a great job and we had a wonderful ceremony. Today I showed my students pictures from the ceremony and talked about it and they loved it. My wife loved it. Everything was great.      But the thing is, later that night I tripped HARD on a sidewalk curb. I would have broken the big toe on my left foot had I not been wearing boots and a kilt. As it is, I jammed the toenail hard, and it is bruised all to hell and bleeding. I'll probably lose it. That caused to me to fall. Now, I'd had a few drinks, but I wasn't hammered. Still, I fell HARD onto my fucking face. Broke my expensive eyeglasses. Gave myself my eighth concussion, badly skinned up my knee and it hurts like hell on the bone, hurt my elbow, both shoulders. Huge black eye. scrapes on my face. Fucking hell.      Thankfully a very kind man helped me up and I made it back to the hotel. I fell asleep unhappy, but not aware of how bad it was until I woke up in the morning. A trip to the doctor later and I'm on bed rest until Thursday. Yay.      I had a great night up until that point. Happy anniversary u/griffingrl .</Content></post><post><Title>Hello! I made this art for a couple who met online as a gift for them.

As the weeks went on I will say it was like Pandora‚Äôs box I must say. Feelings I‚Äôve suppressed for awhile have slowly come back, which is good! I have opened up to family and friends again which has felt liberating. but now I will say that I have slowly been thinking about my Ex more in light of these admissions that had held me back for so long.      It‚Äôs a complicated situation between us if I am honest and I must admit I am scared again. I believe it‚Äôs too late on my end as it has honestly been awhile. I would also be scared to admit any feelings still as i still feel they are suppressed a bit and i also am so scared that I may hurt her as it destroyed me to hurt her the first time, as that was someone i loved so much at the time it literally broke me when i did it.      The good news is i am aware of these feelings and instead of pushing them down i am attempting to shift through them.

Maybe it‚Äôs because I‚Äôve never dated anyone who gets me the way he does. I‚Äôve never dated anyone who sees me at my lowest points and encourages me to keep going. I‚Äôve never dated anyone who makes every night feel like a sleepover with my best friend and makes every day feel magical in the smallest ways.      In the grand scheme of life, we haven‚Äôt been dating that long. A year as of Mothers Day. We‚Äôve talked about marriage but we both have debts and other mountains to climb before it becomes anything more than dreamy late night talks.      But the thing is, I met this man years ago. We were both in our early 20s and we met at the bus station by chance through a mutual friend. Over the next decade, we‚Äôd occasionally chat on Facebook messenger or on Discord. We‚Äôd play games together. Then we‚Äôd go without talking for years until one day out of the blue we‚Äôd fall back into the same rhythm.      He asked me out once before the time I said yes in 2023. I ghosted him at the time because I had too many things going on and mentally I couldn‚Äôt even handle the thought of dating. Most would have given up. He came back again in 2023 and asked me out again, except this time, I said yes. And my life has never been the same.      So maybe it‚Äôs the unshakable thought that this feels like fate, or because this is the only person who ever has looked at me and has seen ALL of me and has laughed and loved me all the same, but I can‚Äôt fathom the thought of not marrying this man. I cant close my eyes and picture a future without him in it. And I just had to get this off of my chest because more and more I fall so deeply in love and I lay beside him every night in bed and hope he feels the same.</Content></post><post><Title>Just want to take the time out to show some appreciation for my beautiful family ü§ûüèæ</Title><Author>u/Umpire-Hairy</Author><Content>No content</Content></post><post><Title>This is a poem a wrote about a person I am into.</Title><Author>u/W3rld</Author><Content>I look in your eyes for solutions      to questions      you couldn‚Äôt possibly have the answers for.      Neither of us can know.      Yet, both us      seem to be to blame.      And that‚Äôs what keeps us      so distant.      Just as the storm had begun to clear      the sun shone through the haze, and      you seemingly dropped out of the sky,      and onto my lap.      Beckoning me      with the pleasure of your presence.      My mind is a cork board      full of pushpins, and chaotic lines      of red thread.      And still,      all the educating,      extrapolating,      and pontificating      on the laws of desire      go out the window      the moment two hearts      begin to speak the same language.</Content></post><post><Title>Jealousy is not part of love, jealousy is part of possessiveness.</Title><Author>u/Suspicious_Ferret109</Author><Content>Jealousy has nothing to do with love. In fact, your so-called love also has nothing to do with love.      These are beautiful words which you use without knowing what.they mean, without experiencing what they mean. You go on using the word 'love'. You use it so much that you forget the fact that you have not experienced it yet. That is one of the dangers of using such beautiful words: 'God', 'love', NIRVANA, 'prayer' beautiful words. You go on using them, you go on repeating them, and by and by, the very repetition makes you feel as if you know.      What do you know about love? If you know anything about love, jealousy is never present in love. And wherever jealousy is present, love is not present.      Jealousy is not part of love, jealousy is part of possessiveness. Possessiveness has nothing to do with love. You want to possess. Through possession you feel strong: your territory is bigger. And if somebody else tries to trespass on your territory, you are angry. Or if somebody has a bigger house than your house, you are jealous. Of if somebody tries to dispossess you of your property, you are jealous and angry.      If you love, jealousy is impossible; it is not possible at all.      Jealousy has nothing to do with love. If you love your woman, how can you be jealous? If you love your man, how can you be jealous? If your woman is laughing with somebody else, how can you be jealous? You will be happy: it is your woman who is happy; her happiness is your happiness. How can you think against her happiness?      But look, watch. It is happening everywhere, in every family. The wife even becomes jealous of the newspaper if the husband goes on reading it too much. She comes and snatches it away: she becomes jealous. The newspaper is substituting for her. While she is present, how dare you read your newspaper? That is an insult! When she is there you have to be possessed by her totally not even a newspaper... The newspaper becomes a competitor.      So what to say about human beings? If the wife is present, and the husband starts talking to another woman and looks a little happy - which is natural: people get tired of each other; anything new and one feels a little thrilled - now the wife is angry. You can know well that if a couple is going by and the man looks sad, then he is the husband married to that woman. If he looks happy, he is not married to the woman. She is not HIS wife.      You are not really in love with your woman, or with your man, or with your friend. If you are in love, then his or her happiness is your happiness. If you are in love, then you will not create any possessiveness.      Love is capable of giving total freedom. ONLY love is capable of giving total freedom. And if freedom is not given, then it is something else, not love. It is a certain type of egoistic trip.      You have a beautiful woman. You want to show everybody, all around the town, that you have a beautiful woman - just like a possession. Just as when you have a car and you are into your car, you want everybody to know that nobody has such a beautiful car. The same is the case with your woman. You bring diamonds for her, but not out of love. She is a decoration for your ego. You carry her from one club to another, but she has to remain clinging to you and go on showing that she belongs to you. Any infringement of your right and you are angry - you can kill the woman... whom you think you love.      There is great ego working everywhere. We want people to be like things. We possess them like things, we reduce persons into things. The same is the attitude about things also.      That is the mind - continuously in competition. Now he is doing circumcision; he has to do something. That is the way we are living: the way of the ego. The ego knows no love, the ego knows no friendship, the ego knows no compassion. The ego is aggression, violence.      Jealousy never follow love as a shadow.      Never.      Love makes no shadow at all. Love is so transparent that it makes no shadow. Love is not a solid thing, it is transparency. No shadow is created out of love. Love is the only phenomenon on the earth which creates no shadow.</Content></post><post><Title>Is love supposed to make you nervous?

Neither of us have real support in life (them less than me especially...) so as I've recently seen them get hurt in their relationship multiple times and know that both of us struggle with self-love, wanting to genuinely tell them their worth has been gnawing away at me recently because I had always assumed their partner was that source of comfort for them.      They don't know it, but in the short time of connecting and learning about each other they've helped me gain a lot of confidence and growth in being myself and in tackling life and I feel like I'd be letting them down as a friend if I didn't express this in a more honest and emotional way to them BECAUSE I know they struggle with all of the same things that I do so its harder to ignore the pain they go through.      I personally know how self-doubt makes us not believe in the things people say to us. So I want to be open heartedly genuine because I know how strong of an impact that can have on a person and hopefully it connects with them but don't want to come across as a "white knight" swooping in an opportunity, yknow.      I know that most people would treat opening up so emotionally as having alterior motives and although I know they'd be less likely to see that...if I come across the wrong way and all of a sudden our past connections lose all trust in being genuine and just seem like a ploy to be close to them I'd legitimately be heartbroken.</Content></post><post><Title>Raised with more hate than love, never cared or felt anything for relationships. Do I learn to embrace love or forget about it?</Title><Author>u/DalinsiaValkyrPrime</Author><Content>I‚Äôve made a post before. There I also spoke about how I never felt anything for anyone, how all the relationships I‚Äôve ever seen were toxic to varying degrees, and other things I can‚Äôt recall right now.      However, as the title states‚Ä¶ there was more hate as I grew up. My mother still feels guilty that she didn‚Äôt leave and somewhat encouraged my father‚Äôs behavior towards me. Through that, I really only learned that I should use one emotion.      Rage.      That rage only pushed people (who I was already isolated by) away. I hardly had any friends and was ostracized by practically everyone as I grew up. It‚Äôs kind of hard to imagine love then. I did many physical outbursts on myself, passing out once from a blind rage. The scars are shameful, but very small in number compared to my others.      Now, I just wonder what it feels like. I‚Äôve heard it is peace, fulfilling, wonderful, etc. Is that what it really is? I know love isn‚Äôt easy, but neither is the toll of hate and anger on the body. Even though I like being by myself a lot, just being capable of feeling something would be enough. I‚Äôve heard the ‚Äúhate takes more energy than love‚Äù, but then you would have to call me the mitochondria.      I‚Äôve been in therapy. Coming up on 6 years. Different therapists, different methods, but I just see it as worthless. Paying the price of a motorcycle in total over the years for what feels like a simple conversation. It feels pathetic, as if I need to pay to talk to someone. I actually have an appointment today in the next hour.      I‚Äôve even been hit on multiple times recently, but I didn‚Äôt find it flattering. I found it annoying, irritating, and (sounds horrible) disgusting. I want to learn how it can be genuine and flattering.      I never had feelings and don‚Äôt think I can, so I don‚Äôt even know if that‚Äôs a possibility. Might be better off though. If I‚Äôm being honest, there are aspects of romantic/sexual love that I find somewhat repulsive.      What should I push myself towards. The majority of myself that is just saying ‚Äúdo you really think love is a key component to life? You can live without it.‚Äù While the minority part of my mindset is ‚ÄúEven if it‚Äôs just once, open your heart to love. Yes, you don‚Äôt NEED it to live, but it can certainly be a step for you to take.‚Äù      It‚Äôs confusing and I don‚Äôt know what to do.</Content></post><post><Title>I'm unsure what kind of people would love me long term</Title><Author>u/melanie_mighty</Author><Content>No content</Content></post><post><Title>I don't know what to do, how to feel, or if I should be crying as hard as I am right now</Title><Author>u/StarLight_Art</Author><Content>Me and my boyfriend have been together for 4 months, but I've known him for three years. Me and him haven't had a ton of rockyness other than when he comes to me about his mental health. He is the kind that blocks people out of his life to deal with it on his own, and I'm the kind of person who wants to talk about everything, be open and find a solution. On many accounts he has told me he might break up with me, because the battles he is fighting in his head are getting to be to much, and I tell him the same thing I can tell him. "I love you so much, and I don't want you to leave me. But if it helps you, and you can feel better by doing this I'm in full support. I know you are hurting, and we can try a break if you would like, I just want you to know I'm here to listen to anything that's going on in your mind."      Usual he ends up telling me it's fine, and he just needs to think about everything. He has been adamant on when school gets out he will make the decision if we need to take a break, or break up. And because we have a week left, I've been crying a ton. Fearing the man I have loved for so so long is going to leave me. And I know it's not my fault and I know this is to benefit him in every way, I just don't know what I'd do without him. He is my everything and I love him so much. I don't want to see him and begin to break down. I've cried Infront of him three times and one of those times was to tell me about this situation I'm in. Walked up to him and just staired at the floor. Thinking don't cry don't cry don't cry. But he pulled me into him, and held me, whispered in my ear to let it out. And I bawled. Hard. Loud hard, in the middle of a school hallway.      I'm not dependant on him by any means, I don't need his attention all the time but he truly is my rock. 4 months of dating with a year of pent up love hurts when it's ripped away from you..I just want him to get better, i want him to be okay, i want us to stay together. But I have no control over that now, and I'll I need to do is be there for him, and hope and pray for him      Please give me any advice you think I need from this post. Weather it's something to keep me from crying or something to better understand that it's not my fault. I don't know right now, I'm writing this and crying hard in my bedroom.</Content></post><post><Title>Anyone else out there straight their whole lives then suddenly fell for the same sex?</Title><Author>u/Fabulous-Bandicoot40</Author><Content>I (37f) have always dated and been attracted to men, but not as intensely as people around me seemed to be. With most guys I dated I could take sex or leave it, except like 2 who I bonded emotionally quite deeply with then did enjoy sex with them. I almost thought I was borderline asexual or demisexual or something.      I have lots of close female friends whom I love but have never had any attraction to them at all. Even ones I know are conventionally beautiful.      Recently, I randomly met a woman (straight, married but has confessed to having crushes on women in the past) and we spent a lot of time together over the span of a few weeks and I fell hard. I considered myself a slow burn and told potential partners it takes me a long time to be comfortable with intimacy, but this hit like a semi truck. I‚Äôm now reevaluating my whole life, what this means for my sexuality, and what I will be looking for moving forward. Just wondering if people in similar situations could share their experiences.</Content></post><post><Title>I don‚Äôt know what to do and I feel really sad about it</Title><Author>u/HelpMyHead12</Author><Content>i don't really know how or where to start. i also don't really know what i'm asking for. i guess i'm just venting, but i'm open to suggestions, thoughts, or just a different perspective. my boyfriend and i are both 26, having met at 16 and begun dating 5 months after meeting online, so this year will be our 10 year anniversary. we went to different high schools, lived in different towns, went to different colleges, we've seen each other (mainly me) through a lot. from the outside, i think our relationship looks perfect. at our core, we are bestfriends. our favorite things to do are go for diet coke runs, take walks, try new restaurant spots, drive to look at christmas lights, you know the mundane things in life. recently i've felt this immense pressure to take our relationship to the next level which would be getting an apartment. however, my boyfriend is still very much finding his footing in the real world in terms of a stable and realistic job. for about half of our relationship, he's been working a job that has horrible hours (nights and weekends) which has made hanging out hard, but not impossible. i've just gotten used to him not being around for parties, work events, day trips, sadly. anyway, now after a long road of exploring options, he's in a program to become certified in something he's interested in, so i'm happy for him. in another few weeks, we will be able to rekindle saturday mornings and random weekday afternoons. i do wonder if this will be big for our quality time. but, with him switching roles, i don't know when he'll be financially ready to take the next steps of getting an apartment. but i know i can't have it both ways. either he's miserable at his current job while he makes a salary but can't spend much time with me, or train to do something else he'll ultimately like and allow us more time together but he may not be financially stable just yet. with that said, i've been feeling the pressures of all the things that make us different. we're different political parties, different religions, i'm more outspoken, he's more passive, i'm messier, he's cleaner. i feel like we've both developed this habit of thinking the other person should check every single box of what the other one wants or expects, so we bicker a lot, at least recently. when this happens we both usually get very defensive and put a wall up but once we realize what we're doing we generally are quite good at communicating properly. but sometimes it just feels like we're always bickering, or always problem solving, always figuring out more effective ways to continue staying together. sometimes this really messes with my head because recently i've been wondering if the grass is greener on the other side... with someone else would it be easier if we were both outspoken and didn't need to have conversations one whose religion is being compromised on when we have kids? idk. i've never questioned our relationship before but i've gotten into this weird headspace as of the last few weeks of feeling like one foot is out and one foot is in which is really hurtful when i've always prided my boyfriend and myself on being entirely committed to one another and "making it work" and "figuring it out." is this normal life stuff? or is my gut telling me it's not destined to work between us? surely any relationship is going to struggle sometimes. i just feel weird. i feel worried that once we live together i'm going to have to tip-toe around his need for things to be a certain way or else he'll judge me for being too messy. how can we know if we'll be good together if we don't live together yet? at the end of the day, i try to picture myself on my wedding day and i don't know how to picture it. is it him? is it someone else? is this anxiety? is this a sign? i feel so upset that i don't know. i sometimes wonder if it would be easier to decipher some of these things if i had more experience with dating other men to have more of a comparison, but i think i just got lucky on my first try. the idea of dating other people feels both terrifying yet exciting, but then i think about how when i'm sad all i want is my boyfriend because he's my bestfriend. or when i have good news, i want to share it with him. our families get along well. he always puts me on the inside of the sidewalk and walks me to the passenger side of the car and makes sure no one kidnaps me, but yet i'm upset he doesn't call me beautiful enough. i convince myself he doesn't like the way i look but instead he's just gotten used to me. why am i only thinking about the negatives and the things that separate us? why do i only focus on the problems we have? would it be different or would i feel more sure with someone else? i don't know if i want to break up to figure that out but am i missing out by staying here? am i messing out on life? i feel so unsure on what feels right right now. no one teaches you how to be an adult. this is really hard and confusing. i'm also unsure if i'm making this more complicated than it really needs to be.</Content></post><post><Title>What does true love feel like to you?

Every sniff of his cologne, picture of his face, and cuddle on his hoodie makes me cry. I dream about him all the time. He still gives me butterflies and makes me blush. I go absolutely feral for his smell and his voice. I love his ‚Äúflaws.‚Äù I could listen to him talk about anything forever. His mere presence makes me feel at peace.

I did not reply to him because i got upset but when I did, he was worried if I was okay.      Now, he was already scheduled for operation and he still was able to ask how i was, how was my stomach cause i got sick in the past and he was checking if it came back but the catch is he is the patient and with a broken bone, he is supposedly the one to be asked. I did tell him that. He also told me to check up on him before and after the surgery which I did and I got so exhausted after. I spent all my efforts to be motivational, caring and he did thank me and was very sweet on the messages, but I grew cold after the surgery.      I just got so tired of the emotional neediness and I'm not an emotional person. I just did that to help him. I know he also helped me for about 4 months always taking care of me and always asking me how i am and giving tips how to be well and visiting me in the hospital but I just find that I am already emotionally exhausted.      I feel sometimes like we both are treating each other emotionally as that of a partner's but the catch is he already has a partner. So i wonder why is it that I am always the one he goes to when everything is not well with him?      Right now, he seems to have noticed that i am growing cold but I can't help it. He seems to be asking a huge emotional support from me and also acting like he has emotional investment on me. Imagine he is the patient and is scheduled for surgery but he still ask how was my stomach? I really don't know what to think but I want to save the bond we have, the problem is that once I remove the barriers, he will go again and emotionally attach to me.</Content></post><post><Title>Loopy, high boyfriend coming off of anesthesia</Title><Author>Unknown author</Author><Content>My boyfriend (M21) had a very long, very invasive surgery today.

He comes out of the ICU, he doesn‚Äôt see me at first, and then the nurse points to me and says ‚Äúthere she is!‚Äù He looks at me, begins to cry and reaches his hands out for me like a baby, telling me I was the most beautiful thing he‚Äôs ever seen in the whole world, he is so happy to see me, he loves me, he can‚Äôt believe I‚Äôm his girlfriend, staring at my face, kissing my hands. The nurses told me he couldn‚Äôt stop talking about me when he woke up after the surgery. He grabbed my hand the whole way back to his room, and while we are in the room, every single time a nurse came in, he asked them ‚Äúisn‚Äôt she so pretty? This is my girlfriend!! She is so sweet‚Äù and I honestly could not keep myself from crying. He was in so much pain, yet he would still grab onto my hand and smile at me from his hospital bed. He would drift off to sleep still holding my hand, then wake up and freak out until I reassured him I was right next to him, and he would just smile so big and adorable and fall back asleep again. I don‚Äôt even know if he will remember all of this tomorrow, but I don‚Äôt care. I don‚Äôt know how I could love this boy even more, but I do.      Just wanted to gush.

And I work from home full time and provide for my family.      Through my office door, I can hear the kids definitely challenging her today. Just not listening, extra fussy. I left my office, and I can see all over my wife‚Äôs face that she is overwhelmed, stressed and tired.      Sooo. I called off work, gave her my credit card, we both have bank cards. And a joint account that we both use freely. But for today, I think some serious retail therapy is in order. And I will pay the balance off at the end of the month. So I am the one with the credit card. I gave her kiss a hug and kicked her out of the house.      I told her not to come back until she buys something for herself that she truly wants, eats a nice meal, drink a fancy drink, go get a message. Shoot, even book a hotel room for two days just to be by yourself and enjoy peace. Whatever you need to do for your self care, go do it! She gave me a kiss, a hug, didn‚Äôt fight me and left in her car.      Will she be back? I‚Äôm not sure üòÖ      Now im going to have a clam but firm conversation with our boys. On why they need to respect their mother. And challenge all of them on what we can do around the house to show her how much we love her. Before she gets back home.( if she comes back)      You see as a dad, I don‚Äôt struggle with kids like she does. Granted I work 9-5 so I am not with them all day. But when I do have days off, or let my wife sleep in while I cook the kids breakfast, or their lunch. I don‚Äôt get any back talk, attitudes. What I say goes and that‚Äôs it. If the kids are getting in each other‚Äôs nerves, I give them a warning and they stop. I don‚Äôt yell at them or spank them. If my wife and I are together with the kids. It‚Äôs calm and quiet. As soon as I leave let‚Äôs say to go to the bathroom, store whatever. All Hell breaks loose.      I grew up in a household where my parents were both physically, mentally and emotionally abusive to me. I wanted to kill myself at age five. My parents were both youth  pastors and prayed, encouraged and uplifted everyone at church. But behind closed doors. It was my hell. I survived suicide, alcoholism, depression and anxiety. I had really some serious trauma that I needed to work on. And learn how to love and be kind to myself. Admit my mistakes and confront my shame. Nearly killed me again. But made it out. Barley‚Ä¶.      Now 33m I haven‚Äôt left my faith in God. And I promised my self once I have kids, I won‚Äôt be like my parents.      I just feel so sorry for her and the stress she endures. I see her and acknowledge her hardship. I hope she stays out all day today and relaxes.      So how can truly bring it home to my children. That they need to respect their mother?      EDIT #1: my gosh! My DMs are blowing up so positive and some bad. To the positive ones I am enjoying the conversation and all your advice. As well as sharing my life story with you. And hearing your stories as well!      To the bad dms and comments. I am sorry if it came across as me bragging or wanting kudos. This is not the case. I was just telling a story of my day. And legit wanted advice to be a better father.      EDIT #2 : some people are hung on the credit card situation. She has her own credit card. We just paid it off and mutually decided together to do all the big spending on mine. Since we are in a one income household. We kept catch ourselves getting into debt and not communicating properly when we made purchases. So 2024 this was our New Year‚Äôs resolution we decided to do together when it comes to credit cards      EDIT #3 : She did come back. I had a baby sitter on standby to watch the kids at night. And I took her to a nice relaxing restaurant and bought stuff at Ulta</Content></post><post><Title>so i cuddled with my girlfriend for the first time</Title><Author>u/Ice-Senpai0323</Author><Content>we got together with our friends for halloween at her house, and while everyone was talking and eating, we were cuddling in the corner and being cute and shit. she laid her head on my lap and wore my hoodie as a blanket. i held her close and played with her hair. every so often she‚Äôd look up at me, giggle, and then lay her head back down. it made me feel more loved than i ever had in my entire life. at one point she looked me in the eye and said ‚Äúi love you‚Äù in an adorably sleepy kind of voice, my heart literally jumped out of my chest. after a while we decided to move to the couch. she pulled me close and buried my head in her chest as she told me how much i meant to her. i was holding back tears i was so happy. she slowly rubbed my back and wrapped her legs around me. i was so incredibly sad when we had to get up to wait for my family to pick me up. before i had to go, she took me up to her room and gave me one of her sweatshirts, since she had recently taken my hoodie. it smells just like her and makes me so happy to wear it. we sat on her front porch holding hands and talking about how much we were going to miss each other until my parents pulled up. it was easily the best night of my life.</Content></post><post><Title>My husband told me that I gained weight in the kindest way</Title><Author>u/nickle_da_pickle</Author><Content>Last night I asked my husband if I had gained weight because I felt like I had.

He looked at me and said ‚Äúsince the beginning of this relationship we have both gained a little weight‚Äù as he grabbed the tummy of his wonderful dad bod ‚Äúeven now, when we are walking in the store, I look at you and think wow. You are the perfect shape. Exactly what I like. However, if you feel the need to eat healthier I will do it with you. I know I can‚Äôt go to the gym with you because one of us has to stay home with our son (3yo), but we can start working on being healthier together.‚Äù And this brought me peace and gratitude. I just wanted to say ‚Äúthank you for being honest with me and validating my feelings about my body. Thank you for flowing love into your words about such a sensitive topic. Thank you for loving me enough to make this effort for me.

Somehow even when she‚Äôs sleeping, she registers what‚Äôs going on in the outside world. I, on the other hand, have sleep problems so I‚Äôm usually up later than she is. Some reports:      If I kiss her while she‚Äôs asleep, she always kisses back.      If I tell her I love her while she‚Äôs asleep, she says it back. Bonus: if I whisper it, she whispers back too.      If I shift around on the bed and get close to her shoulder, she kisses my forehead immediately.      If I ask to cuddle, she immediately puts her arms around me and kisses me.      Every time, she does this and goes right back to sleep. She‚Äôs only conscious for that split second it takes to respond. She has no memory of this in the morning. It makes me feel so special and safe.</Content></post><post><Title>I couldn‚Äôt reach my boyfriend for a while tonight and called him 15+ times before he answered. He was just sleeping. His reaction melted me.</Title><Author>u/ams712</Author><Content>Backstory: I am diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder. So yes, I have a problem, and I am actively working on it through medications and therapy.      My boyfriend always calls me before he goes to sleep. If for some reason he falls asleep without calling, which is very rare, I call him before I go to sleep which has always woken him up. (We only sleep apart from each other once a week).      Tonight for about an hour I couldn‚Äôt get a hold of him. Thinking back on it, rationally I should have realized he was probably deeply sleeping as he didn‚Äôt get much sleep the night before. But my anxiety convinced me he was dead somewhere.      So my call finally woke him up and I just was a sobbing, blubbering mess. He didn‚Äôt once berate me, make excuses, or make me feel stupid. He just apologized (he had nothing to apologize for) and reassured me. I told him i felt crazy. He said that is not true. He told me that my anxiety is part of me and he loves all of me, even the anxiety.      I‚Äôve never felt so reassured and safe. This man understands everything about me, even the parts I don‚Äôt truly understand fully. He understands my anxiety without ever having experienced it himself. He amazes me every day.</Content></post><post><Title>‚Äúthe prettiest girl in the world is laying in my bed and i have to go to work‚Äù</Title><Author>Unknown author</Author><Content>i love him</Content></post><post><Title>Have been together with my fianc√© for about five years now.

When I got there she gave me a sweet Christmas card, we hugged, and I thanked her. She was wearing dark leggings that clung to her legs tightly and a very cute, fuzzy pink sweater that she'd just gotten for Christmas.      Then, out of the blue in between words of our conversation, she leaned forward and gave me a kiss. Just a quick touching of our lips, then she leaned back upright, watching me silently with her big, beautiful blue eyes, like she was nervous about how I would react.      I couldn‚Äôt stop smiling. I leaned forward and gave her a hug and a kiss on the head, stroking her hair and telling her how sweet she was and how soft her lips were. That was my first kiss, and hers too, and it felt wonderful.      She said that it had taken a lot of courage for her to do that, but that she was glad she did. With me, of all people!      At the end of the date, we kissed twice more in her driveway before I got in the car. Another quick kiss and one slightly longer one.</Content></post><post><Title>My shy boyfriend melts with any little act of affection‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è</Title><Author>u/ThrowawayRA_1885473</Author><Content>Ughh this literally happened 15 minutes ago and I‚Äôve been gushing over it.

I‚Äôm still at my boyfriends apartment. He was wanting cuddles from me for a while but I had hw I had to do for my classes. He started playing on his Xbox and I decided I would go over and kiss him. I walked up to him and gave him a small peck on the cheek, nothing extravagant. When I moved back to look at him, he had the biggest smile on his face and was blushing a little bit. I literally melted when I saw how something so small could make him so happy. Ughh I love him sooooo much.

Here‚Äôs what I found:</Title><Author>u/ithinkyoushouldlurk</Author><Content>Tbf, we use each other‚Äôs phones all the time for googling stuff, looking up directions, etc., so we‚Äôre already in each other‚Äôs phones fairly frequently. We were friends for years before dating, so we naturally have 0 secrets from each other. I have some attachment / trust wounds from a previous (abusive) relationship and he is so patient with me. If I ever get in my head and start to worry, I can always sheepishly ask to peek through his phone. This doesn‚Äôt happen often, but it happened this past week. So, I asked him to look through it and here‚Äôs what I found:      5 photo albums. Named: ‚ÄòMy girlfriend is a Baddie ü•µ‚Äô ‚ÄòLife with the love of my life‚Äô ‚ÄòFor C‚Äôs playlist‚Äô ‚ÄòFor C‚Äôs photo album‚Äô ‚ÄòPresents for C‚Äô      4+ lists in his Notes app of gift ideas for me      10+ lists of thoughtful things to do for me while I‚Äôm out of town      Anyway.

We met as strangers on the internet. We had our first FaceTime just a day after exchanging emails. I‚Äôll never forget it. We are just 5 years apart in age.      8 months later we signed a lease on our first apartment together. It was nicer than anything either of us had ever stayed in. It was our home.      We texted everyday ‚ÄúI love you‚Äù and ‚ÄúI love you more‚Äù. It was unlike any relationship I had ever had. It felt safe, and l felt loved. Sure we have our arguments but it tore us both apart to not be connected. The arguing would end in ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry‚Äù and ‚ÄúI hate being apart from you‚Äù.      The pandemic hit and while many couples hated being locked up together, we found ways to have fun. We would shoot nerf guns at red solo cups we setup as targets. We started saving to buy a house.      Then one day I got a message through Facebook from someone who said I was being cheated on. Sure enough it was true. My heart broke. I decided to forgive and we moved on.      We got engaged, we bought our first house and took the in laws to Italy. Life was good but I had trust issues which then affected our sex life. We went to therapy but we still argued.      And then late in 2023 I get a text from another person letting me know I‚Äôve been cheated on. It was true. That‚Äôs when I ended it.      Of course I‚Äôm leaving so many details out because I don‚Äôt want this to be a longer post than it already is but I want to say this to all of you looking for love‚Ä¶      love with your whole heart. Love deep. Love is a risk and if I had the choice to do this all over again knowing how it would end, I would. But I‚Äôd still leave. True vulnerable love is the most beautiful and fullfilling feeling you can have.      don‚Äôt take any moment for granted. Looking back, I did. I assumed that we‚Äôd always have each other and I regret focusing on work so much.      no one is perfect. Own up to how you played a part in any arguments. Remember why you love each other.      And I‚Äôll leave you with this‚Ä¶you‚Äôll know if you truly loved because in the end (whether death or breakup) you‚Äôll have to pay the toll and it‚Äôs grief. And it‚Äôs deep deep grief but it‚Äôs so worth it.      Edit: to everyone telling me to get therapy, just stop. My post isn‚Äôt about asking for your help. Everyone‚Äôs journey is different and I alone made a very conscious choice to remain in my relationship. I‚Äôm not blaming anyone for my choices. That‚Äôs what being an adult is. My post left out many details for brevity sake so I‚Äôll mention here that the heavy grief is being felt on both sides. We hold each other and cry so hard some nights. Yes we still live together.

My husband is next to me currently. He has a habit of rolling over in his sleep and cuddling me. He's never aware of it nor remembers. However tonight I'm reminded of when we first met. Earlier today he mentioned that he's at peace when he's near me. And for some reason I couldn't figure out why that perplexed me.      Well just a few minutes ago I remembered when we first met. I remember when he hugged me. To comfort me. He said he was at peace and that his soul felt drawn to me even though we had just met.      I have tears rolling down my face now.  I read that that feeling can be described as "coming home". Because that means whatever he had been searching for he found in me. And whenever he drifts off he searches for me subconsciously. I do NOT deserve this man but I'm grateful for him every day.      Edit: Words cannot express how surprised and blessed I feel with everyone's stories and encouragement on here. So much so it's hard to respond to each and every one of you. Without going into too much detail, I struggle and have struggled based on my past experiences as a child and an adult.

I was feeling sad over something irrelevant and at the time I was living away from my mom in a different city. I came home and she immediately noticed. She didn‚Äôt even ask what happened the only thing she said to me was that she knew and that she was there for me      Through a clenched throat and gutted tears my mom told me that above even my dad that she felt like I was her soulmate. She told me that she felt like she waited her entire life for me to come to her and that no one else she‚Äôs ever been close to has had such a connection to her that she‚Äôs had with me      This obviously made me immediately start to cry and i told her I felt the exact same way and that I feel like we had probably been through multiple lives together  while hugged and both had tears running down our face.      I don‚Äôt know, I know it feels probably dry to type this out but I didn‚Äôt  know where to share it. Lucky me that my mom said this to me but I just feel like it goes to show, you dont always have to meet the ‚Äúright person‚Äù to find this kind of love and connection. Sometimes, they‚Äôre right there next you in your family.      This being said, going into the new year I feel so incredibly lucky to be alive and to have felt something like this in my life. I hope anyone who reads this feels loved and knows that they really are the center of someone‚Äôs universe and that there‚Äôs no definition of what a soulmate should look like.      If you love someone tell them, and make that a priority in your life no matter who it is, there‚Äôs too much hatred that exists out there otherwise. Big love going out to everyone in the new year, you deserve it more than anything else.</Content></post><post><Title>My heart breaks for anyone who lays in bed at night and wonders why they weren‚Äôt enough for the one person they would give the world to.... that shit ruins you.</Title><Author>u/aamin_00</Author><Content>No content</Content></post><post><Title>He Makes Inanimate Objects Talk Back To Me</Title><Author>u/DeusExNumia</Author><Content>Ever since I was a little kid, I've had a habit of talking to inanimate objects.  "There you are, pencil!", "Okay teakettle, I can hear you, shut up", etc.Since moving in with my boyfriend, and where we've been in quarantine forever, whenever I talk to an inanimate object, "Come on, computer, work with me here", he'll hold his mouth closed and do a silly voice and respond, "I'm trying my best, Numia, but we're all tired here".      "Thanks, doorbell!"      "You're welcome!"      It warms my heart all the way through, I love it, and him so very much.</Content></post><post><Title>Best friend and I confessed our love</Title><Author>u/luttuluttuluttu</Author><Content>I feel over whelmed.      This happened 2 days ago      I, 29M have a really close friend 29F. We've been friends since 20. We hang out most often and have sleepovers. She's kinda socially awkward and we're each other's best friend. We watch movies together, have drinks, beer mostly and share everything with each other, fight occasionally too. Even our parents mistook us for a couple, but we never imagined it in our wildest dreams.      All these times we never had any feelings to each other, at least that's what I thought and we have not dated anyone else. A year ago unexpectedly we started sleeping together, we became FWB. People say its really bad to be FWB with your best friend but in our case it dint ruin our friendship or made anything weird. Actually we sleep together and for us it was very casual, like playing a video game together.      And last month things took a turn. I went to her apartment (she's hardly 2 kilometers away) to hangout as usual and she seemed upset.      She was pregnant!      She cried to me, apologized but I tried to be a supportive friend. I dint blame her or anything cuz it's my responsibility too. Although I acted brave with her I've never slept a wink till yesterday.      Thought of having a kid terrified me (she was too). We haven't told our mum and dad yet but we're telling them tomorrow.      To the incident of today, for the last month I have been contemplating on my life till that time, about why I'm still single, why we've been sleeping together etc. At some point at night, I imagined a situation some guy marries a girl he made pregnant and suddenly I don't know why I replaced those people with us. That moment, I thought about how my life would be if we were a couple. I felt a little joy inside. I think that's how everyone feels about a person the love. I thought about all of our interactions for the last few years and it hit me hard why others took us for a couple. I was startled and felt awkward when I realised I have feelings for my best friend. I was really tensed, we're both strangers to romance and I was terribly scared to tell her.      Some thing happened an hour ago, following and someone on reddit, I talked to her, mustering all the courage I can. I thought she will freak out and we never speak to each other again.      But she wept, hugging me. She couldn't even speak properly when she said she loved me all this time, for years. I couldn't stop shedding some tears too even though I tried to look tough.      She told me she was scared sick I might reject her. Said she always dropped hints.(I swear dint even realise it.) When I told her she said, "You son of a b**ch I've been loving you for over six years"!. I could not not drop my jaw.      Anyway we promised to raise the kid together and make our relationship official and go on a date tomorrow evening. We don't know shit about dating but we are very optimistic about our future.      I don't know if there will be a marriage in the future but we sure see us together.      Edit: someone told me to asked her to write her side of the story. She agreed to post it soon</Content></post><post><Title>My girlfriend is sleep talking and it's the sweetest thing</Title><Author>u/sKaiisClear</Author><Content>My girlfriend is sleeping right beside me when I heard her say "you can't drink rain water" I said "Why?" Then she said "It's dirty" I chuckled and checked if she's asleep then she said "Don't let your dog drink rain water" so I laughed thinking it's cute that she also thinks about my pets, then she went silent and said "find it!" I asked "what?" She said "Find it!!" So I asked "Your love?" She said "Yes! Please!" So I said "But it's me" she said "No!" I got nervous and asked for a name and she said my complete full name. She then realized it was me and hugged me as tight as she could. I find it very sweet and it seems like a pretty simple reminder that I have someone who really loves me. I'm so lucky to have her in my life and I couldn't imagine living another day without her.</Content></post><post><Title>A random girl kissed me out of nowhere today. Im in shock.</Title><Author>u/EffectLive97</Author><Content>I was picking up some food from a store for doordash. As I was walking to the door, she told me that she liked my shirt (it‚Äôs a doordash shirt). She said that she hopes they don‚Äôt make me wait long. I said thanks and went to pick up the order.      It took about 15 minutes for me to get the food, but when I came out she said ‚ÄúI knew they were going to make you wait!‚Äù I think I just laughed and walked away. Idk.      Then she calls out to me and says ‚Äúhey, would a hug make you feel better‚Äù I was fine so I‚Äôm not sure what she meant but I told her she could if she wanted to. Then we hugged and before she walked away, she gave me a kiss on the neck and said something about getting more tips.      Now this wasn‚Äôt like a sloppy love making kiss, it was more like a quick peck. But it literally didn‚Äôt make sense what happened. I‚Äôm not good looking, I‚Äôm not fit, I don‚Äôt stand out. Only thing I can think of is that maybe she was drunk. But it was the middle of the day so I‚Äôm not sure.      All I know is that I was BRICKED for the next half hour, also that it made me feel like someone wanted me. I was stressing over some shit that happened earlier and that just blew everything away.      I know this reads as a ‚Äúand then every one clapped‚Äù story but I don‚Äôt care.

We are in the middle of planning a wedding, and I‚Äôve had a really bad situation with a coworker being inappropriate. It‚Äôs been a really stressful time. The stress hasn‚Äôt made me the funnest person to be around and we‚Äôve had some bigger than normal arguments.      I‚Äôm not used to people being willing to put in work in a relationship. I‚Äôve been left a lot. I‚Äôve been afraid he would leave me with everything going on. We closed on our house on Wednesday, and due to a clerical error his name got left off all the documents. We have to go back in six weeks and pay a 200 dollar fee to add his name to the house. He could leave me at anytime because currently, he‚Äôs free and clear. I‚Äôm the only one stuck.      We don‚Äôt have any furniture yet. We have been sleeping on the floor. It hurts his back and he‚Äôs been saying how uncomfortable sleeping on the floor is. So. ....We borrowed an air mattress from a friend. It‚Äôs SMOL. I‚Äôm used to sleeping on the floor. I lived in my car for a year. It‚Äôs not the most comfortable. But I can tolerate it pretty well. I let him sleep on the air mattress last night because I wanted him to be comfortable. Or bed is supposed to get delivered Monday.      This morning, I woke up with him next to me on the floor. Snuggled up against my back. He said he couldn‚Äôt wait until Monday to sleep next to me. He slept on the floor just to cuddle me.  I‚Äôm full of doubts and insecurities but he always seems to make them better. I cried this morning when he said that. We may be going through an extremely stressful time right now but I love him and he loves me. I slept on the floor so he could be comfortable. He slept on the floor because he wasn‚Äôt comfortable without me.      We both slept on the floor last night.</Content></post><post><Title>Set up a 3 second timer and came out with my favorite photo of our sweet baby girl!

I've always loved him but lately I feel like I'm just head over heels for him like when we were younger. My stomach gets butterflies and I almost feel sick just from thinking about him, like the jitters you get before you meet up with a new boyfriend. When we are in a room together I can feel the electricity between us almost like a magnet just pulling us together. During Thanksgiving I couldn't help looking at him from across the room and doing little things to catch his attention. I think he feels it too, as he's been very vocal about wanting me and any chance he gets he'll come up and touch me or kiss me. He's always been more affectionate than me but lately it's been taken up several notches. I've caught him several times staring at me, checking me out, and looking love struck. Complimenting and asking why I'm moving a certain way and why I'm teasing him when to me I'm just going about doing my normal chores. I don't know what's going on with us but I hope this feeling stays.</Content></post><post><Title>Does anyone cuddle with their pillow (or stuffed animal) in bed and pretend it‚Äôs their significant other?</Title><Author>Unknown author</Author><Content>I sometimes kiss, hug, cuddle, hump the stuffed animal or pillow pretending its them.

A little backstory- I told her I have aspirations to join the navy, and when I do, I'll be away for a while, and then after seeing her for a little bit after Bootcamp, I'll be on active duty for 4 years and will only see her every now and again when she comes out to visit or I go home on saved up leave.      As she spoke through the tears, she said she didn't want me to go and that she loved me so much. I just held her for what seemed like forever and I just rocked her back and forth on my lap for over an hour as she cried and I consoled her.      I loved this girl more than anything. We just cuddled until her sobs turned into smiles and I told her I was going to marry her someday (we have talked about this before) she just smiled and hugged me.      And Jesus, you best believe me when I tell you this girl is the most stunning thing you could ever see.

And they don‚Äôt like themselves, because they base their self-worth onyour approval and what you think of them! It's cyclical.      You‚Äôre disappointed in your performance, because you learned from others‚Äô disappointment in you. And,since you want their approval, you take on their disapproval.Why do you give someone else the power to decide how you choose to feel about yourself? You do that when you make them the source of your self-love.  You were raised to believe your emotions come from outside of you (i.e. your circumstances and other people).So you believe you have to work hard to change your circumstances, so you can change your emotions. And you believe you have to earn stuff to impress other people, so then both people and circumstances can give you your emotions (i.e. feeling loved, worthy, supported, accepted and appreciated).      But when you remember thatyour emotions come from your thoughts,then you remember that you have the power and freedom to feel better whenever you want, and eventually feel good enough.      ~ BFree      .

Ive had feelings for this friend for a while now and I did ask her to be my gf but she said if we‚Äôre still single by 30 she‚Äôll date me. I‚Äôm not sure how to take that but I‚Äôm trying to see the positives out of it. Back to the dream I started in the middle of the dream so it was ambiguous on whether or not the child was mine but my friend had pretty much become my wife. The unexplainable happiness I felt being there with her raising a child was amazing but eventually it was revealed the child wasn‚Äôt mine and the father had come back into my friends life. And my friend just left me and went on to raise her child with the father. It felt like part of my life had been taken away from me. My son and my wife were just gone. I woke up and realized of course that it was just a sad dream but all of those emotions I felt are still there I remember the joy of living as a family and the heartbreak of losing that. It feels like there‚Äôs a hole in my heart  and it‚Äôs driving me insane. Every time I have a moment to think I just feel so alone it‚Äôs like my brain just wants to go back to that feeling of bliss even though I‚Äôm not really ready for that kind of relationship.

I feel like love means something different for everyone</Title><Author>u/mark_98</Author><Content>I feel like each person has a different definition of Love.  What one says and the other hears can be 2 different messages.      I thought I was in love because of the "energy" I felt from my last partner.  Skin to skin contact made us feel like 1 soul, in my mind.  Being around her felt great.  When she was happy I felt it.  When she hurt I felt it. She lied a lot, gas lit, cheated.  I made many mistakes too, but after she admitted some things I believe I was not acting like myself because I was always on the edge.  Regardless, the emotional connection I had, and still have, is like nothing else I experienced with any woman.  I met her at 30 and had been with plenty women before hand.  Breaking up with her 1 year ago has almost destroyed me.      We both are in therapy, separately, but had some contact again recently.  I feel myself wanting to return.  I cannot imagine that feeling being replicated.  I am worried that it is just fear about life.  I feel as I have no purpose, passion, or desire.  I just want a life with her.  Even if that means a difficult one.      The rationale part of me says I will just be hurt again.      Married men I know do not share these feelings that I bring up.

Ugh I‚Äôm still gushing over the date I had with my shy friend earlier today. We‚Äôre both 20F and 20M      Some backstory, I‚Äôve known him since around February. I met him in one of my classes and I could instantly tell he was shy/introverted/a little awkward which didn‚Äôt bother me. I started talking to him originally about the class and the worksheets we had but then it switched to different things like some things we enjoy.      Well since about the beginning of may, I started to catch feelings for him. I know it‚Äôs taken him that long to open up by I feel like that‚Äôs a big part of my initial crush for him. I‚Äôve seen him open up to me from hiding in his shell all the time to coming out and showing me his true self. I feel so special knowing I‚Äôm one of the only people on this planet who can see who this shy, sweet, intelligent guy really is. It was around that time that I started to realize what a hidden gem I had discovered.      So a couple months go by, my crush seemingly getting bigger with each passing day. Until I finally decided to just go and ask him out on a date. Nothing special or fancy, it was just us two at Dave and busters. Even his reaction was adorable! When I asked him, his cheeks flushed red and he had a smile on that he couldn‚Äôt wipe off.      Everything went amazingly well during the date! I dressed in a nice pair of jeans and a nice shirt which got another cute reaction out of him. He blushed when he saw me and was a little speechless because he‚Äôd never seen me dressed up.      We got some food to eat and we played a bunch of games throughout the store until we headed back home. I held his hand as we walked back to the valet. Again he blushed, smiled, and gave my hand a little squeeze. I seriously can‚Äôt get enough of his reactions to doing little things like when I kissed him goodbye, It was like a computer resetting with tons of blushing cheeksü•∞.      He actually told me I was special to him because of the date and also the fact that I was the only person who decided to stick around and watch him come out of his shell and open up to someone. He likes that I‚Äôd invite him to go eat somewhere or hangout after class made a difference to him which is why around mid-April he started having feelings for me too.      Ugh I seriously can‚Äôt get enough of that boy and how the smallest sign of affection will make him all happy and blush. It makes me feel special too because my previous partners wouldn‚Äôt care for those little acts of affection where it makes his week if I kiss him. ü•∞ü•∞ I‚Äôm just so happy right now üòä</Content></post><post><Title>My fiance keeps hyping me up about my new (terrible) mustache, and it's adorable.</Title><Author>u/LaszloKravensworth</Author><Content>She (30f) felt the unimpressive wisp of a mustache a few nights ago as I was kissing her good night (I work nightshift) and when she noticed it you'd have thought I had disrobed for the first time in front of her.  She was "Oooo"ing and "Ahhh"ing as though I had presented her with fine jewelry.      Y'all this mustache is NOT hot.  To make matters worse, it's in the fledgling stage where it hasn't yet hit puberty and blossomed into a facial feature.  Yet she keeps coming up and touching it and getting all flirty and authentically complimenting it.  She's actually reverse-gaslighted me into thinking it looks good.      I think she knew I'd be self conscious about it and is going overboard in trying to make me feel good about it.  We both know it ISN'T a good mustache, but she's 22 weeks pregnant so I've gotten good at hyping her up about her appearance, too.  I wonder if she's returning the favor.

Yes, that was a Futurama reference.</Title><Author>u/BikerJedi</Author><Content>I've been married to a big, beautiful sassy woman for 28 years. Together for 30. Our anniversary was this past weekend. We haven't had the ability to do anything fancy for a while, but this year I had the money to do something nice. Since I had the means, why wait for a "special" number like 30?      Step one: "Hey babe, wanna get a hotel downtown and eat out for our anniversary?"      Step two: Make other plans. (Cue evil laugh)      The day of, I had our son drop us off. We got checked in to a great room with a wonderful view. Watched some TV and got frisky. (Bow-chicka-wow-wow) Took a nap. At the appointed time for my master plan, we got dressed and walked downstairs after I confirmed everyone was there via text.      Everyone wasn't.      I walked her downstairs to our "reservation" for dinner. We walked across the street to the gazebo on the town square. As we walked up, she saw our family there. (At least, those that live here.) My mom and dad, who she really loves, my sister and her family and our aunt. And a stranger.      "What did you do?"      "I dunno what you are talking about."      Then my two kids (eventually) walked up with a dozen long stem roses I had them pick up earlier. (They were delayed by traffic. We had an uncomfortable silence while we waited for them and my wife wondered what was going on.) I gave a short speech about how I loved her, and I'd be honored if she would re-marry me and handed her the roses. She broke down crying. Success! I do my best to make her cry with happiness on a regular basis. Romance yo.      The stranger was a fellow teacher who was also a pastor. He did a great job and we had a wonderful ceremony. Today I showed my students pictures from the ceremony and talked about it and they loved it. My wife loved it. Everything was great.      But the thing is, later that night I tripped HARD on a sidewalk curb. I would have broken the big toe on my left foot had I not been wearing boots and a kilt. As it is, I jammed the toenail hard, and it is bruised all to hell and bleeding. I'll probably lose it. That caused to me to fall. Now, I'd had a few drinks, but I wasn't hammered. Still, I fell HARD onto my fucking face. Broke my expensive eyeglasses. Gave myself my eighth concussion, badly skinned up my knee and it hurts like hell on the bone, hurt my elbow, both shoulders. Huge black eye. scrapes on my face. Fucking hell.      Thankfully a very kind man helped me up and I made it back to the hotel.

As the weeks went on I will say it was like Pandora‚Äôs box I must say. Feelings I‚Äôve suppressed for awhile have slowly come back, which is good! I have opened up to family and friends again which has felt liberating. but now I will say that I have slowly been thinking about my Ex more in light of these admissions that had held me back for so long.      It‚Äôs a complicated situation between us if I am honest and I must admit I am scared again. I believe it‚Äôs too late on my end as it has honestly been awhile. I would also be scared to admit any feelings still as i still feel they are suppressed a bit and i also am so scared that I may hurt her as it destroyed me to hurt her the first time, as that was someone i loved so much at the time it literally broke me when i did it.      The good news is i am aware of these feelings and instead of pushing them down i am attempting to shift through them. Thanks for reading!</Content></post><post><Title>BF completely blew my mind by kissing me hard during a fight and I felt like I was in a movie</Title><Author>u/missjeri</Author><Content>So my BF of 7 years and I were in a pretty big fight the other night about something relatively stupid, but we're both stubborn so we let it snowball. We hadn't seen each other in a couple days but had been fighting mainly over the phone, and the next time we saw each other it was with a group of people, so we didn't really get a chance to air it out in person until later that night. When we were finally alone and he got into my bedroom, I sighed and closed the door, ready to hash it out with him. Really give him a piece of my mind, yknow? I took off my jacket though and he just stared at me and my cute outfit, took off his glasses, then came up and kissed me so passionately I nearly melted into the floor. He basically told me he was sorry but he couldn't stop himself because I looked so good and he loved and missed me.      Guys. Guys. Honestly despite rehearsing what I was going to say to him beforehand, I completely forgot my whole speech. I completely forgot what the dumb fight was even about. Hell I'm pretty sure for a while there, I completely forgot my own name. I think I blacked out for a bit because my heart was beating so fast. I felt like freaking anastasia steele when she was kissed in that elevator (fifty shades is a terrible movie but that scene was hot af).      And because we don't really like having sex without fixing our issues, we managed to keep our hands off eachother for long enough to laugh about what a stupid fight we were having and to really discuss it all. He triple checked with me that I was okay with everything before proceeding to blow my mind again...if you know what I mean. Can't believe how lucky I am that we're this in love after being together for 7 years.  :)</Content></post><post><Title>I can‚Äôt fathom the thought of not marrying this man.</Title><Author>u/hrhashley</Author><Content>Maybe it‚Äôs my age - I‚Äôm 32, and I really want to have it all: marriage, kids, pets, maybe even a house. Maybe it‚Äôs because I‚Äôve never dated anyone who gets me the way he does. I‚Äôve never dated anyone who sees me at my lowest points and encourages me to keep going. I‚Äôve never dated anyone who makes every night feel like a sleepover with my best friend and makes every day feel magical in the smallest ways.      In the grand scheme of life, we haven‚Äôt been dating that long. A year as of Mothers Day. We‚Äôve talked about marriage but we both have debts and other mountains to climb before it becomes anything more than dreamy late night talks.      But the thing is, I met this man years ago. We were both in our early 20s and we met at the bus station by chance through a mutual friend. Over the next decade, we‚Äôd occasionally chat on Facebook messenger or on Discord. We‚Äôd play games together. Then we‚Äôd go without talking for years until one day out of the blue we‚Äôd fall back into the same rhythm.      He asked me out once before the time I said yes in 2023. I ghosted him at the time because I had too many things going on and mentally I couldn‚Äôt even handle the thought of dating. Most would have given up. He came back again in 2023 and asked me out again, except this time, I said yes. And my life has never been the same.      So maybe it‚Äôs the unshakable thought that this feels like fate, or because this is the only person who ever has looked at me and has seen ALL of me and has laughed and loved me all the same, but I can‚Äôt fathom the thought of not marrying this man. I cant close my eyes and picture a future without him in it. And I just had to get this off of my chest because more and more I fall so deeply in love and I lay beside him every night in bed and hope he feels the same.</Content></post><post><Title>Being the person watching your partner fall out of love is traumatizing</Title><Author>u/thecrazydeviant</Author><Content>My boyfriend and I broke up today. He said he was falling out of love with me, and he doesn't think he'll ever be in the same mental state to love me again. I asked if he was willing to go to couples therapy or therapy in general. He doesn't think anything will help.      To be honest, there were signs. He became distant. We would still have good chats, but he rarely initiated physical intimacy (hugs, kisses). He would rarely initiate sex either. He told me, at one point, he was trying to avoid me.      It hurts. It hurts being the person who still has so much love to work and fight for the relationship, but not getting any of that back. It hurts not being able to grow old with him, to grow with him, to face any challenges with him. It hurts watching him pull away, and me playing it off as tiredness.      I hate feeling this way. It feels like a rug was pulled under me. It's hard to fight back the tears.  ETA: Thank you for your support and kind comments. I've read through all of your responses and am glad to see I'm not the only one going through this. I never expected us to go through this journey, from strangers to lovers to strangers again. He says he doesn't see a future with me, and I still don't understand how this suddenly happened.I wish I could say I hate him, but I don't. I love him and I want him to be happy. Despite all of this, he still deserves the world. I wish I could be part of his happiness because I would have done anything to stand by him.ETA2: Wow. I didn't realize how many people resonated with this story. I didn't think this would blow up the way that it did. For those who are hurting, I hope you are getting the help and support you need. We'll get through it.

He kept making these adorable noises while he breathed calmly, and I‚Äôm just in awe at how much love I feel for him all the time.

In fact, your so-called love also has nothing to do with love.      These are beautiful words which you use without knowing what.they mean, without experiencing what they mean. You go on using the word 'love'. You use it so much that you forget the fact that you have not experienced it yet. That is one of the dangers of using such beautiful words: 'God', 'love', NIRVANA, 'prayer' beautiful words. You go on using them, you go on repeating them, and by and by, the very repetition makes you feel as if you know.      What do you know about love? If you know anything about love, jealousy is never present in love. And wherever jealousy is present, love is not present.      Jealousy is not part of love, jealousy is part of possessiveness. Possessiveness has nothing to do with love. You want to possess. Through possession you feel strong: your territory is bigger. And if somebody else tries to trespass on your territory, you are angry. Or if somebody has a bigger house than your house, you are jealous. Of if somebody tries to dispossess you of your property, you are jealous and angry.      If you love, jealousy is impossible; it is not possible at all.      Jealousy has nothing to do with love. If you love your woman, how can you be jealous? If you love your man, how can you be jealous? If your woman is laughing with somebody else, how can you be jealous? You will be happy: it is your woman who is happy; her happiness is your happiness. How can you think against her happiness?      But look, watch. It is happening everywhere, in every family. The wife even becomes jealous of the newspaper if the husband goes on reading it too much. She comes and snatches it away: she becomes jealous. The newspaper is substituting for her. While she is present, how dare you read your newspaper? That is an insult! When she is there you have to be possessed by her totally not even a newspaper... The newspaper becomes a competitor.      So what to say about human beings? If the wife is present, and the husband starts talking to another woman and looks a little happy - which is natural: people get tired of each other; anything new and one feels a little thrilled - now the wife is angry. You can know well that if a couple is going by and the man looks sad, then he is the husband married to that woman. If he looks happy, he is not married to the woman. She is not HIS wife.      You are not really in love with your woman, or with your man, or with your friend. If you are in love, then his or her happiness is your happiness. If you are in love, then you will not create any possessiveness.      Love is capable of giving total freedom. ONLY love is capable of giving total freedom. And if freedom is not given, then it is something else, not love. It is a certain type of egoistic trip.      You have a beautiful woman. You want to show everybody, all around the town, that you have a beautiful woman - just like a possession. Just as when you have a car and you are into your car, you want everybody to know that nobody has such a beautiful car. The same is the case with your woman. You bring diamonds for her, but not out of love. She is a decoration for your ego. You carry her from one club to another, but she has to remain clinging to you and go on showing that she belongs to you. Any infringement of your right and you are angry - you can kill the woman... whom you think you love.      There is great ego working everywhere. We want people to be like things. We possess them like things, we reduce persons into things. The same is the attitude about things also.      That is the mind - continuously in competition. Now he is doing circumcision; he has to do something. That is the way we are living: the way of the ego. The ego knows no love, the ego knows no friendship, the ego knows no compassion. The ego is aggression, violence.      Jealousy never follow love as a shadow.      Never.      Love makes no shadow at all. Love is so transparent that it makes no shadow. Love is not a solid thing, it is transparency. No shadow is created out of love. Love is the only phenomenon on the earth which creates no shadow.</Content></post><post><Title>I married the love of my life that I met on Xbox live</Title><Author>u/SpecialKay1a</Author><Content>No content</Content></post><post><Title>Is love supposed to make you nervous?

Neither of us have real support in life (them less than me especially...) so as I've recently seen them get hurt in their relationship multiple times and know that both of us struggle with self-love, wanting to genuinely tell them their worth has been gnawing away at me recently because I had always assumed their partner was that source of comfort for them.      They don't know it, but in the short time of connecting and learning about each other they've helped me gain a lot of confidence and growth in being myself and in tackling life and I feel like I'd be letting them down as a friend if I didn't express this in a more honest and emotional way to them BECAUSE I know they struggle with all of the same things that I do so its harder to ignore the pain they go through.      I personally know how self-doubt makes us not believe in the things people say to us. So I want to be open heartedly genuine because I know how strong of an impact that can have on a person and hopefully it connects with them but don't want to come across as a "white knight" swooping in an opportunity, yknow.      I know that most people would treat opening up so emotionally as having alterior motives and although I know they'd be less likely to see that...if I come across the wrong way and all of a sudden our past connections lose all trust in being genuine and just seem like a ploy to be close to them I'd legitimately be heartbroken.</Content></post><post><Title>I forgot that relationships are supposed to make you feel better about yourself.</Title><Author>u/gxzzymo</Author><Content>I spent six years with somebody who was the least affectionate, least willing to compromise person I‚Äôve ever met. He didn‚Äôt touch me. He didn‚Äôt cuddle me or hold my hand. I counted once and he kissed me twice in one month. He rarely told me he loved me. We went on dates maybe once every few months, and he‚Äôd complain the whole time. Begging for the absolute bare minimum for years from the person who claims to be in love with you does horrible things to your self esteem, and I didn‚Äôt even realize it until I got out of it.      Now I‚Äôm with someone else, a man that I‚Äôve been best friends with for five years. Whereas my ex wouldn‚Äôt even tell me he loved me, this man constantly tells other people how in love with me he is. My ex never wanted to hold my hand, but I never get in a car with this man wherein he doesn‚Äôt hold my hand. I get told I‚Äôm pretty constantly. My ex used to complain about going to dinner or the movies; this man has asked to take me into the city for dinner and a symphony, to have sex with me on a hotel balcony overlooking the beach, to take me out to California to show me things he saw on his visit years ago. I get good morning texts. Every door I ever approach is opened for me. I told him once what my dream engagement ring would be while we were both absolutely plastered, and the next day when we‚Äôd sobered up he listed off everything I‚Äôd said I liked. If I even mention I might like it, he‚Äôs already bought it for me. He checks and changes my oil because he knows I‚Äôll never remember to do it myself and never lets me go to work without caffeine because he knows I‚Äôll have a headache. I‚Äôm so taken care of.      I forgot what it feels like to have a relationship that makes you feel better. I‚Äôm smiling for no reason. Coworkers have commented on it. I feel prettier. I try harder. My house is cleaner. I have a generally better attitude. I‚Äôm sleeping better. I am so fucking STOKED to be in this relationship.      I have to marry him. He‚Äôs it. I just know it.</Content></post><post><Title>Raised with more hate than love, never cared or felt anything for relationships. Do I learn to embrace love or forget about it?</Title><Author>u/DalinsiaValkyrPrime</Author><Content>I‚Äôve made a post before. There I also spoke about how I never felt anything for anyone, how all the relationships I‚Äôve ever seen were toxic to varying degrees, and other things I can‚Äôt recall right now.      However, as the title states‚Ä¶ there was more hate as I grew up. My mother still feels guilty that she didn‚Äôt leave and somewhat encouraged my father‚Äôs behavior towards me. Through that, I really only learned that I should use one emotion.      Rage.      That rage only pushed people (who I was already isolated by) away. I hardly had any friends and was ostracized by practically everyone as I grew up. It‚Äôs kind of hard to imagine love then. I did many physical outbursts on myself, passing out once from a blind rage. The scars are shameful, but very small in number compared to my others.      Now, I just wonder what it feels like. I‚Äôve heard it is peace, fulfilling, wonderful, etc. Is that what it really is? I know love isn‚Äôt easy, but neither is the toll of hate and anger on the body. Even though I like being by myself a lot, just being capable of feeling something would be enough. I‚Äôve heard the ‚Äúhate takes more energy than love‚Äù, but then you would have to call me the mitochondria.      I‚Äôve been in therapy. Coming up on 6 years. Different therapists, different methods, but I just see it as worthless. Paying the price of a motorcycle in total over the years for what feels like a simple conversation. It feels pathetic, as if I need to pay to talk to someone. I actually have an appointment today in the next hour.      I‚Äôve even been hit on multiple times recently, but I didn‚Äôt find it flattering. I found it annoying, irritating, and (sounds horrible) disgusting. I want to learn how it can be genuine and flattering.      I never had feelings and don‚Äôt think I can, so I don‚Äôt even know if that‚Äôs a possibility. Might be better off though. If I‚Äôm being honest, there are aspects of romantic/sexual love that I find somewhat repulsive.      What should I push myself towards. The majority of myself that is just saying ‚Äúdo you really think love is a key component to life? You can live without it.‚Äù While the minority part of my mindset is ‚ÄúEven if it‚Äôs just once, open your heart to love. Yes, you don‚Äôt NEED it to live, but it can certainly be a step for you to take.‚Äù      It‚Äôs confusing and I don‚Äôt know what to do.</Content></post><post><Title>I got my bf an award on one of his comments on reddit and he doesn‚Äôt know it was me.</Title><Author>u/ThrowRA_CloseFriend1</Author><Content>He sent a really giddy and adorable message to thank the person who gave him the award.

The car drive there was around two days, and we saw lots of sights and enjoyed every moment of it.      My favorite memory was when we where in the middle of the desert on an empty road. All we ahead of us was pitch black and the tail light. After hours of talking and listening to music,  I start to fall asleep in the passenger seat but wake up shortly after to him singing to songs I had no idea he was interested in, word for word. I pretended to still be asleep because seeing him happy made me feel happy inside.      An hour later he pulls up to a hotel, got all our stuff into a room and then came to me. He still had no idea I was awake (I think) and he carried me between his arms to the room. He was struggling but it was still super cute! He lied me down, tucked me in, and kissed me on my forehead. After that, I he fell right into the bed next to me, with all his clothes still on . I kept staring at him the whole night.      When I woke up my heart was filled. I went to cuddle him and he acted so confused to why I was so happy. Looking back at it, he probably did know I was awake, but I didn't want to ruin it. :)</Content></post><post><Title>I don't know what to do, how to feel, or if I should be crying as hard as I am right now</Title><Author>u/StarLight_Art</Author><Content>Me and my boyfriend have been together for 4 months, but I've known him for three years. Me and him haven't had a ton of rockyness other than when he comes to me about his mental health. He is the kind that blocks people out of his life to deal with it on his own, and I'm the kind of person who wants to talk about everything, be open and find a solution. On many accounts he has told me he might break up with me, because the battles he is fighting in his head are getting to be to much, and I tell him the same thing I can tell him. "I love you so much, and I don't want you to leave me. But if it helps you, and you can feel better by doing this I'm in full support. I know you are hurting, and we can try a break if you would like, I just want you to know I'm here to listen to anything that's going on in your mind."      Usual he ends up telling me it's fine, and he just needs to think about everything. He has been adamant on when school gets out he will make the decision if we need to take a break, or break up. And because we have a week left, I've been crying a ton. Fearing the man I have loved for so so long is going to leave me. And I know it's not my fault and I know this is to benefit him in every way, I just don't know what I'd do without him. He is my everything and I love him so much. I don't want to see him and begin to break down. I've cried Infront of him three times and one of those times was to tell me about this situation I'm in. Walked up to him and just staired at the floor. Thinking don't cry don't cry don't cry. But he pulled me into him, and held me, whispered in my ear to let it out. And I bawled. Hard. Loud hard, in the middle of a school hallway.      I'm not dependant on him by any means, I don't need his attention all the time but he truly is my rock. 4 months of dating with a year of pent up love hurts when it's ripped away from you..I just want him to get better, i want him to be okay, i want us to stay together. But I have no control over that now, and I'll I need to do is be there for him, and hope and pray for him      Please give me any advice you think I need from this post. Weather it's something to keep me from crying or something to better understand that it's not my fault. I don't know right now, I'm writing this and crying hard in my bedroom.</Content></post><post><Title>My boyfriend went above and beyond taking care of me when I was sick, even after we had a huge fight.</Title><Author>u/noodlepooodle</Author><Content>I don‚Äôt really know who else to share this with, but I just really wanted to tell someone about this.      Friday evening my boyfriend and I got into a huge, huge fight that ended with me leaving in tears. No yelling, no verbal abuse, nothing. Just very emotional.      I must have caught a stomach bug or ate something bad, because Friday night til Saturday evening, I was vomiting my guts out. I literally couldn‚Äôt move a muscle without having to puke.      I texted my boyfriend that I was feeling awful and he immediately rushed over with medicine. He built me a little bed next to the toilet, rushed out for some stomach safe food, held my hand while I shivered with a fever. He swaddled me when I was freezing, held ice to my head when I was burning up. He ran out to grab some stomach safe food again and gave me ice chips.      I wanted to apologize for my part in our fight and he just stroked my hair and said everything was okay. I asked him if he was mad and he said no, he was just worried about me. And that he would always love and support me, no matter what.      I have never felt so supported in my entire life. So completely accepted and fully and deeply loved. It‚Äôs nice, knowing that I have someone who is in my corner unconditionally.</Content></post><post><Title>Anyone else out there straight their whole lives then suddenly fell for the same sex?</Title><Author>u/Fabulous-Bandicoot40</Author><Content>I (37f) have always dated and been attracted to men, but not as intensely as people around me seemed to be. With most guys I dated I could take sex or leave it, except like 2 who I bonded emotionally quite deeply with then did enjoy sex with them. I almost thought I was borderline asexual or demisexual or something.      I have lots of close female friends whom I love but have never had any attraction to them at all. Even ones I know are conventionally beautiful.      Recently, I randomly met a woman (straight, married but has confessed to having crushes on women in the past) and we spent a lot of time together over the span of a few weeks and I fell hard. I considered myself a slow burn and told potential partners it takes me a long time to be comfortable with intimacy, but this hit like a semi truck. I‚Äôm now reevaluating my whole life, what this means for my sexuality, and what I will be looking for moving forward. Just wondering if people in similar situations could share their experiences.</Content></post><post><Title>The best relationships happen when you aren't looking for one</Title><Author>u/Jo_chan9</Author><Content>When I met my now boyfriend it was about 3 months after my breakup with my first boyfriend who I've been with for 1,5 years.      I was really happy to not be in a relationship anymore and didn't want or need a significant other, I was just happy with my friends and my hobbies. Also I just have been recovering from months of daily anxiety and bad panic attacks and I struggled a lot with eating and didn't eat enough.      When I met him, everything happened just so naturally. In the beginning I just thought: maybe we'll be friends. I didn't even want any romantic thoughts in my head.      But with the time passing and us spending a lot of time together (almost every day), I more and more noticed that he actually was exactly the person I have always been wishing for to be in my life. He is really smart, we laugh about the same stuff, we both like learning new things and gaming, the list goes on... but especially emotionally we're just so similar which is really important to me.      In addition, after meeting him and spending a lot of time with him, my anxiety became even less and when I was around him I had almost no more problems eating. I felt he was really good for me.      After one month of knowing each other, he kissed me and after 3 months we officially got together as a couple and I am really happy with him because he makes me a better person.      Sorry for this long and chaotic post, but what I wanted to tell you guys, is that it's more likely to find love if you don't actually look for or pressure it and just let the things happen naturally.      And Liebling, if you read this, I love you &amp;lt;3</Content></post><post><Title>I don‚Äôt know what to do and I feel really sad about it</Title><Author>u/HelpMyHead12</Author><Content>i don't really know how or where to start. i also don't really know what i'm asking for. i guess i'm just venting, but i'm open to suggestions, thoughts, or just a different perspective. my boyfriend and i are both 26, having met at 16 and begun dating 5 months after meeting online, so this year will be our 10 year anniversary. we went to different high schools, lived in different towns, went to different colleges, we've seen each other (mainly me) through a lot. from the outside, i think our relationship looks perfect. at our core, we are bestfriends. our favorite things to do are go for diet coke runs, take walks, try new restaurant spots, drive to look at christmas lights, you know the mundane things in life. recently i've felt this immense pressure to take our relationship to the next level which would be getting an apartment. however, my boyfriend is still very much finding his footing in the real world in terms of a stable and realistic job. for about half of our relationship, he's been working a job that has horrible hours (nights and weekends) which has made hanging out hard, but not impossible. i've just gotten used to him not being around for parties, work events, day trips, sadly. anyway, now after a long road of exploring options, he's in a program to become certified in something he's interested in, so i'm happy for him. in another few weeks, we will be able to rekindle saturday mornings and random weekday afternoons. i do wonder if this will be big for our quality time. but, with him switching roles, i don't know when he'll be financially ready to take the next steps of getting an apartment. but i know i can't have it both ways. either he's miserable at his current job while he makes a salary but can't spend much time with me, or train to do something else he'll ultimately like and allow us more time together but he may not be financially stable just yet. with that said, i've been feeling the pressures of all the things that make us different. we're different political parties, different religions, i'm more outspoken, he's more passive, i'm messier, he's cleaner. i feel like we've both developed this habit of thinking the other person should check every single box of what the other one wants or expects, so we bicker a lot, at least recently. when this happens we both usually get very defensive and put a wall up but once we realize what we're doing we generally are quite good at communicating properly. but sometimes it just feels like we're always bickering, or always problem solving, always figuring out more effective ways to continue staying together. sometimes this really messes with my head because recently i've been wondering if the grass is greener on the other side... with someone else would it be easier if we were both outspoken and didn't need to have conversations one whose religion is being compromised on when we have kids? idk. i've never questioned our relationship before but i've gotten into this weird headspace as of the last few weeks of feeling like one foot is out and one foot is in which is really hurtful when i've always prided my boyfriend and myself on being entirely committed to one another and "making it work" and "figuring it out." is this normal life stuff? or is my gut telling me it's not destined to work between us? surely any relationship is going to struggle sometimes. i just feel weird. i feel worried that once we live together i'm going to have to tip-toe around his need for things to be a certain way or else he'll judge me for being too messy. how can we know if we'll be good together if we don't live together yet? at the end of the day, i try to picture myself on my wedding day and i don't know how to picture it. is it him? is it someone else? is this anxiety? is this a sign? i feel so upset that i don't know. i sometimes wonder if it would be easier to decipher some of these things if i had more experience with dating other men to have more of a comparison, but i think i just got lucky on my first try. the idea of dating other people feels both terrifying yet exciting, but then i think about how when i'm sad all i want is my boyfriend because he's my bestfriend. or when i have good news, i want to share it with him. our families get along well. he always puts me on the inside of the sidewalk and walks me to the passenger side of the car and makes sure no one kidnaps me, but yet i'm upset he doesn't call me beautiful enough. i convince myself he doesn't like the way i look but instead he's just gotten used to me. why am i only thinking about the negatives and the things that separate us? why do i only focus on the problems we have? would it be different or would i feel more sure with someone else? i don't know if i want to break up to figure that out but am i missing out by staying here? am i messing out on life? i feel so unsure on what feels right right now. no one teaches you how to be an adult. this is really hard and confusing. i'm also unsure if i'm making this more complicated than it really needs to be.</Content></post><post><Title>So are you asking me?</Title><Author>u/katsinou</Author><Content>So my partner (27F) and I (23M) decided to take a much needed day trip. We went to an art gallery and it was a great unwind from our busy WFH schedules.      We then went to a pier near the art gallery, staring at the city across from. We started talking about our future plans and how grateful we are to have each other.      She then brought up marriage (which we have talked about before) and I jokingly asked her ‚Äúso are you asking me to get married this time!?‚Äù      Just as I finished asking, we made eye contact, which is when I realized there was a little box in front of my face.      Turns out, she was asking me! Inside the box was an engagement ring that her sister designed! I was in shock, out of words, but the happiest I have been in a long time.      We went for dinner afterwards as I was still processing what just happened. I love her so much and am now happily engaged.</Content></post><post><Title>What does true love feel like to you? Emotionally and physically experiencing it</Title><Author>u/FunkyTanuki18</Author><Content>Here‚Äôs my personal experience with it-      It‚Äôs been 9 months and I feel like I‚Äôm still in the honeymoon phase with my boyfriend. It feels like my heart is constantly warm and full of fireworks every time I think of him. We have to be long distance right now and when he left I sobbed for 3 hours. Every sniff of his cologne, picture of his face, and cuddle on his hoodie makes me cry. I dream about him all the time. He still gives me butterflies and makes me blush. I go absolutely feral for his smell and his voice. I love his ‚Äúflaws.‚Äù I could listen to him talk about anything forever. His mere presence makes me feel at peace. Even the most mundane things are made more EnJoyable with him. I‚Äôd protect his smile with my life. I have unending respect for him. I was prepared to wait 3 years to be with him and now I‚Äôm gonna be crossing oceans to. It hasn‚Äôt been all sunshine and rainbows but we‚Äôve made a commitment to a long relationship and treat each other with love and respect.      I‚Äôve never believed in soulmates but the day I met him I thought ‚Äúthis feels RIGHT‚Äù and I knew I‚Äôd regret ever letting him go. He makes me feel feelings I‚Äôve never felt, not even for previous partners or anyone else. I‚Äôve had other boyfriends, I‚Äôve had honeymoon phases, but never like this. It‚Äôs like my brain, heart, and body are picking up on whatever he‚Äôs putting down and telling me ‚Äúhell yeah this is a match!‚Äù Just wow</Content></post><post><Title>My boyfriend brushed my hair</Title><Author>u/popdart31</Author><Content>I‚Äôve had my hair up in buns and pony tails since I haven‚Äôt had to do my hair to go out because of quarantine lately. I was going to redo my pony tail before we started making dinner together so I took my hair all the way down but then my boyfriend asked me if he could brush my hair because it‚Äôs been knotty and tangled since I haven‚Äôt been brushing it haha. I said yes and he got his brush and asked me to sit down and very gently started to part and brush all my hair. I don‚Äôt know why but I was sitting on the bed and he was standing and I just leaned into him and he kind of cradled my face with his arm against his chest and just brushed my hair out smooth. It was so nice and comforting and I just felt so loved and taken care of. It almost made me cry it was so sweet and loving, I‚Äôm very lucky.  It took about 15 minutes because I have very thick hair  and he worked extra softly to get my knots out. Just wanted to share this sweet moment that shocked me with how lovely it felt. I hope everyone can find someone who will take the time just to do the little things:)</Content></post><post><Title>Did anybody struggle to find a s/o because they weren't up to today's standards?

I would have cried myself to sleep but  instead I took your advice, celebrated myself by popping popcorn and watching a movie&amp;amp;later BBT. Fell asleep in the middle of doing so and woke up to more messages! I had one friend reach out, a former classmate and the security guard from my former university via Facebook.

I did not reply to him because i got upset but when I did, he was worried if I was okay.      Now, he was already scheduled for operation and he still was able to ask how i was, how was my stomach cause i got sick in the past and he was checking if it came back but the catch is he is the patient and with a broken bone, he is supposedly the one to be asked. I did tell him that. He also told me to check up on him before and after the surgery which I did and I got so exhausted after. I spent all my efforts to be motivational, caring and he did thank me and was very sweet on the messages, but I grew cold after the surgery.      I just got so tired of the emotional neediness and I'm not an emotional person. I just did that to help him. I know he also helped me for about 4 months always taking care of me and always asking me how i am and giving tips how to be well and visiting me in the hospital but I just find that I am already emotionally exhausted.      I feel sometimes like we both are treating each other emotionally as that of a partner's but the catch is he already has a partner. So i wonder why is it that I am always the one he goes to when everything is not well with him?      Right now, he seems to have noticed that i am growing cold but I can't help it. He seems to be asking a huge emotional support from me and also acting like he has emotional investment on me. Imagine he is the patient and is scheduled for surgery but he still ask how was my stomach? I really don't know what to think but I want to save the bond we have, the problem is that once I remove the barriers, he will go again and emotionally attach to me.</Content></post><post><Title>She remembered a small thing I told her and used it the next time we met</Title><Author>u/deeplysimpin</Author><Content>So I'm a guy who's very physically affectionate. I love cuddles, holding hands, hugs and kisses and everything. I get very clingy when I see her and I always want to be in some sort of physical contact with her as it makes me feel secure and comfy. Like holding hands or just touching legs under the table. I told her this once while we were talking and I didn't wanna sound weird so I changed the topic soon after because I don't wanna seem over clingy. So the next time we went on a date, I got kinda nervous in between and she offered to hold hands. She said she remembered when I told her that I like being in contact. I got overwhelmed with emotions, small things like that really make me feel better. She's the most amazing person ever and I hope I can be her dream guy one day because she is my dream girl. From there on out, every date or party we've met at she offers to hold hands when she feels I'm zoning out or getting anxious. It means so much to me. Thank you M.

From someone you made feel "loved".</Title><Author>u/whocareslol521</Author><Content>When I first met you, I was broken, I was skeptical of why you were calling me out for lunch after an exam. I've never had anyone, ever, not my parents, not my brother, not my "friends". My childhood, my teenage, were so painful, I had grown up deprived of anything even remotely affectionate, I was never seen as a person by anyone, but an object, someone to use and throw away. But you, it's as if you saw everything about me, you just knew what I needed even when you had no idea about what my life had been like. You saw me as a person, you treated me differently than others, you seemed more, affectionate. You painted my nails, the first time you did that was the first time I felt safe, as if you'd protect me from anything. You brought me coffee when I was sick, ditching your friends at a restaurant, I felt cared for, for the first time in my life. You asked me if you could hug me, because somehow you knew that I'm uncomfortable with hugs. You knew that I had these horrific illnesses I suffer from, and yet you were by my side. The way you held my hand, the way you looked into my eyes, the way you just made me feel "loved", something that's so strange to me. Your birthday was coming up, I got you a film camera and let's just say I was very broke for a long time, I had also painted you something, both of which you never got. I don't get why what happened, happened. You broke off all contact on a random evening, as if a switch was flipped. You said you had a lot on your plate and I respected your boundaries, but you never contacted me again. When I asked you why, you said that I changed, which I really didn't believe. I told you about my feelings, and asked you if you once shared them too, which you denied. Was I too late to confess my feelings? I don't know, we had only known each for three months or so. I think about you, all the time. I dream of you, about what could have been. I lost my ability to trust, I lost my ability to be vulnerable around anyone, no one made me the way you made me feel. It's almost been three years, every poem, every song I write is about you, it's scares me that I'll stop seeing you as college ends. Even if I never looked at you in lectures, I acknowledged your presence, I knew you were doing well. I'll have one last look at you soon, I'll acknowledge your presence one more time, I'll try my best not to cry.      I love you, my moonlight.</Content></post><post><Title>The love of my life says she checks this sub every night to help her fall asleep</Title><Author>u/TinyHeadBigHeart</Author><Content>Yesterday my best friend texted me saying that she goes through the top posts on this sub at night because it helps her fall asleep. I think that alone should say something about how sweet she is. This girl means the entire world to me. It never ceases to amaze me how she can be so talented, hard working, and high achieving, and yet never fail to be humble and see the value in every person. She‚Äôs fearless, open-minded, goofy, and beautiful. I haven‚Äôt known her for that long ‚Äî only four years ‚Äî but I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôd do without her.

To give you a summary: I saw her at the start of the semester and she didn‚Äôt leave my head but during the exam preparation I saw her almost every day and my feelings got stronger. This was last semester. I was thinking about her very much and I slept and woke up dreaming about her. I never in my life had this type of feelings for a girl.      Couple of days ago I was brought in a situation where I had to confess to her, what the exact circumstances were at this moment don‚Äôt really matter, but I actually wanted to wait more until telling her.      She told me she also thought about me but that she is not ready for a relationship because she had a serious breakup 1 year ago and that she wants to wait.      I never experienced something like this and I don‚Äôt think my feelings will change soon. The most what hurts me is to know that she under normal circumstances would consider going into a relationship.      Should I try to avoid seeing her or should I learn to handle my feelings even in her presence? It may sound weird, but even if she‚Äôs just in the same place I feel different.      Should I maybe try to study somewhere else the next 2-3 weeks to sort my thoughts and feelings?

It‚Äôs truly exceptional that I find him sleeping outside of bedtime. He isn‚Äôt a coffee person either, he just grits his teeth through any tiredness and carries on.      But when he‚Äôs with me, he falls asleep rather soundly. When we cuddle, I can see the slow blinking, his breathing starts to calm down and next thing I know, he‚Äôs asleep.      He always says ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre just too comfy!‚Äù or ‚ÄúI just feel so relaxed!". He will vehemently deny all the sleepy allegations, even when he‚Äôs outright snoring he will say he‚Äôs just resting his eyes.      I think it is absolutely sweet. I never feel like my time is wasted if he falls asleep when he‚Äôs with me. I know it‚Äôs a truly special thing.

We were friends all through college and decided to pursue a relationship after I opened my big mouth and blurted out that I had feelings for him. Best decision I‚Äôve made so far, by far.      The other night we were snuggling and watching tv and I was laying behind him with my arm under his pillow and my head against his back. At one point I fell asleep and when I woke up he had scooted forward so my hand was right next to his face and he was resting his head in the palm of my hand just giving little tiny kisses to my fingers and the palm of my hand while watching tv. It was the cutest thing ever and I don‚Äôt even think he realized he was doing it which made it even cuter. I loved it so much that I just laid there and didn‚Äôt move and pretended I was still asleep because I didn‚Äôt want him to be embarrassed and stop!!      It makes me sooooo happy to see him be lovey dovey and vulnerable with me because so many men have a hard time expressing their feelings and he had a hard time with it for such a long time and he doesn‚Äôt really open up 100% to anyone, but he seems to be coming around to me. I absolutely adore him and I can‚Äôt wait to spend my whole life getting little hand kisses from him.</Content></post><post><Title>I cannot emphasize enough how much I ADORE my brother‚Äôs fianc√© &amp;amp; high school sweetheart</Title><Author>u/foolish_frog</Author><Content>My brother is engaged to his high school sweetheart. They‚Äôve been together for about a decade at this point. I‚Äôve always liked her, but we‚Äôve never been TOO close. We‚Äôre always super friendly when we see each other though.      Recently, my brother and I happened to move pretty close to each other, so we‚Äôre spending more time together. He just graduated college, and invited me to come see him get his diploma. Of COURSE! I had to go and support him and take pictures for our mom.      I got to spend more one-on-one time with his fianc√© than usual, and I was just struck with how much I appreciate her. She is always so excited and supportive of him. She has been there for him through a lot of his personal struggles, and it just makes me so happy that he has so much support in his corner. I know that with her in the picture, I never have to worry about him. I‚Äôm going to be giving a speech at their wedding, and I have no idea how to begin without crying.      She and I have also just been talking more, and she is such a delight. And also, can we get some appreciation for our NURSES??? They do such hard work and do not get the support they deserve! I had no idea just how much they did until I heard some of her work stories</Content></post><post><Title>Me and my girlfriend have a way of knowing how the other feels just by saying 'wife check' or 'hubby check' and then the other replies with a number from 1 to 10.

Against any reason?</Title><Author>u/pretendHappy00</Author><Content>Maybe the question seems too obvious, but let me explain here. I have a personal experience of falling in love with a person who can never be mine. It was not entirely romantic neither platonic, more than a friendship but she &amp;amp; I can never be lovers. We met at the wrong time.      Tho, I knew it already, I didn't have any expectations from her side. Just we clicked with each other, that's all. All I wanted was to talk friendly without being strangers or forcing to shut our emotions. After one and half years, she said she loves me too. Within that one and half years (still ongoing) we both were tested in a very brutal way. Sometimes she cut me off, sometimes I cut her off. Sometimes we both agreed to stay away. Sometimes we put boundaries. It was hell of a stressful period for both of us and more or less neither of us was wrong. Whatever we forced to do, in a week or two or maybe in a month or two, we come more closer. It just happens. No matter what happens, no matter whatever the reasons against us, we always come closer and closer.      It is painful to love someone you can't have. But I enjoy that smallest moment we share. I still do. It does a lot of damage. But I still can't let her go.      Why is this?</Content></post><post><Title>My boyfriend always sits next to me when we go out to eat for dates, and it makes me gush every-time</Title><Author>u/Lily-Lights</Author><Content>We‚Äôve been together for almost 2 years now, and on our 5th date I mentioned how I‚Äôd like to sit shoulder to shoulder instead of face to face.      He begrudgingly did it at first, stating that it didn‚Äôt make much sense to him. I used the excuse that it was easier to share food, but I really just liked being next to him. And ever since then his default was to sit next to me, without me even mentioning or asking for it. The waiter would put two menus across from each other, and he would just slide the menus next to each other and sit beside me so nonchalantly.      It makes me melt every-time he does that. We would even sit next to each other with an extremely tiny table.      To be honest, he probably doesn‚Äôt realize all the small things he does that mean so much to me. I remember everything he‚Äôs ever done for me, and small moments like these make me so happy.</Content></post><post><Title>Friday, I'm in love...! TELL US ABOUT YOUR CRUSHES &amp;amp; DATES!

Life just happens in a way you never expect. But, I have also noticed that she‚Äôd been enjoying the things she used to less and less. She‚Äôs really been struggling with her mental health and while I found her a therapist and encouraged her to see friends and do new things it wasn‚Äôt really helping. She‚Äôs been unsure of what she wants to do in life, and I‚Äôve just been encouraging her to pursue her interests whatever they may be but even so she‚Äôs still just been so sad.      She ended talking to me after the breakup and telling me why she left me, that she‚Äôd been putting so much of her own self worth and existence on the fact that I loved her. That she‚Äôd been pushing herself to the limit just to try to have me constantly love her so she could feel like she mattered. That despite the fact that I wanted to put her first and to have her focus on herself she never could because she thought she would be letting me down in some way. I think I cried harder than I have in years. While her leaving me is devastating, I also see the woman I fell in love with through the talk. She‚Äôs such a fiercely strong and emotionally intelligent person and that she has been able to recognize this and made this decision, even though it was hard for her, makes me so proud. I‚Äôm so happy she can take this step for herself and I truly hope she can find herself again, but if the talk was any indication then I think the woman I love will be just fine.      While I am immensely sad that I lost someone I thought I had a forever with, I‚Äôd be so much more sad if she stayed with me at her own expense. I think I just love her more for doing this for herself, even if it‚Äôs not meant to be for now, or ever. She will always hold such an important place in my heart, she taught me so much and I loved her in every moment. I do hope that I might one day have another chance with her, however, even if not I‚Äôll be okay, just knowing she‚Äôs doing better and is happy is more than enough for me.</Content></post><post><Title>I wrote this with tears in my eyes at midnight after we got off the phone. Here's to you, Lovebug.</Title><Author>u/Affectionate_Drop500</Author><Content>I don't know what I did that made me deserve you. I sit and look at our photos every day and I just get so full of happiness. How did I get so lucky? How did I find a woman who has literally everything I look for? You've got a giant heart. You've got an incredible mind. You're talented, intelligent, motivated, accomplished and driven to keep climbing. It's one of my favorite things about you. And to top that all off with a body that fits mine perfectly and is literally my idea of female perfection, this still doesn't seem real to me sometimes.      I never thought I'd be worthy of love again, much less the love of someone like you. I've never been this happy with anyone. I never thought I'd ever get close to feeling this way about someone else in my life. I have NEVER fallen this hard for someone so soon even in my best condition, let alone the state I'm in now. You've opened me up to a whole new world. You help me realize who I really am, and that I'm not what all the toxic people in my life have said I am.      You make me a better man every day. And I want to be the best man for you that I could ever be. I know I'm not perfect. I know I can be frustrating and I know I can be over the top and my emotions are so intense. But the way you handle me with such grace and care and REAL love, there's nothing in the world that could ever feel as good as your love makes me feel.      I love you so much. I never thought I'd say those words to someone again. I didn't think I was capable of it. But you, oh it just had to be you. You've awakened something in me that I've never felt before. I thought I was sure before. But I've NEVER been this sure of anything else in my life. Not by a long shot.      Our compatibility is a genuine anomaly to me. I've never been on such a synchronized wavelength with someone before you. I always had to struggle to make things work and I did it through brute force. But loving you is like breathing. It's the most intuitive, natural thing and it flows from me like water; I couldn't stop loving you no matter how hard I try.      I owe you the world. You have my heart and soul for as long as you want to keep it. I hope you want to keep it forever. You deserve everything you ever want and I'm so lucky that I get to be the man who gives it to you.      Some days, when I'm alone, I fear that you don't feel the same, and that I may be too much for you. But then I see you, and there's not a shred of doubt in my mind that you love me just as much.      You are incredible and we are incredible together. I'm so excited for things to grow even stronger between us. I can't wait to build with you, to lives our lives together and keep motivating and building eachother up. No passengers, just true partners.      You were always it. I just had to meet you to find out.      I love you so much, sweet pea.</Content></post><post><Title>tldr; my boyfriend named himself after a mouse</Title><Author>Unknown author</Author><Content>so my boyfriend is asian, specifically Chinese. and when he was younger, he had a Chinese name, given to him by his mother and father.      now i didn‚Äôt find this particularly alarming. because i too, am Asian and was born with a Chinese name as well.      i asked him some simple questions about his name at first:      did you ever get teased in school for your Chinese name?      did you ever hate your Chinese name?      was it tedious to always write out your Chinese name on forms and papers?      etc.      and lastly, (the most important question), what made you change your name to Jerry instead? (an english name). why didn‚Äôt you keep your Chinese name?      AND THEN HE PROCEEDED TO SAY THE CUTEST THING ON PLANET EARTH      he told me as a child, he watched a lot of Tom &amp;amp; Jerry, so naturally, he named himself after Jerry, the mouse.

Whenever I'm afraid, i look at his picture and i calm down or I call him to calm down when i have anxiety and I'm very happy when around him. I compare everyone to him and they all fall short. I get disappointed that the other people around me are as not as talkative as he is or funny as he is.      But, when we see each other, we keep on fighting or arguing. Then, i instantly hate him lol. I get really annoyed easily by him but when everything feels heavy, i go to him and instantly all feels lighter. He's an avoidant but when with me he mentioned once he can't help but care for me. Sometimes, he does disappear, I'm hurt a bit but I just think that everything happens for a reason and then he comes back lol. I sometimes wonder if it's just a really great great friendship or maybe I like him or both. Sometimes he acts like my boyfriend and is too caring.      I fly to his city every 2 months because I'll miss him by then. I've been talking to others but I just seem to not be as invested.      I sometimes think we are meant to be and he also said that because we seem to really just disappear on people who are interested in us. So, i have an inkling we will end up together because of how crazy we are. We both cry and are vulnerable with each other and can be our 100% self with each other. We've already traveled with us only together      With others, i have to hold back my attitude but with him, he likes it. He even sees my great potential and worth. He mentioned I was special to him.      Why do i feel that with him, i can do anything and can calm down?</Content></post><post><Title>My boyfriend took off my make-up while we were both drunk af and it was the sweetest thing ever</Title><Author>u/suspicious_sushi</Author><Content>My boyfriend is the sweetest person ever and his daily efforts to show affection and appreciation are so precious to me!

He immediately started to play with like it was a gun and told me he loved it.      Later I told my roommates about it and I said "I don't know if I'm a good girlfriend for knowing he'd like the stick, or he's a good boyfriend for appreciating the thought anyways." As we were chatting about it, he texted me about how happy the stick made him.      We're in our late 20s and he makes me as playful and enthusiastic as a little kid.

I am addressing this letter to you, yet I have no idea who you are or where you are. It's nearly evening, and I imagine you might be coming from the office, studying for your dream job, or outside your home as you watch kids play, others walk, and just watch this beautiful world unfold. I hope that when we meet, we start to like each other, talk, and look forward to our next meeting. Every moment apart, we feel like we are in our dreams, and when we meet each other, we pinch ourselves and try to console ourselves if it's really happening. I hope, over time, we fall in love with each other with all our perfections and imperfections.      I don't know what will happen after that. To be frank, life is rarely fair, and difficulties bound all of us. However, I know it will take the universe to tear us apart. I would be standing side by side, and we together would be sailing the sea of life, stormy or sunny. I would thus love you unconditionally without any constraints or strings, and the love would be as pure as it could bring someone to tears. I really can't wait to meet you, to care for you more than I do, to share every moment of my life, and to begin being a participant in everything you want me to be, be it late-night movies, going on vacations, or just hearing you rant about how her day had been. I can't wait to see you in bed and think how lucky I am in the world to get someone like her to share her life as you sleep.      I'm just running out of adjectives to describe how our love would be endless and expanding, like the universe we inhabit. It's such a privilege to fall in true love with you, and I can't wait to fall in love with you. One day, I hope, as you wake up from bed and we do breakfast, looking forward to the day, I show you this letter and ask whether you think our love is like what I hoped for in the letter, and you unequivocally say yes, hugging me as we both cry silent tears of joy and comfort.      Yours forever</Content></post><post><Title>My boyfriend doesn't drink coffee</Title><Author>Unknown author</Author><Content>My boyfriend doesn't drink coffee. I try not to, these days, since I have nowhere to go and nothing to get up for. His routines aren't really affected by this quarantine, he never liked leaving the house anyhow. I'm more social, I want to be outside, do new things, meet people, and I've been miserable walled-up, sometimes far more than I realise.      Yesterday he asked me if I'm feeling alright, and I said I have a headache I guess. He asked if it's coffee withdrawal, since he hasn't seen me drink any recently, and I said it shouldn't be, since it's been days.      Today I woke up to him awkwardly clunking around the coffee machine. He doesn't know how to use it. He doesn't drink coffee, he's never made any, but he figured he'd make me coffee.      He's also started doing something he's never done before - playing some online team playing videogames with his friend he hadn't really spent much time with. I'm guessing the friend is also a more active person, and he's quarantined too, so my boyfriend is keeping him company, chatting with the headphones while they play.      Some people love in such silent ways, you have to stop and listen.</Content></post><post><Title>How do I respond to being called cute to a girl who isn‚Äôt really shy?</Title><Author>u/swift_carrot</Author><Content>I have been talking to this girl who‚Äôs really nice and I think I like her a lot and she calls me cute quite a lot and I just say thank you but I feel guilty because I don‚Äôt know a complementary word as I‚Äôm very shy but I‚Äôm not sure how to explain fully like people expect a man should be more confident and she‚Äôs taking a more leading role in this if that makes sense. I really want to find a word because otherwise I feel bad just saying thanks all the time and not returning the favour and me feeling thankful would just lose its meaning it feels like to me.

I ended up replacing my blankets and pillows with his because I missed him so bad. Well, turns out I really love his pillow, lol. It‚Äôs the only pillow I‚Äôve ever used that doesn‚Äôt hurt my ear or shoulder when sleeping on it. Unfortunately, I have no idea what brand it is since the tag is old enough it‚Äôs just sold white.      Now that we live together, I‚Äôll playfully steal his pillow and cuddle it refusing to give it back. Tonight he tickled me until I let go and then he sat the pillow smack dab in the middle of the bed. He pulled me to him and assigned the left half to me. I said, ‚Äúit‚Äôs okay, cutie. I can sleep with my pillow.‚Äù He refused and asked me to stay sleeping on his. All night, we snuggled and I slept so well. I needed to vent a little because I had tears coming out of my eyes last night from being so happy.      Sometimes I don‚Äôt think he realizes how much the little things he does means to me, but he never goes unappreciated. I never thought I‚Äôd fall in love, but I fell so deep. Meeting him was the best thing that‚Äôs ever happened to me. üíú</Content></post><post><Title>Life love or something like it. Is it worth it? I don't know anymore</Title><Author>u/One_Adeptness_7610</Author><Content>Life is life. One minute it's great and next it's not. The character Forest Gump was somewhat acute when he referred to life being like a box of chocolates. Not a bad metaphor but one has to remember there's a lot of crappy chocolates out there. For those who are interested in the back story I suggest you look into my previous posts. A lot more of this will mank sense. As one may guess they don't show a shining example of life. At least not my life in its current state.      Four and a half months ago my wife of ten years left. She told me she "needed some space". This happened on December 31st. It made a new year's eve to remember. If only I could forget. The next day I drove her to her son's house an hour away and we parted company. On February 12th she left for an area 900 km away. She intended to be there for a month but as far as I know she's still there now. Throughout the entire time (since January 1st) we continued to talk via text and phone calls until late April. For a while it looked like things were slowly getting better and reconciliation was going to happen. I suppose they were perceptions of a hopeful heart.      Towards the end of April she started to talk about friendship and how it's important in a relationship. I agree it is important. I both strongly feel one needs to have a close friendship with their spouse to have a loving relationship and marriage. She then mentioned I need to be open to love again. Even if it wasn't with her. I wasn't sure what she was meaning when she said it but I believe I do now.      She also talked about personal growth (hers and mine) and how we're talking now but she didn't want to give me "false hope" of a rekindle. She didn't want to dangle a carrot. She said she just needed more time. I told her if we were to reconcile it would be a slow process of beginning again from the start and it would be hard to know what would happen as we're both different people now. She agreed with me on it all. Keep in mind I still love her deeply. I know she still loves me even though it's buried just under the surface of her current feelings.      Generally these are all great signs but this is what caught my attention. When talking about friendship and being open to loving again and not wanting to give false hope she eluded to (didn't say anything outright) her moving back into the house where we could live as roommates. And if I or her were to meet someone... She didn't say any of this directly but made a few references to this sort of living arrangement. Hearing it all bothered me and I told her this wasn't a six week fling in high school and I have to be in math class with you/her. We had a marriage and I wasn't interested at all in being downgraded to "friends".      Love can't just be turned off. Maybe for some but not me.      Once I figured out what she was trying to get me to agree to I told her I think it's unhealthy for us to continue talking. She said she was confused and thought I was doing great emotionally but respected my decision to end contact. We parted company with her saying to "take care of myself". I said the same. There was no more for the rest of the day. I reflected on our conversation for the rest of the day and evening. I was still thinking about it when I woke up the next morning. I felt things weren't fully clear for either of us.      Early the next morning I sent her a message to call me when she was ready. She did a few hours later. When we spoke she was sheepish and soft in her communication. She'd often been cold and hard before. I told her I believed our continued talking was hindering her personal growth and mine. She didn't say anything about it but said she wasn't ready to have me gone from her life yet. "Yet"... What does that mean? I didn't ask and I'm not sure I want to know. Was she using me (and my sons) to ween her off of us? I don't know but I its possible.      We talked about my sons and life's happenings for a while. She talked about not having any idea of what she wanted now or later. Not even knowing what she was going to make for lunch. Normally she knew and planned for things several days or weeks or even months in advance. This indecisiveness was something somewhat new. I first noticed this behavior about and a half year ago.      After a while I redirected the conversation back to our communication. I said we could do one of three things. We could continue on talking the way we have been but I didn't believe it was at all helpful for either of us. She said nothing. Or we could pick up talking a lot more to where she responded with not being ready for that yet. ("Yet". What does that mean?) Or we could stop talking altogether and maybe sometime again in the future after a few weeks. She was noticeable bothered by this suggestion but agreed it was probably best. She said the love for one another is there but it's the in love part that is in question. I didn't agree or disagree. I noticed that after the decision was made she kept reaching for topics to keep our conversation going. We ended our phone call with us both saying "bye for now". Two days later she sent a picture showing it was snowing where she was. I didn't respond.      It's now been almost three weeks since we talked. It's been difficult. It feels like the break up has happened all over again. I'm 50 years old. I'll be 51 in July. I've had more than my fill of this emotional pain and I just want it to end. I want peace.      I know she'll be back at some point but I don't know when. My fear is that I'll have to go through all this again for a third time and it may just be a lot harder      Tdlr: I have no idea what to do or think or even say anymore.</Content></post><post><Title>Self love is so important.

Do you think feelings towards someone are even something that we can fully control? Have an influence over?      Let say for an example that there are two identical twins, that behave the same toward you - how come you will end up turning more toward one than another? Because I don't think our feelings toward someone fully depend on what other person does because if it did, we would stop having feelings for them a second after they do something bad to does, when they reject us or similar.      If we had a control over them, why wouldn't we be able to just turn them on or off as we would like?</Content></post><post><Title>Do you also feel incredibly happy when you make your significant other happy?</Title><Author>u/sokuto_desu</Author><Content>When you take care of your SO, gift something to them, make them smile, etc.?

I thought being thousands of miles away would help, but there is no flight I can take to get me out of my own head. There is not a single place on this Earth that can provide me an escape from my thoughts.      It feels as though we had made progress yet remained stagnant. I hate to feel like I‚Äôve been manipulated all this time and that you never felt the same way. The hardest truth to accept is that we never saw each other the same way. Every time I think about that, it feels as though my heart breaks again. I absolutely hate the feeling and I find myself avoiding it whenever possible. I don‚Äôt know how or when I allowed myself to get this deep emotionally, but I wish I was stricter on myself. I wish I knew when to stop and let go instead of holding on tighter.      Accepting that this is not anything you want has been extremely hard for me. You have come in and out my life, and every time I want to believe that you want to change for yourself and for me. When you say you don‚Äôt want a relationship, the ‚Äúwith me‚Äù part is silent. That hurts to think about and I‚Äôve found myself avoiding accepting that.      I‚Äôve finally been able to admit that this relationship has wounded my heart and my ego more than I ever cared to admit. I gave you so much of myself because it felt right to do and in the end it was not enough. I hate how insecure it made me, I hate how angry I‚Äôve become. It is a constant battle with my heart and mind because although my heart welcomes you with open arms, my mind doesn‚Äôt forget. It has become difficult to trust anything because I feel as though I spent so long second guessing you.      Spending time with you has set me back from moving on and I blame myself for it. I love hanging out with you. I love spending time with you. You were my best friend and my favorite person to talk to. I love laughing with you and I love being able to talk about everything under the sun with you. I could be myself with you in a way that brought out my inner child. I struggle with rejection, and to have things end up like this has been very difficult to get over. Feeling like a placeholder rather than a partner to you has been hard to get over. And despite knowing my worth, I‚Äôd be lying if I said that the pain has made it harder to remember sometimes.      Despite bringing out the best in me, this relationship has also shown me the not so good parts of me. The part that struggles to let go of my need for control in situations. The part that gets triggered by being ignored, because it makes me feel very small in the same way my mother used to make me feel. The parts of me that can be harder to love on a bad day. These are things that I pray to heal from, and I want to learn how to not let my triggers get a reaction out of me every time. Learning how to sit in my emotions until I feel like I have processed my emotions enough to confidently express them.      Our love has become a lot like the dysfunction we‚Äôre used to, even if it was unintentional. That breaks my heart more than anything because I believe we‚Äôre both better than that. We talk so much about self development and generational trauma, and it is so fucking hard to not fall into. I see so much of me in you and sometimes I see exactly where we clash. To that point, I also see why even through the chaos I felt like you were the person for me. I fear I‚Äôve done what I said I would never do again, and it is falling in love with potential. Aside from that though, I love who you are as a person. Sometimes I wish you saw yourself the way I see you. Sometimes I also wish that you could just tell me you don‚Äôt love me and you never saw this being serious, so that it makes it easier for me to move forward.      I come across these posts that talk about ‚Äúbreadcrumbing‚Äù, the concept of giving someone just enough attention so that they stick around, knowing all the while that you have no intentions of being with them. Every time I read those things, I feel my heart sink a little bit because I find that it comes too close to our own relationship. It is emotional manipulation and to realize that you are capable of this has been hard to accept. I have always known that there are people who are capable of it, I‚Äôve come across them many times. I just didn‚Äôt anticipate it from you. All the good moments‚Äî my favorite moments with you feel like they were shared with an entire different person. I‚Äôm realizing that maybe the person that I met and fell in love with is not the person that you are, and I keep holding onto someone that never truly existed.      I have to stop holding my breath hoping things will change with us. You are the first person in such a long, long time that I could be myself with. The way we met, I thought it was fate. I won‚Äôt ever go as far to say it was all a mistake, but it was a decision that has cost me a lot. The highs have been amazing, but the lows have been painstakingly low. I cannot allow myself to keep mourning something that was never meant to be, and has not been for some time. The good memories are exactly that‚Äî memories. And as time passes, they become more and more distant. The only thing that comforts me is knowing that I am capable of love, the love I never received, and I know that if I can do it once I can do it again.</Content></post><post><Title>My roommate and I get along a little too well and i‚Äôm trying to back off without being mean or pushing her away</Title><Author>u/Lost_You_4686</Author><Content>Hello, this is my first post here and i‚Äôve already talked to a couple friends but i think this is an interesting/slippery situation that I‚Äôm honestly still looking for advice on.      Long story as short as possible: My roommate moved in about a month ago and everything has been really chill and awesome. We hangout literally all the time, which sound obvious but we‚Äôre both gamers with our own friend groups and still choose to hang with each other instead more often than not. She is the exact type of person i would look for but I see her as just my roommate right now, i‚Äôve been very careful about getting attached and truly I don't know her enough to get attached yet. I'm the guy in the situation and don‚Äôt want to make our living situation uncomfortable.      That being said I have tried to set some boundaries and they‚Äôve either been ignored a couple of times or completely disrespected. I‚Äôm not interested in hearing about her sex life because it makes me uncomfortable, don‚Äôt even like discussing in detail with ‚Äúthe boys‚Äù but i do care about her and want to be there for her when she wants to vent. We tease each other about using the word ‚Äúwe‚Äù whenever we do in text conversations about gym, groceries, and potentially future plans. She seems to clarify things that don‚Äôt need to be clarified (if she is hooking up with people, etc) because they fall under my boundaries and because they‚Äôre not my business and i‚Äôm not sure why she would do that. I understand being comfortable with the person you live with and feeling comfortable sharing but it comes off a little differently. We‚Äôve been very clear multiple times that we are just roommates but with the other things she‚Äôs been ‚Äúclear‚Äù about and then walked back almost immediately i feel like i can‚Äôt fully trust her.      I‚Äôve been through a really bad situation-ship (3 years, multiple back and forth trips across states, and months ‚Äúon and off‚Äù) so this kind of attitude towards my boundaries really concerns me. Due to my last situation i only take girls at face value and don‚Äôt try to look deeper into the meaning of their words or ‚Äúin between the lines‚Äù I love really deeply and i don‚Äôt love anyone that isn‚Äôt there to love me and just me and I really don‚Äôt want to complicate my living situation. I‚Äôve never been in this exact kind of situation and i‚Äôm trying to figure out if i‚Äôm lying to myself about this or not and how to not mess up my living situation. I want space from her at this point but i don‚Äôt want to be mean or obtrusive about it.</Content></post><post><Title>Excuses to talk to a girl who doesn't know me</Title><Author>u/Merle_Gargulio</Author><Content>Hi everyone, I'm 16 years old and there's a girl a little younger than me that I always see in the morning on her way to school, I'll start by saying that the title is a bit fake, I don't even know how to explain it but I like interacting with girls, what I'm looking for is neither a relationship or anything like that, but simply an interaction. The sense? I don't even know, but I'd like to interact, it seems a bit maniacal, but in truth I suffer from incredible social anxiety especially with people of my age, I think it's precisely because of this that I developed this thing of interacting. Even talking to her  dealing with her for 1 minute or even less is enough for me, it would make me feel incredibly satisfied. (Don't ask any questions) But how can I do it? I thinked about  dropping some coins (Euro) so maybe she helps me pick them up and let's say a few words. Please help me, school will be over soon and I will most likely never see her again.

I'm a light sleeper so I see most of what he does, and myself, I only roll over and cuddle if I wake up.      Last night he rolled over and (I was on my side facing him) placed his head on my hip and was hugging my butt and he slept like that. When I tried to move he squeezed his arms so I wouldn't. He had no recollection of this is the morning. I just love how even asleep he seems out to cuddle me. Last night at one point he rolled over and put an arm around me and plopped his other hand on my head and patted it while out cold. I just feels good to be loved and the physical affection is sublime.

It‚Äôs still so weird to me 8 years later</Title><Author>u/guava_jam</Author><Content>Before I(32F) met my husband(33M) 8 years ago, I was made to feel like I was too clingy, too emotional, too sensitive, etc. I was never enough for the men I loved, and I always wanted too much from them. Until I met my husband.      From the start he just‚Ä¶ loved me. I was a mess back then and I tested him a lot, but he always passed with flying colors. When I asked him if he knew he was being tested he said yes, but that he understood because of everything I had been through. We‚Äôd spend hours over the weekends in bed just snuggling until I was overstimulated which was never a thing because no one ever wanted to do that with me. 8 years later it‚Äôs still the same, we can spend all day happily hanging out in bed and just getting up for food and to pee, which is our plan for this Sunday.      Sometimes my insecurities from the past creep up and last night I asked him, ‚ÄúAren‚Äôt I too much sometimes?‚Äù He responded, ‚ÄúNo. What do you mean?‚Äù And I reminded him that even I know I can still be way intense, energetic, and physically and emotionally needy sometimes and he said, ‚ÄúWell that‚Äôs you and I just love you. I don‚Äôt have to think about it harder than that.‚Äù      This morning while he was working I sent him a joke video about getting me baby Highlander cows for Valentine‚Äôs Day. Within 15 minutes he sent me info about a farm an hour away that offers private tours to feed and snuggle baby cows. I never knew this was a thing and we‚Äôve set a date to go.      I love this man so much, and I still find it so weird that he just loves me and I don‚Äôt have to play games or pretend to be anyone else. I do try to hold myself back when I know he needs time alone as we are both pretty introverted, but if ever I feel disconnected from him I just say so and he will open his arms without hesitation so I can jump in. The only time I can‚Äôt do that is when he is in a meeting lol. I don‚Äôt know how I got this lucky.

I won't go into the details because they're irrelevant, but the torment didn't stop all day. There was nothing my boyfriend could do to stop it.      At night, when I was all tucked into bed and ready to sleep, he was next to me. I was feeling so bad after having a bad day that I broke down just as we were about to fall asleep. He sat upright and I thought he was annoyed with me, that made me cry a bit more. He sat cross-legged, took me by my arm (I was facing away from him) and just said "come here" in a soft whisper.      I sat on his lap, wrapped my arms and legs around him and cried. It was a chilly night so he wrapped the blanket around the both of us and slowly rocked back and forth while rubbing my back slowly and giving me light/soft kisses here and there. At one point he whispered "cry your heart out if you want to dear, ive got you". And I did, I cried quite a bit but it was okay, he was there, rocking me back and forth gently in his embrace, reassuring me and giving me soft kisses throughout.      After I was done, I felt so much better. I was smiling and giggling a bit too. He gave me more kisses, quickly ran his fingers through my hair, smiled and tickled me too. It was such a nice feeling after crying so much that my eyes felt sore. He cuddled with me to sleep, making sure I was okay.

From someone you made feel "loved".</Title><Author>u/whocareslol521</Author><Content>When I first met you, I was broken, I was skeptical of why you were calling me out for lunch after an exam. I've never had anyone, ever, not my parents, not my brother, not my "friends". My childhood, my teenage, were so painful, I had grown up deprived of anything even remotely affectionate, I was never seen as a person by anyone, but an object, someone to use and throw away. But you, it's as if you saw everything about me, you just knew what I needed even when you had no idea about what my life had been like. You saw me as a person, you treated me differently than others, you seemed more, affectionate. You painted my nails, the first time you did that was the first time I felt safe, as if you'd protect me from anything. You brought me coffee when I was sick, ditching your friends at a restaurant, I felt cared for, for the first time in my life. You asked me if you could hug me, because somehow you knew that I'm uncomfortable with hugs. You knew that I had these horrific illnesses I suffer from, and yet you were by my side. The way you held my hand, the way you looked into my eyes, the way you just made me feel "loved", something that's so strange to me. Your birthday was coming up, I got you a film camera and let's just say I was very broke for a long time, I had also painted you something, both of which you never got. I don't get why what happened, happened. You broke off all contact on a random evening, as if a switch was flipped. You said you had a lot on your plate and I respected your boundaries, but you never contacted me again. When I asked you why, you said that I changed, which I really didn't believe. I told you about my feelings, and asked you if you once shared them too, which you denied. Was I too late to confess my feelings? I don't know, we had only known each for three months or so. I think about you, all the time. I dream of you, about what could have been. I lost my ability to trust, I lost my ability to be vulnerable around anyone, no one made me the way you made me feel. It's almost been three years, every poem, every song I write is about you, it's scares me that I'll stop seeing you as college ends. Even if I never looked at you in lectures, I acknowledged your presence, I knew you were doing well. I'll have one last look at you soon, I'll acknowledge your presence one more time, I'll try my best not to cry.      I love you, my moonlight.</Content></post><post><Title>My opinion on ‚ÄúLove‚Äù please ignore if you don‚Äôt like my opinion (I am not well qualified for it as I have been single as far as I remember)</Title><Author>u/Gurkaran0012</Author><Content>I feel like love is an emotion that can‚Äôt be explained ( Sorry for such a start) but I believe that if you love someone you should not be able to tell what you love about them‚Ä¶‚Ä¶, that sounded way better in my head so allow me to explain, if you say that you love her smile or love how she looks at you then you only love one thing about her but I believe love is more than this, it is something that should force you to think what you don‚Äôt love about the person you are in love with and never find an answer. So my point is if you can explain what you love about a person it is not love. Thanks to everyone who read this far and sorry for blabbering so much. If you didn‚Äôt catch my point dm me for more discussion on this topic.</Content></post><post><Title>How can I get over her if I see her almost everyday</Title><Author>u/No-Fly-6002</Author><Content>Hi everyone,      I made a Post in the past about a girl from my Uni that I kinda fell in love with.      To give you a summary: I saw her at the start of the semester and she didn‚Äôt leave my head but during the exam preparation I saw her almost every day and my feelings got stronger. This was last semester. I was thinking about her very much and I slept and woke up dreaming about her. I never in my life had this type of feelings for a girl.      Couple of days ago I was brought in a situation where I had to confess to her, what the exact circumstances were at this moment don‚Äôt really matter, but I actually wanted to wait more until telling her.      She told me she also thought about me but that she is not ready for a relationship because she had a serious breakup 1 year ago and that she wants to wait.      I never experienced something like this and I don‚Äôt think my feelings will change soon. The most what hurts me is to know that she under normal circumstances would consider going into a relationship.      Should I try to avoid seeing her or should I learn to handle my feelings even in her presence? It may sound weird, but even if she‚Äôs just in the same place I feel different.      Should I maybe try to study somewhere else the next 2-3 weeks to sort my thoughts and feelings?      Thank you all for your help      Edit: the weirdest thing for me is that she in the last 2 weeks kinda approached me multiple times and way more than before and should a lot of interest that she didn‚Äôt show anyone else around me</Content></post><post><Title>It's starting to feel like there is something unlovable about me, and I can't see why</Title><Author>u/Illustrious_Run_5966</Author><Content>I am 34 years old, male, I have an okay job($70k a year), I'm generally decent looking (a little overweight), funny, smart, I enjoy cooking, cuddling, going to concerts, hanging out with friends, hanging out with my teenage kids. I have been single for the last 10 years and it's definitely not like I'm not trying. Countless apps, friends trying to set me up, I just don't seem to click or even really get a chance with anyone. I've tried working on myself and besides my weight I feel like this is close to one of the best versions of me and I could very easily be someone's match. I don't want to just hook up with someone either, I really truly want to find someone I can marry, share my life with, grow with, be happy with. But, nobody wants me or seems interested in me at all. Just feeling super discouraged. I have no clue what's wrong with me, maybe I come off as too desperate.</Content></post><post><Title>How do you stay optimistic about love and relationship after breakups, heartbreak, and rejection</Title><Author>u/TaurusFae</Author><Content>I have never been in a relationship before, I don‚Äôt trust people, I push them away.

They‚Äôve been together for about a decade at this point. I‚Äôve always liked her, but we‚Äôve never been TOO close. We‚Äôre always super friendly when we see each other though.      Recently, my brother and I happened to move pretty close to each other, so we‚Äôre spending more time together. He just graduated college, and invited me to come see him get his diploma. Of COURSE! I had to go and support him and take pictures for our mom.      I got to spend more one-on-one time with his fianc√© than usual, and I was just struck with how much I appreciate her. She is always so excited and supportive of him. She has been there for him through a lot of his personal struggles, and it just makes me so happy that he has so much support in his corner. I know that with her in the picture, I never have to worry about him. I‚Äôm going to be giving a speech at their wedding, and I have no idea how to begin without crying.      She and I have also just been talking more, and she is such a delight. And also, can we get some appreciation for our NURSES??? They do such hard work and do not get the support they deserve! I had no idea just how much they did until I heard some of her work stories</Content></post><post><Title>Why do some people stick together no matter what comes in their way? Against any reason?</Title><Author>u/pretendHappy00</Author><Content>Maybe the question seems too obvious, but let me explain here. I have a personal experience of falling in love with a person who can never be mine. It was not entirely romantic neither platonic, more than a friendship but she &amp;amp; I can never be lovers. We met at the wrong time.      Tho, I knew it already, I didn't have any expectations from her side. Just we clicked with each other, that's all. All I wanted was to talk friendly without being strangers or forcing to shut our emotions. After one and half years, she said she loves me too. Within that one and half years (still ongoing) we both were tested in a very brutal way. Sometimes she cut me off, sometimes I cut her off. Sometimes we both agreed to stay away. Sometimes we put boundaries. It was hell of a stressful period for both of us and more or less neither of us was wrong. Whatever we forced to do, in a week or two or maybe in a month or two, we come more closer. It just happens. No matter what happens, no matter whatever the reasons against us, we always come closer and closer.      It is painful to love someone you can't have. But I enjoy that smallest moment we share. I still do. It does a lot of damage. But I still can't let her go.      Why is this?</Content></post><post><Title>Friday, I'm in love...! TELL US ABOUT YOUR CRUSHES &amp;amp; DATES!

Here's to you, Lovebug.</Title><Author>u/Affectionate_Drop500</Author><Content>I don't know what I did that made me deserve you. I sit and look at our photos every day and I just get so full of happiness. How did I get so lucky? How did I find a woman who has literally everything I look for? You've got a giant heart. You've got an incredible mind. You're talented, intelligent, motivated, accomplished and driven to keep climbing. It's one of my favorite things about you. And to top that all off with a body that fits mine perfectly and is literally my idea of female perfection, this still doesn't seem real to me sometimes.      I never thought I'd be worthy of love again, much less the love of someone like you. I've never been this happy with anyone. I never thought I'd ever get close to feeling this way about someone else in my life. I have NEVER fallen this hard for someone so soon even in my best condition, let alone the state I'm in now. You've opened me up to a whole new world. You help me realize who I really am, and that I'm not what all the toxic people in my life have said I am.      You make me a better man every day. And I want to be the best man for you that I could ever be. I know I'm not perfect. I know I can be frustrating and I know I can be over the top and my emotions are so intense. But the way you handle me with such grace and care and REAL love, there's nothing in the world that could ever feel as good as your love makes me feel.      I love you so much. I never thought I'd say those words to someone again. I didn't think I was capable of it. But you, oh it just had to be you. You've awakened something in me that I've never felt before. I thought I was sure before. But I've NEVER been this sure of anything else in my life. Not by a long shot.      Our compatibility is a genuine anomaly to me. I've never been on such a synchronized wavelength with someone before you. I always had to struggle to make things work and I did it through brute force. But loving you is like breathing. It's the most intuitive, natural thing and it flows from me like water; I couldn't stop loving you no matter how hard I try.      I owe you the world. You have my heart and soul for as long as you want to keep it. I hope you want to keep it forever. You deserve everything you ever want and I'm so lucky that I get to be the man who gives it to you.      Some days, when I'm alone, I fear that you don't feel the same, and that I may be too much for you. But then I see you, and there's not a shred of doubt in my mind that you love me just as much.      You are incredible and we are incredible together. I'm so excited for things to grow even stronger between us. I can't wait to build with you, to lives our lives together and keep motivating and building eachother up. No passengers, just true partners.      You were always it. I just had to meet you to find out.      I love you so much, sweet pea.</Content></post><post><Title>HE WANTS A BABY AND I'M CRYING</Title><Author>Unknown author</Author><Content>He was all cuddly and I could tell he had something to say by the excited look on his face. He started leaving soft little kisses on my stomach and told me how much he loved me. There was clearly something going on, so I asked him. He explained with this big goofy grin on his face that he really wants to be a dad and he thinks we'd have an amazing family together. It might sound like the cheesy stuff most couples talk about, but it really struck a chord with me and I started bawling. Happy tears, of course. I love this man so so so so so so SO much.

Whenever I'm afraid, i look at his picture and i calm down or I call him to calm down when i have anxiety and I'm very happy when around him. I compare everyone to him and they all fall short. I get disappointed that the other people around me are as not as talkative as he is or funny as he is.      But, when we see each other, we keep on fighting or arguing. Then, i instantly hate him lol. I get really annoyed easily by him but when everything feels heavy, i go to him and instantly all feels lighter. He's an avoidant but when with me he mentioned once he can't help but care for me. Sometimes, he does disappear, I'm hurt a bit but I just think that everything happens for a reason and then he comes back lol. I sometimes wonder if it's just a really great great friendship or maybe I like him or both. Sometimes he acts like my boyfriend and is too caring.      I fly to his city every 2 months because I'll miss him by then. I've been talking to others but I just seem to not be as invested.      I sometimes think we are meant to be and he also said that because we seem to really just disappear on people who are interested in us. So, i have an inkling we will end up together because of how crazy we are. We both cry and are vulnerable with each other and can be our 100% self with each other. We've already traveled with us only together      With others, i have to hold back my attitude but with him, he likes it. He even sees my great potential and worth. He mentioned I was special to him.      Why do i feel that with him, i can do anything and can calm down?</Content></post><post><Title>I‚Äôm about to shoot my shot guys, wish me luck</Title><Author>u/ya_boi_Joe69</Author><Content>I‚Äôm about to ask out someone I‚Äôve liked for years wish me luck I‚Äôll update when I have done it</Content></post><post><Title>it‚Äôs simple but I found this to be a rly cute interaction with my bf. we are those seats.</Title><Author>u/3ph3m3ral_light</Author><Content>No content</Content></post><post><Title>He's singing in the shower and I'm sitting here crying because I love him so much</Title><Author>u/AlostFeather</Author><Content>He's just so adorable, attentative.

I am addressing this letter to you, yet I have no idea who you are or where you are. It's nearly evening, and I imagine you might be coming from the office, studying for your dream job, or outside your home as you watch kids play, others walk, and just watch this beautiful world unfold. I hope that when we meet, we start to like each other, talk, and look forward to our next meeting. Every moment apart, we feel like we are in our dreams, and when we meet each other, we pinch ourselves and try to console ourselves if it's really happening. I hope, over time, we fall in love with each other with all our perfections and imperfections.      I don't know what will happen after that. To be frank, life is rarely fair, and difficulties bound all of us. However, I know it will take the universe to tear us apart. I would be standing side by side, and we together would be sailing the sea of life, stormy or sunny. I would thus love you unconditionally without any constraints or strings, and the love would be as pure as it could bring someone to tears. I really can't wait to meet you, to care for you more than I do, to share every moment of my life, and to begin being a participant in everything you want me to be, be it late-night movies, going on vacations, or just hearing you rant about how her day had been. I can't wait to see you in bed and think how lucky I am in the world to get someone like her to share her life as you sleep.      I'm just running out of adjectives to describe how our love would be endless and expanding, like the universe we inhabit. It's such a privilege to fall in true love with you, and I can't wait to fall in love with you. One day, I hope, as you wake up from bed and we do breakfast, looking forward to the day, I show you this letter and ask whether you think our love is like what I hoped for in the letter, and you unequivocally say yes, hugging me as we both cry silent tears of joy and comfort.      Yours forever</Content></post><post><Title>When he cuddles me in his sleep. Things he does without realizing it.</Title><Author>Unknown author</Author><Content>So my boyfriend is a wierd sleeper, he talks, sits up, chews in his sleep but he also rolls over and snuggles me in his sleep without realizing it. I'm a light sleeper so I see most of what he does, and myself, I only roll over and cuddle if I wake up.      Last night he rolled over and (I was on my side facing him) placed his head on my hip and was hugging my butt and he slept like that. When I tried to move he squeezed his arms so I wouldn't. He had no recollection of this is the morning. I just love how even asleep he seems out to cuddle me. Last night at one point he rolled over and put an arm around me and plopped his other hand on my head and patted it while out cold. I just feels good to be loved and the physical affection is sublime.

Is it worth it? I don't know anymore</Title><Author>u/One_Adeptness_7610</Author><Content>Life is life. One minute it's great and next it's not. The character Forest Gump was somewhat acute when he referred to life being like a box of chocolates. Not a bad metaphor but one has to remember there's a lot of crappy chocolates out there. For those who are interested in the back story I suggest you look into my previous posts. A lot more of this will mank sense. As one may guess they don't show a shining example of life. At least not my life in its current state.      Four and a half months ago my wife of ten years left. She told me she "needed some space". This happened on December 31st. It made a new year's eve to remember. If only I could forget. The next day I drove her to her son's house an hour away and we parted company. On February 12th she left for an area 900 km away. She intended to be there for a month but as far as I know she's still there now. Throughout the entire time (since January 1st) we continued to talk via text and phone calls until late April. For a while it looked like things were slowly getting better and reconciliation was going to happen. I suppose they were perceptions of a hopeful heart.      Towards the end of April she started to talk about friendship and how it's important in a relationship. I agree it is important. I both strongly feel one needs to have a close friendship with their spouse to have a loving relationship and marriage. She then mentioned I need to be open to love again. Even if it wasn't with her. I wasn't sure what she was meaning when she said it but I believe I do now.      She also talked about personal growth (hers and mine) and how we're talking now but she didn't want to give me "false hope" of a rekindle. She didn't want to dangle a carrot. She said she just needed more time. I told her if we were to reconcile it would be a slow process of beginning again from the start and it would be hard to know what would happen as we're both different people now. She agreed with me on it all. Keep in mind I still love her deeply. I know she still loves me even though it's buried just under the surface of her current feelings.      Generally these are all great signs but this is what caught my attention. When talking about friendship and being open to loving again and not wanting to give false hope she eluded to (didn't say anything outright) her moving back into the house where we could live as roommates. And if I or her were to meet someone... She didn't say any of this directly but made a few references to this sort of living arrangement. Hearing it all bothered me and I told her this wasn't a six week fling in high school and I have to be in math class with you/her. We had a marriage and I wasn't interested at all in being downgraded to "friends".      Love can't just be turned off. Maybe for some but not me.      Once I figured out what she was trying to get me to agree to I told her I think it's unhealthy for us to continue talking. She said she was confused and thought I was doing great emotionally but respected my decision to end contact. We parted company with her saying to "take care of myself". I said the same. There was no more for the rest of the day. I reflected on our conversation for the rest of the day and evening. I was still thinking about it when I woke up the next morning. I felt things weren't fully clear for either of us.      Early the next morning I sent her a message to call me when she was ready. She did a few hours later. When we spoke she was sheepish and soft in her communication. She'd often been cold and hard before. I told her I believed our continued talking was hindering her personal growth and mine. She didn't say anything about it but said she wasn't ready to have me gone from her life yet. "Yet"... What does that mean? I didn't ask and I'm not sure I want to know. Was she using me (and my sons) to ween her off of us? I don't know but I its possible.      We talked about my sons and life's happenings for a while. She talked about not having any idea of what she wanted now or later. Not even knowing what she was going to make for lunch. Normally she knew and planned for things several days or weeks or even months in advance. This indecisiveness was something somewhat new. I first noticed this behavior about and a half year ago.      After a while I redirected the conversation back to our communication. I said we could do one of three things. We could continue on talking the way we have been but I didn't believe it was at all helpful for either of us. She said nothing. Or we could pick up talking a lot more to where she responded with not being ready for that yet. ("Yet". What does that mean?) Or we could stop talking altogether and maybe sometime again in the future after a few weeks. She was noticeable bothered by this suggestion but agreed it was probably best. She said the love for one another is there but it's the in love part that is in question. I didn't agree or disagree. I noticed that after the decision was made she kept reaching for topics to keep our conversation going. We ended our phone call with us both saying "bye for now". Two days later she sent a picture showing it was snowing where she was. I didn't respond.      It's now been almost three weeks since we talked. It's been difficult. It feels like the break up has happened all over again. I'm 50 years old. I'll be 51 in July. I've had more than my fill of this emotional pain and I just want it to end. I want peace.      I know she'll be back at some point but I don't know when. My fear is that I'll have to go through all this again for a third time and it may just be a lot harder      Tdlr: I have no idea what to do or think or even say anymore.</Content></post><post><Title>everyday i fall more and more in love with my boyfriend</Title><Author>u/Both-Bit-4548</Author><Content>i (21f) have been dating my boyfriend (21m) for just over three years. everyday i am giddy to see him, and i literally cannot wait to see him when he/i come home from work. i still get butterflies when he hugs me and kisses me.      we have lived together for almost 3 years as well, and i thought after a while it get less exciting but it hasn‚Äôt. we had to get a new vacuum yesterday and run a bunch of boring adult errands, and it was still an amazing time because we got to do it together. i have never had as much fun doing laundry until i met him, especially waiting at shitty little laundromats to switch the washer to the dryer.      he makes the little small things so so intimate, i‚Äôll never get bored of doing boring things with him. i‚Äôm so in love with him it makes me sick!</Content></post><post><Title>To you, what is the most pure expression of love possible?</Title><Author>u/professionalwench</Author><Content>I‚Äôm sure this is a wholly subjective question, but I‚Äôm curious as to what really strikes as being the purest.

He has saved a lot of lives and has great wisdom,‚Äù he says, before eventually changing the subject from my father, a doctor.      ‚ÄúThis woman regrets leaving and wants to come back to you,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúIt is possible that she will.

Do you think feelings towards someone are even something that we can fully control? Have an influence over?      Let say for an example that there are two identical twins, that behave the same toward you - how come you will end up turning more toward one than another? Because I don't think our feelings toward someone fully depend on what other person does because if it did, we would stop having feelings for them a second after they do something bad to does, when they reject us or similar.      If we had a control over them, why wouldn't we be able to just turn them on or off as we would like?</Content></post><post><Title>My girlfriend is a force of nature, and it kinda scares me</Title><Author>u/RightAnybody972</Author><Content>She is everythingg; charming, gorgeous, smart asf, kind like a saint, creative, has silly little hobbies and somehow attracts everyone direct to her, if we wnet to some lonely place in antartica, some grouo of person would appear outta of nowhere like bugs and start a friendshio with her. We NEVER argue, if she is mad she likes to pretend she is a actor and start arguing and/or scream like some movie and impersonating the character to relieve herself, if y'all could see her doing that i'm 100% y'all would wish to us still be living in the 8th century so y'all could fight with me till death for her hand. I never get mad for anything in life, i'm more simple with mu feelings towards the nuisances of life. But what if we get older and she still loves me but she knows she shouldn't have married me? some guy could make her happier than i did and i just wasn't good enough to live up to this angel, not that i failed, but i couldn't achieve the great and fantastical life she wished as a kid.

I thought being thousands of miles away would help, but there is no flight I can take to get me out of my own head. There is not a single place on this Earth that can provide me an escape from my thoughts.      It feels as though we had made progress yet remained stagnant. I hate to feel like I‚Äôve been manipulated all this time and that you never felt the same way. The hardest truth to accept is that we never saw each other the same way. Every time I think about that, it feels as though my heart breaks again. I absolutely hate the feeling and I find myself avoiding it whenever possible. I don‚Äôt know how or when I allowed myself to get this deep emotionally, but I wish I was stricter on myself. I wish I knew when to stop and let go instead of holding on tighter.      Accepting that this is not anything you want has been extremely hard for me. You have come in and out my life, and every time I want to believe that you want to change for yourself and for me. When you say you don‚Äôt want a relationship, the ‚Äúwith me‚Äù part is silent. That hurts to think about and I‚Äôve found myself avoiding accepting that.      I‚Äôve finally been able to admit that this relationship has wounded my heart and my ego more than I ever cared to admit. I gave you so much of myself because it felt right to do and in the end it was not enough. I hate how insecure it made me, I hate how angry I‚Äôve become. It is a constant battle with my heart and mind because although my heart welcomes you with open arms, my mind doesn‚Äôt forget. It has become difficult to trust anything because I feel as though I spent so long second guessing you.      Spending time with you has set me back from moving on and I blame myself for it. I love hanging out with you. I love spending time with you. You were my best friend and my favorite person to talk to. I love laughing with you and I love being able to talk about everything under the sun with you. I could be myself with you in a way that brought out my inner child. I struggle with rejection, and to have things end up like this has been very difficult to get over. Feeling like a placeholder rather than a partner to you has been hard to get over. And despite knowing my worth, I‚Äôd be lying if I said that the pain has made it harder to remember sometimes.      Despite bringing out the best in me, this relationship has also shown me the not so good parts of me. The part that struggles to let go of my need for control in situations. The part that gets triggered by being ignored, because it makes me feel very small in the same way my mother used to make me feel. The parts of me that can be harder to love on a bad day. These are things that I pray to heal from, and I want to learn how to not let my triggers get a reaction out of me every time. Learning how to sit in my emotions until I feel like I have processed my emotions enough to confidently express them.      Our love has become a lot like the dysfunction we‚Äôre used to, even if it was unintentional. That breaks my heart more than anything because I believe we‚Äôre both better than that. We talk so much about self development and generational trauma, and it is so fucking hard to not fall into. I see so much of me in you and sometimes I see exactly where we clash. To that point, I also see why even through the chaos I felt like you were the person for me. I fear I‚Äôve done what I said I would never do again, and it is falling in love with potential. Aside from that though, I love who you are as a person. Sometimes I wish you saw yourself the way I see you. Sometimes I also wish that you could just tell me you don‚Äôt love me and you never saw this being serious, so that it makes it easier for me to move forward.      I come across these posts that talk about ‚Äúbreadcrumbing‚Äù, the concept of giving someone just enough attention so that they stick around, knowing all the while that you have no intentions of being with them. Every time I read those things, I feel my heart sink a little bit because I find that it comes too close to our own relationship. It is emotional manipulation and to realize that you are capable of this has been hard to accept. I have always known that there are people who are capable of it, I‚Äôve come across them many times. I just didn‚Äôt anticipate it from you. All the good moments‚Äî my favorite moments with you feel like they were shared with an entire different person. I‚Äôm realizing that maybe the person that I met and fell in love with is not the person that you are, and I keep holding onto someone that never truly existed.      I have to stop holding my breath hoping things will change with us. You are the first person in such a long, long time that I could be myself with. The way we met, I thought it was fate. I won‚Äôt ever go as far to say it was all a mistake, but it was a decision that has cost me a lot. The highs have been amazing, but the lows have been painstakingly low. I cannot allow myself to keep mourning something that was never meant to be, and has not been for some time. The good memories are exactly that‚Äî memories. And as time passes, they become more and more distant. The only thing that comforts me is knowing that I am capable of love, the love I never received, and I know that if I can do it once I can do it again.</Content></post><post><Title>My boyfriend called me out of the blue and said he can‚Äôt imagine being without me</Title><Author>u/puffdoodledaddy</Author><Content>We‚Äôre long distance right now and he called me while I was on a semi break at school. I told him I couldn‚Äôt talk long cause the break was about to be over and he says he just wanted to tell me something he was thinking about earlier real quick. Then he says that even though we haven‚Äôt been together very long, it feels like we‚Äôve been together forever and he can‚Äôt imagine ever not being with me. And he just thought he should tell me that.      He‚Äôs not always the most verbal about his affection for me and it meant so so much to hear that he feels that way.

Long story as short as possible: My roommate moved in about a month ago and everything has been really chill and awesome. We hangout literally all the time, which sound obvious but we‚Äôre both gamers with our own friend groups and still choose to hang with each other instead more often than not. She is the exact type of person i would look for but I see her as just my roommate right now, i‚Äôve been very careful about getting attached and truly I don't know her enough to get attached yet. I'm the guy in the situation and don‚Äôt want to make our living situation uncomfortable.      That being said I have tried to set some boundaries and they‚Äôve either been ignored a couple of times or completely disrespected. I‚Äôm not interested in hearing about her sex life because it makes me uncomfortable, don‚Äôt even like discussing in detail with ‚Äúthe boys‚Äù but i do care about her and want to be there for her when she wants to vent. We tease each other about using the word ‚Äúwe‚Äù whenever we do in text conversations about gym, groceries, and potentially future plans. She seems to clarify things that don‚Äôt need to be clarified (if she is hooking up with people, etc) because they fall under my boundaries and because they‚Äôre not my business and i‚Äôm not sure why she would do that. I understand being comfortable with the person you live with and feeling comfortable sharing but it comes off a little differently. We‚Äôve been very clear multiple times that we are just roommates but with the other things she‚Äôs been ‚Äúclear‚Äù about and then walked back almost immediately i feel like i can‚Äôt fully trust her.      I‚Äôve been through a really bad situation-ship (3 years, multiple back and forth trips across states, and months ‚Äúon and off‚Äù) so this kind of attitude towards my boundaries really concerns me. Due to my last situation i only take girls at face value and don‚Äôt try to look deeper into the meaning of their words or ‚Äúin between the lines‚Äù I love really deeply and i don‚Äôt love anyone that isn‚Äôt there to love me and just me and I really don‚Äôt want to complicate my living situation. I‚Äôve never been in this exact kind of situation and i‚Äôm trying to figure out if i‚Äôm lying to myself about this or not and how to not mess up my living situation. I want space from her at this point but i don‚Äôt want to be mean or obtrusive about it.</Content></post><post><Title>My boyfriend cried to me for the first time yesterday</Title><Author>u/emlife2</Author><Content>We‚Äôve been together for almost a year and went on our first holiday together. It‚Äôs currently a long distance relationship so this was the most amount of time we‚Äôve been together since meeting. We were both so emotional after coming back and having to be apart again that I couldn‚Äôt stop crying. Then he cried too. Although it was sad seeing him cry, I felt happy knowing he was comfortable being vulnerable with me. He isn‚Äôt a crier at all so I knew he must have been really upset.      He‚Äôs genuinely my best friend and I‚Äôm glad I have someone who has my back as much as I have theirs.

The sense? I don't even know, but I'd like to interact, it seems a bit maniacal, but in truth I suffer from incredible social anxiety especially with people of my age, I think it's precisely because of this that I developed this thing of interacting. Even talking to her  dealing with her for 1 minute or even less is enough for me, it would make me feel incredibly satisfied. (Don't ask any questions) But how can I do it? I thinked about  dropping some coins (Euro) so maybe she helps me pick them up and let's say a few words. Please help me, school will be over soon and I will most likely never see her again.

It‚Äôs still so weird to me 8 years later</Title><Author>u/guava_jam</Author><Content>Before I(32F) met my husband(33M) 8 years ago, I was made to feel like I was too clingy, too emotional, too sensitive, etc. I was never enough for the men I loved, and I always wanted too much from them. Until I met my husband.      From the start he just‚Ä¶ loved me. I was a mess back then and I tested him a lot, but he always passed with flying colors. When I asked him if he knew he was being tested he said yes, but that he understood because of everything I had been through. We‚Äôd spend hours over the weekends in bed just snuggling until I was overstimulated which was never a thing because no one ever wanted to do that with me. 8 years later it‚Äôs still the same, we can spend all day happily hanging out in bed and just getting up for food and to pee, which is our plan for this Sunday.      Sometimes my insecurities from the past creep up and last night I asked him, ‚ÄúAren‚Äôt I too much sometimes?‚Äù He responded, ‚ÄúNo. What do you mean?‚Äù And I reminded him that even I know I can still be way intense, energetic, and physically and emotionally needy sometimes and he said, ‚ÄúWell that‚Äôs you and I just love you. I don‚Äôt have to think about it harder than that.‚Äù      This morning while he was working I sent him a joke video about getting me baby Highlander cows for Valentine‚Äôs Day. Within 15 minutes he sent me info about a farm an hour away that offers private tours to feed and snuggle baby cows. I never knew this was a thing and we‚Äôve set a date to go.      I love this man so much, and I still find it so weird that he just loves me and I don‚Äôt have to play games or pretend to be anyone else. I do try to hold myself back when I know he needs time alone as we are both pretty introverted, but if ever I feel disconnected from him I just say so and he will open his arms without hesitation so I can jump in. The only time I can‚Äôt do that is when he is in a meeting lol. I don‚Äôt know how I got this lucky.

I just took the hint more seriously right now because he is asking for emotional support from me when he underwent an operation and said to contact him before and after to check on him.      It wasn't a simple motivation. I had to show my caring side and we promise to eat out together after. I said I cant wait to him getting better and he said he cant wait to eat a lot. There was more and it was really intimate, sort of a life and death situation and there was us trying to defy it.He also updated me when the surgery will be finish.      He literally copied the same situation when I was in the hospital and also need to undergo an operation, he also was my emotional support back then but the difference is I didn't ask him to check on me. He just did. Although i did message him that I got hospitalized.      I think this all started when he constantly became my "rescuer" when I got sick and always checked up on my health frequently. He then ask about my routine, tells me what to do, guides me, creates an excel sheet of what i should eat. He especially loved to be complimented on and he does also compliment me often.      In person he is very silent and can't look me in the eye but on messages, he is very sweet and wants to take care of me all the time. He tells me if I did well and just exhibits signs of emotional dependency.      If I so much as not talk to him for days, he says he gets worried and asked me if I was okay and he asked me this when he was the one in the hospital as a patient.      The dependency and the emotional support he wants from me tells me there's something there but I fear that we may be in an emotional affair. I know he had a girlfriend last year and I think it's still going on. My question now is how can I remove myself from this? Is it possible for someone to fall inlove even without knowing it?</Content></post><post><Title>HE WANTS A BABY AND I'M CRYING</Title><Author>Unknown author</Author><Content>He was all cuddly and I could tell he had something to say by the excited look on his face.

So I asked him, when did you know?      He said ‚ÄúI knew I truly loved you when one morning, I woke up before you. You looked so cute sleeping and I just laid there watching you for a bit. I knew I was a goner. It was a simple moment, not after sex or anything with heightened emotions, just a simple moment. That‚Äôs when I knew, I truly loved you. I just didn‚Äôt want to say it first because of how hard I pursued you, and how long you took to come around‚Äù      I‚Äôm a very hard person to get to know because I don‚Äôt let others in easily. He stuck through it for months of me saying ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not sure yet‚Äù and I am so glad he did.      We‚Äôve been officially dating a year and 4 months now. It‚Äôs my longest relationship ever and I cannot wait to marry this man one day.      We are literally soul mates.

(This is more of a venting post)      So, i was having a really bad period already, my parents recently divorced and i wasn't already in a mentally good situation.      And after 3 months of relationship, i moticed how my at the time gf was a bit colder than usual, we would hang out rarely and would spend all her time with her "bff"...      Then she broke up with me. Now, im not the guy to get mad cuz "someone lost feelings", she had told me that and, even if i was heartbroken, i accepted t wnd we had talked about it, i wanted to be the best bf ever.      Then, not evem 2 weeks later, she was going around all alone with her bff (she did it probably even 1 week after we broke up), and then even less than 1 month aftwr our break up, i saw her kissing my childhood friend (her bff) in the dark.      I honestly suspect this had been going on for longer, when we were together she used to spend a lot of timw with him, way more than me, and she would say he was her bff.      I remember one day she had spent a whole day with him and afterwards had said she felt like a whore. I had some bad ideas then but i wanted to be positive.      Now i understand everything, and it hurts, i feel replaceable and my mental health and sh are getting worse.      I already tried suicide but im too much of a coward, plus my bff and family would be sad...so i can't do it...      So my omly option is to keep going, but now i don't want to hang out with my group of friends since my ex and her new toy are gonna hang out everyday too.      So i was thinking of maybe just leaving the group for a new one, but how can i? I can't just materialize in a group, i don't have much interests as for now and i don't want to end up in a group of hooligans.      Im good at making superficial friends but i honestly suck at getring close to ppl (the omly person i trust irl is my bff).      What should i do?      (Also i wanted to add, since i don't know this subreddit much, i won't tolerate any incel behavior, sinxe this kind of posts is "content" for them)      And lastly, sorry for the bad english, it's very late at night for me and im not a native speaker.

I won't go into the details because they're irrelevant, but the torment didn't stop all day. There was nothing my boyfriend could do to stop it.      At night, when I was all tucked into bed and ready to sleep, he was next to me. I was feeling so bad after having a bad day that I broke down just as we were about to fall asleep. He sat upright and I thought he was annoyed with me, that made me cry a bit more. He sat cross-legged, took me by my arm (I was facing away from him) and just said "come here" in a soft whisper.      I sat on his lap, wrapped my arms and legs around him and cried. It was a chilly night so he wrapped the blanket around the both of us and slowly rocked back and forth while rubbing my back slowly and giving me light/soft kisses here and there. At one point he whispered "cry your heart out if you want to dear, ive got you". And I did, I cried quite a bit but it was okay, he was there, rocking me back and forth gently in his embrace, reassuring me and giving me soft kisses throughout.      After I was done, I felt so much better. I was smiling and giggling a bit too. He gave me more kisses, quickly ran his fingers through my hair, smiled and tickled me too. It was such a nice feeling after crying so much that my eyes felt sore. He cuddled with me to sleep, making sure I was okay.      I'm so grateful.</Content></post><post><Title>ya ever stared at the ceiling and wished you were normal? had a normal childhood? to stop hurting those you love?</Title><Author>Unknown author</Author><Content>no one helped me move out, staff and faculty at the college are just...im tired of being seen how they see me. im 24f and i just want to be done with my last three semesters follow my new advisor's plan and be free.      my friend is moving, im glad now. he'll love it. i love my new dorm. its refreshing. a new chapter. today i found my old self. she was gone for a long time. she's a lil weird and childish but strong. a believer and a lover, but not for everyone. friends few to none cuz a relationship is what i want. marriage. kids. the ultimate goal. lots of sex. and since i cant have that i'll just focus on finishing by 25.      thats all i have to do. focus on me, enjoy the days and stay on my lane.      i pushed things with my baby ima call him now. i love treating him like a baby. i think of him like that when i touch his ears and hair. i would touch his lips slightly and face if i could. spend all day with his head on my chest or lap giving him affection. being close. i pushed him yesterday but i needed support. i cant let bad energies ruin this. if they didnt already. my nephew healed me. his smell, his cries, his potato face. a small broken piece is fixed. and im happy. im happy cuz im not like my family. we share traits but im out of that cycle. now im dealing with the effects...i've made it this far.      he doesnt know i used to imagine this moment as stories when i was 12-17. that there was a story of two soulmates and one of them was names knight. and his voice is exactly what i would want. i would think of the story in english to make it less personal. he was older than her (YA fictions vampire style lol) had white hair. was kind. i believe in soulmates since i was little. true love. the type that you change for without being told. and i see him trying and i love him for it. i just want him in my arms. in my lips. i want to taste him.      and how we met was me being curious if they had received my resume.  unexpected, i wasnt gonna walk i.  it wss the only place that hired me. he hired me lol. got in trouble for it. and he met me at the end of my tumultuous ass road. i dont think he's old. i love our age gap. inlove he's the dominant one .  i love he's experienced and i dont judge him for it for real. ik i react differently but im curious if his body count is 76. idc, im me. i'll make sure it stays at 77 double lucky.      i love just being there and idc who looks at us. i never did. he's fine like wine. and i cant wait for the right moment to mmmmmmm. it feels that its coming. i saw the mazda of my dream. i just want to tell him i'll wait for him, to make sure to call me and that we'll see each other once a month.  i would do long distance but i need to talk about it. i want to try. i dont want to give up. i stayed. life made  me stay.      i want to taste him so when he leaves i'll just focus on my degree and drawing for fun again cuz i wont waste my time with other people or dating since i'll be his. i want to hear his moans and taste his skin. look into his eyes. open myself to him like  a flower.      rn all i want is to see him next to me.</Content></post><post><Title>When he cuddles me in his sleep. Things he does without realizing it.</Title><Author>Unknown author</Author><Content>So my boyfriend is a wierd sleeper, he talks, sits up, chews in his sleep but he also rolls over and snuggles me in his sleep without realizing it. I'm a light sleeper so I see most of what he does, and myself, I only roll over and cuddle if I wake up.      Last night he rolled over and (I was on my side facing him) placed his head on my hip and was hugging my butt and he slept like that. When I tried to move he squeezed his arms so I wouldn't. He had no recollection of this is the morning. I just love how even asleep he seems out to cuddle me. Last night at one point he rolled over and put an arm around me and plopped his other hand on my head and patted it while out cold. I just feels good to be loved and the physical affection is sublime. Before bed I fell asleep on his chest watching tv and I've never felt so happy.</Content></post><post><Title>Bad communication really ends lot of good things.

I really hope it's not annoying for the other person and their family. How would you even bring it up in a conversation? I (F17) can never invite any friend or romantic interest to my house. To an outsider, the smell of cigarettes hits you as soon as you walk into the house. I know this because we left the house for a few days and came back, and it was the first thing you could smell. Even when my dad smokes outside in the garden, it will still find its way into the house from every possible crack / small gap that exists. We have a very small house and garden. Once it gets through 1 window, it will get into every room of the entire home. It gets into my room the worst out of all the bedrooms, which is incredibly unfair because I'm the one that is the most bothered by it! The smell is stuck to the walls and lingers, it clings onto the curtains (especially after he smokes in the shower and there's steam and smoke mixed together and it's a suffocating combination). He thinks opening a window will do the job... it's exhausting having to worry about my own health, I can't imagine exposing a partner to that too... it makes you feel ashamed even though it's not you.</Content></post><post><Title>everyday i fall more and more in love with my boyfriend</Title><Author>u/Both-Bit-4548</Author><Content>i (21f) have been dating my boyfriend (21m) for just over three years. everyday i am giddy to see him, and i literally cannot wait to see him when he/i come home from work. i still get butterflies when he hugs me and kisses me.      we have lived together for almost 3 years as well, and i thought after a while it get less exciting but it hasn‚Äôt. we had to get a new vacuum yesterday and run a bunch of boring adult errands, and it was still an amazing time because we got to do it together. i have never had as much fun doing laundry until i met him, especially waiting at shitty little laundromats to switch the washer to the dryer.      he makes the little small things so so intimate, i‚Äôll never get bored of doing boring things with him. i‚Äôm so in love with him it makes me sick!</Content></post><post><Title>IM PREGNANT!!!!!!!!</Title><Author>u/This_Significance_78</Author><Content>I‚Äôm so over the moon a fews weeks ago I found I was pregnant üòÜüòÜüòÜüòÜüòÜ and today I found out I‚Äôm having triplets, two boys and a little girl.

She gave me all the information I needed and told me it would take over a month showing me a stack of files, cars waiting to be fixed up too. I was really embarrassed, I needed my car for the next week end and she really seemed sorry but couldn't do anything about it, I thank her for everything and told her not to worry about me, that I'll find a solution. A week after that (today) I came back to ask for news and also to plan a complete checkup of the engine since I'm suspicious of a bigger problem. She remembered me and ask about the situation I was in, if I could find a car to use instead and stuff and then we started to joke about a thing or two, her face really light up and seemed so warm and kind it was a really nice moment she looked so pretty and shy, I wouldn't say I'm in love but she definitely made my day better, I've been single for 3 years, I really can't go over my ex, it was a terrible relationship and i can't trust anyone but today I felt good about talking with a girl, it was so sweet I had to tell this stupid story, it probably seems ridiculous, maybe she was just kind to a client so I would come back next time, in that case it's working, I've been thinking about this moment we had for the whole evening and now writing that story on reddit as I was just going to sleep.

It was a difficult 2 years but we loved each other deeply because we helped each other through some traumatic events. My life has been better since: I can't say I miss him because I feel much lighter. My nervous system is back to normal and I can focus on my next steps (being with him implied not being able to do so, because he's from another country so I literally was waiting for him to move here for 2y, as per his promise. I couldn't make any medium-long term plans for myself). After a month, he now wants me back. I'm pretty confident in my decision not to take him back because feeling so much better is a clear indication of how unwell I was with him. But I just feel super bad about having to reject him, especially because he's really trying. I know what I have to do, it just sucks; why can't people stay away when they know you're better off without them?

And there, over the years, we became really, really good friends. But after about five years, I had to leave my music classes because my parents got divorced, and I was also not in a very good mental condition to continue my music classes because of it. And then we lost touch; all of a sudden, I stopped going there, never told her anything about leaving the music classes‚Äîit was all a surprise. Months went by, and I started realizing that it was not just friendship that we had; it was much more intimate, it was pure love, at least for me. I tried to meet her again, but I never succeeded. And then I remembered that she once told me that her family would be moving to a different state; that's when I lost all hope.      Six years went by, I moved on with my life, but all of a sudden in January, I met her again. That's when we started hanging out again. I realized that she has changed a lot, like a lot! The only things that are still recognizable about her are her face and her voice. I found out that she's suffering from PTSD, Bipolar disorder, and also some physical conditions. But these things never really bothered me, but now it's getting kinda hard for me. Because of her PTSD, I can't even talk to her openly. If I want to joke about something, I think like a hundred times before I even tell her that joke. There are a lot of things that have happened in her life after we lost contact. The more I listen to her stories, the more I want to just hug her and fix everything in her life, but I'm not a superhero, and neither will she allow me to do that. I'd like to know if anyone here has or had a partner like that. I'd love it if you could give me some pointers, and I'd love it even more if you could chat with me about this. I'd also love to talk to someone else who suffers from PTSD. Thank you.</Content></post><post><Title>My girlfriend is a force of nature, and it kinda scares me</Title><Author>u/RightAnybody972</Author><Content>She is everythingg; charming, gorgeous, smart asf, kind like a saint, creative, has silly little hobbies and somehow attracts everyone direct to her, if we wnet to some lonely place in antartica, some grouo of person would appear outta of nowhere like bugs and start a friendshio with her.

I'm very secure about myself but how to live with this feeling that is out of my control?</Content></post><post><Title>My girlfriend said something that made me want to cry because it was exactly what I was about to thank her for</Title><Author>Unknown author</Author><Content>So I (M22) have OCD, I was diagnosed at 14 but it‚Äôs something I‚Äôve struggled with my whole life. One of my symptoms is hand washing (long, long before the pandemic started‚ÄîI‚Äôm talking 10+ years). I wash my hands constantly to the point where they get red, dry, and the skin starts cracking. I use lotion when it gets bad but it usually doesn‚Äôt work, sometimes it provides temporary relief but I‚Äôve pretty much accepted that my hands will always be like this. The effects on my skin are usually worse in the wintertime, but people ask me all the time why my hands are so red and why they‚Äôre so dry and I absolutely hate it. I struggle with this everyday, the compulsions of ‚Äúif I don‚Äôt wash my hands right now, something bad will happen‚Äù and it‚Äôs not really an easy thing to explain to people because a lot of people see OCD as something they can just diagnose themselves because they ‚Äúlike to keep things organized‚Äù I could go on and on about my problem with that statement, as someone who struggles with OCD everyday‚Äîbut that‚Äôs not where I‚Äôm here.      Last night me and my girlfriend (F21) were just chilling at my house and my mom made a comment about how she could tell I had been home because we were running out of soap. She and my sister were talking loudly about it, and my girlfriend and I exchanged looks but neither of us said anything. I think she could tell I was a little bothered so she asked what was wrong, and I told her I was tired of hearing about how much soap I use, and that I couldn‚Äôt control it (washing my hands so much). She immediately said ‚ÄúI know, I know‚Äù and grabbed my arm, listening as I told her I couldn‚Äôt control it and how I don‚Äôt exactly remember when or how it started but it‚Äôd been that way for years, and I was about to thank her for never making me feel bad for it when she looked at me and said just that: ‚ÄúI will never make you feel bad for it babe, and I will always make sure you have all the soap in the world and never run out. Plus, I get a discount on it at my store, so it‚Äôs okay.‚Äù      I wanted to cry hearing those words come out of her mouth before I even had the chance to say anything. This isn‚Äôt the first time she‚Äôs said something that‚Äôs validated my OCD; she‚Äôs made comments here and there before and is completely unbothered by it.      I never thought I‚Äôd find someone who is so accepting of a mental disorder that isn‚Äôt always easy to understand. She‚Äôs never once made me feel bad for it and has always accepted me as I am.      It‚Äôs not an easy battle fighting OCD like this every single day. There‚Äôs also many other factors to it that often feel debilitating and smothering. But to know that she doesn‚Äôt mind, that she can understand something she‚Äôs never had to experience before, that she loves me regardless and chooses not to make me feel bad for something I have no control over‚Äîit made me love her even more. I‚Äôm so thankful to have found this, I‚Äôm so thankful that she‚Äôs never made it a big deal. She even buys big containers of soap so it‚Äôll last us longer.      Anyways, just wanted to tell someone this. It made me feel so validated and loved in that moment‚Äîespecially when she said that right as I was about to thank her for never making me feel bad about it. I‚Äôm a very lucky guy, and it was just one of those things that made me realize that.      Edit: wow thank you guys so much for the love! I promise I will reply to every one of your comments!! Just wanted to leave this here so y‚Äôall know I‚Äôve read every one of them and I appreciate your kind words, and I will respond to all of you when I can!! ‚ù§Ô∏è      Edit: sooooo last night my girlfriend found my post (she uses Reddit as well) and got SO excited and said, ‚Äúoh my god!! This is about me!! Did you see all the comments babe?? People are so sweet üò≠‚Äù so thank you all from both of us for the love and kind words!      I also appreciate those of you that left suggestions for better lotion. I will definitely look into it seeing as winter is around the corner and I‚Äôm not prepared for how bad my hands are going to get. I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôll find something at some point, and thanks to y‚Äôall I have plenty of options to choose from!      I appreciate all the love and kind words. I wasn‚Äôt expecting this much love from this post, but I‚Äôm really glad I got it. Those of you telling me I‚Äôve got a keeper‚ÄîI definitely do. I plan on marrying this girl one day. She‚Äôs everything I‚Äôve ever wanted and more (as cheesy as that sounds)</Content></post><post><Title>I had some random thoughts on love that I decided to pen down</Title><Author>Unknown author</Author><Content>People say they fell in love with someone's personality. But doesn't that mean that you have to be a certain "type" of personality to be loved? Then why do they claim "everyone deserves love",  and that bs? You wouldn't possibly wanna love someone who you know beats people (unless you think you can "fix" them). But then they say don't try to fix people, you'll just end up being hurt yourself. And so we are back to the claim that you have to be a certain type of personality to be loved. But then you can say - someone did try to love that rude person. It's only because of their nature that the other person left. Well, in that case, I would say- did they really "love" them for who they were? The mere idea of "changing" and "fixing them" shows they didn't really accepted them truly for who they really were. Maybe that was the reason why they left.      What if they had accepted the rude person with their rudeness, as well as the good qualities that made them fall in love with them in the first place? Maybe they could have seen that their lover's life is a garden of beautiful trees and some unwanted weeds. Those beautiful trees still might need nurturing, but taking out all those weeds, that's gonna take too long.      As much as it's the responsibility of the rude person to remove those weeds, isn't the lover supposed to help take out those weeds, and see the progress they have been making? Isn't this how people grow in long-lasting love? If the lover decides to give up, isn't that in some way a shortcoming of their own love as well? Wasn't love meant to be sacrifice and shit. Yeah there will be some rude folks who might not be sincere to remove the weeds. In that case, the lover can totally decide to abandon the garden. Cuz if the garden's owner ain't interested in removing weeds, how much the gardener can persevere, the weeds will still grow back again soon.      Anyways, the crux is that the personality of a person can have both positive and negative traits. And though the positive ones might be enough to start a loving relationship, but in order to sustain it, you need to work on weeding out the negatives as well. That's how you would become more and more closer to each other. And the relationship might not feel boring as well cuz you'll be able to see the progress you have been making.</Content></post><post><Title>My girlfriend drunkenly told me that she's been looking at rings</Title><Author>Unknown author</Author><Content>She said the only reason she hasn't asked me to marry her is because she knows I want to wait until we've lived together for a year.

I can‚Äôt really tell too many people about it. I did not set out for this to happen. It just kind of happened. We knew each other for a few years at work but eventually we started actually talking a lot and hanging out (we don‚Äôt work together any more and we both are at different companies) She is gay so I never thought this would be a thing or happen.      When we first started hanging out I had just gotten out of a break up and she was in the middle of a toxic cycle with her ex GF. Kind of a misery loves company thing that bonded us. Every time she would go back to her ex and it would inevitably fail I would be there and pick the pieces up for her and support her emotionally. After about the 4th time in 5 months I started to take it personally and really start to feel an emotional connection to her.      During one of these out times we were hanging out and she crashed at my house (not uncommon). she always just stayed in my other bedroom but this time she stayed with me. We ended up having sex, she basically demanded it. I think she just wanted some physical feeling she was missing and I happened to be there. And my feelings have only gotten worse since then.      Now, circumstances have basically seen her completely separated from her ex. The chance of her coming back into her life are zero at this point. I have been there through it all and I just can‚Äôt stop thinking about her. We had an argument one time about her cycling with her ex and she admitted in that argument that despite being gay she has had thoughts in her head that perhaps she was in love with me. So the thought is at least there for her.      I don‚Äôt want to disrespect her and push her because if she‚Äôs gay shes gay and that‚Äôs my problem to deal with my emotions. But I feel like there is a part of her that is open to the idea. It‚Äôs just killing me. I hate to see her in so much pain. There‚Äôs the friend part of me that wants to support her and be there for her and then there‚Äôs the emotional part that wants to heal her and give her all the love she wants and is missing.      The way she treats me in person is basically strictly in a friend way, especially after we had sex but then I wonder if it‚Äôs just her fighting her own emotions? Like maybe she is so wrapped up in her gay identity she is fighting what she is actually feeling for me? There have been bits here and there that lead me to think that could be true but again, I don‚Äôt want to question her on it because I want to respect her identity.      This is just killing me and I am finding it hard to cope and move throughout my days. I just didn‚Äôt know where to talk about this or who I could talk to. I thought maybe here people could relate or maybe someone would read this story and they are in a similar situation.</Content></post><post><Title>My boyfriend called me out of the blue and said he can‚Äôt imagine being without me</Title><Author>u/puffdoodledaddy</Author><Content>We‚Äôre long distance right now and he called me while I was on a semi break at school. I told him I couldn‚Äôt talk long cause the break was about to be over and he says he just wanted to tell me something he was thinking about earlier real quick. Then he says that even though we haven‚Äôt been together very long, it feels like we‚Äôve been together forever and he can‚Äôt imagine ever not being with me. And he just thought he should tell me that.      He‚Äôs not always the most verbal about his affection for me and it meant so so much to hear that he feels that way. I‚Äôve been feeling like I could be with him forever lately and hearing him hint he was feeling that way too was overwhelmingly wonderful.</Content></post><post><Title>Love is noticing when their smile becomes even a tiny bit larger and especially when it becomes a tiny bit smaller.</Title><Author>u/ntibbs58</Author><Content>That is the entire post.</Content></post><post><Title>What moment made you realize that you were in love with your significant other?</Title><Author>u/Throwawayy93992</Author><Content>I think for me it‚Äôs when he gave me a glimpse into his little musical world. Music is a big deal for him. It‚Äôs one of his favorite hobbies and a very personal type of thing for him. It‚Äôs kinda how he decompresses and hangs out with his buddies. A couple of days ago he brought me into his guitar/instrument room and started singing and playing guitar to one of my FAVORITE grunge bands of all time. Was staring at me too the entire time with the cutest look on his face ever. Keep in mind this man‚Äôs favorite genre is sludge metal so what he did was really probably not his favorite thing to do. But it was so romantic and cute and that‚Äôs when I realized it. Also his voice is insanely beautiful and he just sounded so good.

It‚Äôs currently a long distance relationship so this was the most amount of time we‚Äôve been together since meeting. We were both so emotional after coming back and having to be apart again that I couldn‚Äôt stop crying. Then he cried too. Although it was sad seeing him cry, I felt happy knowing he was comfortable being vulnerable with me. He isn‚Äôt a crier at all so I knew he must have been really upset.      He‚Äôs genuinely my best friend and I‚Äôm glad I have someone who has my back as much as I have theirs. I fall more in love with him each time I see him and he means the world to me.</Content></post><post><Title>My girlfriend sent me this paragraph this morning and it made me cry.</Title><Author>u/ItsMvtt</Author><Content>I love you.

I haven‚Äôt started my career yet and neither has she. I come from a culture where it‚Äôs not right for me to propose, unless I have a house under my name and tbh that seems right to me. I will be starting truck driving in about 4 months, and I will work my ass off so I can save money, get a house, build my credit, save some more money and then propose to her. It just seems right. Also I have to learn Spanish so I can ask her parents for their blessing to marry her. Everything is going to be worth it in the end, and I want to do it right.</Content></post><post><Title>My (F) friend has rejected and humiliated (M) me and now shes trying to get back to me</Title><Author>u/MacaroonForeign9916</Author><Content>First off pardon my english since its not my native language.      I used to be a friend with a girl. We've been friends for seven years and there was no romantic feelings in between us. We did everything together before. She always used to call every single guy narcissist whom she dated. She always have seen herself the most unique woman in the world. She always aimed for rich / bad guys and those she didnt like blocked them all and moved on. To be fair she has never been there for me whenever i needed her support most. She usually used to cancel or forget the plans ive made. At the beginning of this year she gave me mixed signals and ive developed romantic feelings for her and i tried to shake it off but my feelings never gone away. I've decided to confess my love to her and her response was something like this *Shut up before i end our friendship, i break your heart now hahaha* After that rejection she asked me if i could pay for her vacation to join me which was around 1000‚Ç¨ i believe.      She tried to text me a few times, i thought she was sorry but turns out she just kept pretended like nothing happened, ignored my feelings so i ignored her.      She called me twice and tried to make me jealous with a slutty voice for some reason because since we dont speak or travel together anymore. i travel often around with my friends and i dont invite her anymore. As she sees my stories she gets jealous or regrets with her decision i guess?      Three days ago she commented on my story and i completely ignored her message, didnt even bother to open up her message. Later she unsent / remove her message as i didnt open up the chat.      Instead of being sorry and fixing up the friendship, she made everything even worse now.      The reason i didnt block her because i thought blocking her after rejection might be a immature move.      I am not here to play games.</Content></post><post><Title>When someone just‚Ä¶ loves you. It‚Äôs still so weird to me 8 years later</Title><Author>u/guava_jam</Author><Content>Before I(32F) met my husband(33M) 8 years ago, I was made to feel like I was too clingy, too emotional, too sensitive, etc. I was never enough for the men I loved, and I always wanted too much from them. Until I met my husband.      From the start he just‚Ä¶ loved me. I was a mess back then and I tested him a lot, but he always passed with flying colors. When I asked him if he knew he was being tested he said yes, but that he understood because of everything I had been through. We‚Äôd spend hours over the weekends in bed just snuggling until I was overstimulated which was never a thing because no one ever wanted to do that with me. 8 years later it‚Äôs still the same, we can spend all day happily hanging out in bed and just getting up for food and to pee, which is our plan for this Sunday.      Sometimes my insecurities from the past creep up and last night I asked him, ‚ÄúAren‚Äôt I too much sometimes?‚Äù He responded, ‚ÄúNo. What do you mean?‚Äù And I reminded him that even I know I can still be way intense, energetic, and physically and emotionally needy sometimes and he said, ‚ÄúWell that‚Äôs you and I just love you. I don‚Äôt have to think about it harder than that.‚Äù      This morning while he was working I sent him a joke video about getting me baby Highlander cows for Valentine‚Äôs Day. Within 15 minutes he sent me info about a farm an hour away that offers private tours to feed and snuggle baby cows. I never knew this was a thing and we‚Äôve set a date to go.      I love this man so much, and I still find it so weird that he just loves me and I don‚Äôt have to play games or pretend to be anyone else. I do try to hold myself back when I know he needs time alone as we are both pretty introverted, but if ever I feel disconnected from him I just say so and he will open his arms without hesitation so I can jump in. The only time I can‚Äôt do that is when he is in a meeting lol. I don‚Äôt know how I got this lucky.      Edit: thanks for the love everyone üíï</Content></post><post><Title>Couldn‚Äôt figure out why I had such a strong connection with this girl, turns out we were each other‚Äôs first loves back in 1st grade.</Title><Author>u/SOGaeg</Author><Content>I met this girl in middle school, from the start I had feeling towards her, and felt connections and things I just couldn‚Äôt explain or understand, fast forward to high school, we gave it a shot. Turns out she felt the same way about me, and couldn‚Äôt figure it out. Circumstances did us apart eventually, but my feelings are still there and my gut tells me it‚Äôs the same for her. Nearing graduation I had a talk with her about the feelings between us, and agreed that there was something there that neither of us could quite understand. I tend to get waves of early memories out of nowhere sometimes, and one night I got flooded with some very early kindergarten/first grade memories. I remembered one night around Christmas time we had a movie night in 1st grade, and I remembered this girl who had asked me to cuddle during the movie. Everything hit me like a ton of bricks, a bunch more memories of this girl from first grade flooded my head. I asked her what school she had went to for that grade, and then asked her if she remembered that movie night. I could tell it hit her before I even asked. Not sure where things are headed between us now, but hopefully in a good direction. I don‚Äôt think there are many people who can share a love story like that.</Content></post><post><Title>Does one of my girl friends (not gf) like me?</Title><Author>u/Strong-Ad8344</Author><Content>So all the signs ive noticed:one time we and some other friends were at the beach and i was sitting on a rock while the others were playing volley and she just came and sat next to me and she leaned her head on my shoulder for no reason and later one of my other friends was cracking our backs and while we were lying on the sand and after my friend cracked her back she just said that i should sit on her back when we were leaving i caught her staring at me 2 times and idk if she was just zoomed out or no      One other time we and like 10 other ppl were sitting in a circle talking about random stuff and she asked me if she could lay down on my leg (put her head on my leg)      another time we and one other person were chilling and she extended her legs and putted them on mine      does she like me or no(Sorry for bad english its not my main language)</Content></post><post><Title>Love her a little extra on her bad days.</Title><Author>u/suryakantamangaraj</Author><Content>No content</Content></post><post><Title>Best moment of my life getting engaged to the love of my life in South Korea üá∞üá∑</Title><Author>Unknown author</Author><Content>No content</Content></post><post><Title>How to cope with the mental effort of dating in the long run?</Title><Author>u/The_Lockenbubi</Author><Content>23M here. I've gotten rejected a couple of days before like many times in the past already. She was super sweet and supportive to me and truly cared that I'd be fine. Afterwards I told her how much that meant to me, because I've had worse experiences before. Goddamn, she's a great person.      I'll be fine, don't worry.      I've had one worthwile relationship (2,5 years), which was truly lovely and sadly went to crumbles after a while, due to communicative problems from both sides. Apart from that I'm dating / interested in a person around once every one or two years. Not successful, as you might have guessed.      I'd describe myself as slightly above average looking, super compassionate and caring. I'm very extroverted and get to know new people very often. I'm very happy with myself, I'm in a very good mood most of the time, I'm living a pretty good life with my studies, my family and my friends. Of course noone is obligated to like me just because I'm nice, but I feel like I'm a pretty damn good, honourable and loveable person, all flaws and ticks aside and I'd commit myself fully to a relationship if she means the world to me.      However, the process of dating / being interested in a person literally always results in a giant mental effort for me. I tend to overthink a lot, which is why something like mixed signals and complex social situations always kinda ruin my mood for days. I kinda know that this is a problem which I have to live with or fix, however since my compassion and caringness are some of my core values, I kinda don't want to change just because this society has become so spontaneous. No matter what you throw at me, I'll probably never become cold. Reminds me of that quote from Peter Cullen: "Be strong enough to be gentle"      I cannot fathom how spontaneous and sex-centred this society has become and how noone seems to remain interested, if nothing incredible happens for a week.      I know that I'm only 23 years old, however, the last few years have been kinda tough in this regard and I'm starting to question whether I have to change. As stated before, dating tends to demand a giant mental effort of me, which I sometimes don't know how to cope with. I don't know whether this will get better. Also, I hate to admit this, but I feel very lonely often, even though I'm very happy with my life.      Is anyone having similar experiences or has some advice? I'd be truly happy to hear from you.</Content></post><post><Title>Do you ever look at your person and wonder how someone could‚Äôve ever not given them the love they deserve?</Title><Author>Unknown author</Author><Content>My boyfriend is sleeping and I‚Äôve never seen anyone as beautiful as he is.

And i just went for it.      It was nothing more than a lingering peck really. But that's what was perfect about it. It was dark so the nerves were subsided a bit. And it was just us which was even better to me. It was just so innocent and sweet. And that's all I wanted for my first kiss.      And he perfectly punctuated it by saying, I love you.      (Not for the first time we've passed that a while ago)      But it was the perfect moment.      Just laying there on his shoulder, with his arm around me, having kissed him and being so close.      We sat like that the whole way to my house. And his parents aren't the type to point out affection like so many seem to do. So it was casual. But it was everything.      I just love him so damn much and I had to share this moment.  if you want to share your first kiss stories in the comments I'm all for hearing them :)</Content></post><post><Title>Guy has a girlfriend but is emotionally dependent on me</Title><Author>u/ThrowRAventzzz</Author><Content>I'm having a huge dilemma right now with a guy friend. A week ago, it hit me like bricks because he traveled somewhere and broke his bone. I got upset at him and told him why he'd learn how to drive when he knows he's not good at it. Because I was stressed out, i did not talk to him for a week.      He sent me a message. I did not respond then after almost a week, I responded and he said he was worried because I was not responding and if I was okay. I told him i should be asking him that. He said sorry I was stressed out and proceeded to tell me he has a surgery happening, giving me videos of what is going on and where he is at in the hospital.      Even in his state of having a broken bone, he still asked whether my stomach was okay because I was sick in the past.      He also asked me to check up on him tomorrow before and after his surgery. I don't really know what to feel at this point. I feel that he's very emotionally dependent or we are both codependent.      I don't know if the girlfriend is the one who caused the accident but my guy friend is normally cautious so this is really a surprise and out of character for him. He did tell me he was trying to learn how to drive so that he can use it when he goes home to his province.      Why is he emotionally dependent on me when he has a girlfriend? Shouldn't his girlfriend be the one who'll need to check on him before and after surgery?</Content></post><post><Title>Yesterday, my boyfriend told me the moment he knew he loved me and it‚Äôs so wholesome</Title><Author>u/chabbiedabbie</Author><Content>I said I love you first but my boyfriend said he felt it for a while before I said it.      So I asked him, when did you know?      He said ‚ÄúI knew I truly loved you when one morning, I woke up before you. You looked so cute sleeping and I just laid there watching you for a bit. I knew I was a goner. It was a simple moment, not after sex or anything with heightened emotions, just a simple moment. That‚Äôs when I knew, I truly loved you. I just didn‚Äôt want to say it first because of how hard I pursued you, and how long you took to come around‚Äù      I‚Äôm a very hard person to get to know because I don‚Äôt let others in easily. He stuck through it for months of me saying ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not sure yet‚Äù and I am so glad he did.      We‚Äôve been officially dating a year and 4 months now. It‚Äôs my longest relationship ever and I cannot wait to marry this man one day.      We are literally soul mates. We have had 1 fight that got resolved later that day, and it was more of an emotional discussion than a fight.      We are literally always happy together and I am a better person when I‚Äôm around him. He says the same about me.      I found my forever person.

His is words of affirmation and mine has more to do with acts of service. I told him that spontaneity is something I appreciate and that if there is anything that he could bring himself to do that I least expect for him to, I would appreciate it a lot.      How he responded to it was that he told me how he would happily find ways for us to have not only quality time but fun together. It made me feel so reassured knowint that he isn't one to make me feel bad for the needs I could have in our relationship, but rather, try to make it even better for me.</Content></post><post><Title>Have you ever made your partner cry before? I have.</Title><Author>u/Scrapiee</Author><Content>Yesterday we went to the beach together which has a big theme park right by the pier. We spent the majority of the day walking around the park, going on the rides, talking and singing. We‚Äôre always singing. He always has a song stuck in his head and I always sing along. He was singing ‚Äòfall into me‚Äô by Forest Blakk, and I asked him if he knew ‚ÄòI get to love you‚Äô by Ruelle. He did and we sung it a little as we were sat down having a cold drink. We discussed using it as our wedding song one day, (we decided it would be the first dance) and then we carried on with our day.      We had a two hour drive home which we spent mostly singing. We played yellow mini (yep, we‚Äôre British) and we stopped off for pizza. After we ate we were about 30 minutes away from home, we continued singing in the car but we had turned the music down and we both started to feel a bit more relaxed.      Ruelle started playing and one of the first lyrics in that song is ‚ÄúI prayed for you.‚Äù My boyfriend looked at me and said ‚Äúliterally.‚Äù I asked him what he meant as he isn‚Äôt religious. He said that when we started talking, he genuinely got on his knees and said a prayer out loud for us. This melted my heart on its own, but I remembered that we already declared this song as our wedding song earlier on in the day and I was imagining it. I imagined how I‚Äôd remember this moment in years to come as we‚Äôre dancing together for the first time as a married couple.      When he noticed I was crying, he also started crying, and we both carried on until we got home. We both agreed that we‚Äôve never felt such an overwhelming feeling for someone else ever before. I constantly feel like I‚Äôm living in a Fairytale with this man. I never thought I‚Äôd ever be so lucky.</Content></post><post><Title>If this gets 10 upvotes I'll tell my crush that I love her.</Title><Author>Unknown author</Author><Content>:) Edit: I told her guys I was surprised by her answer but she said yes :)      Another edit: I realized the "yes" is a weird way to word it sorry I was excited when she said she liked me back and just wanted to make an edit on it :)</Content></post><post><Title>Does anyone else read this sub and think ‚Äúdamn I wish that was written about me‚Äù?</Title><Author>Unknown author</Author><Content>My bf is not much of a romantic (he shows his love in his own way) so he would never write one of these posts about me but damn y‚Äôall have lucky partners.</Content></post><post><Title>My wife is out of town til Tuesday night &amp;amp; I want to surprise her.

I won't go into the details because they're irrelevant, but the torment didn't stop all day. There was nothing my boyfriend could do to stop it.      At night, when I was all tucked into bed and ready to sleep, he was next to me. I was feeling so bad after having a bad day that I broke down just as we were about to fall asleep. He sat upright and I thought he was annoyed with me, that made me cry a bit more. He sat cross-legged, took me by my arm (I was facing away from him) and just said "come here" in a soft whisper.      I sat on his lap, wrapped my arms and legs around him and cried. It was a chilly night so he wrapped the blanket around the both of us and slowly rocked back and forth while rubbing my back slowly and giving me light/soft kisses here and there. At one point he whispered "cry your heart out if you want to dear, ive got you". And I did, I cried quite a bit but it was okay, he was there, rocking me back and forth gently in his embrace, reassuring me and giving me soft kisses throughout.      After I was done, I felt so much better. I was smiling and giggling a bit too. He gave me more kisses, quickly ran his fingers through my hair, smiled and tickled me too. It was such a nice feeling after crying so much that my eyes felt sore. He cuddled with me to sleep, making sure I was okay.      I'm so grateful.</Content></post><post><Title>A guy doesnt protect a girl because she is weak.

I just need to rant please‚Ä¶</Title><Author>u/winniespooh</Author><Content>I‚Äôm about to end things with a man that I immediately felt a strong connection to. We met on a dating app and texted each other for hours for the first few nights. Then we went on two dates that week and it felt like a magical connection. The next week he fell into a depression hole and has been trying to get better for the last couple of months but he‚Äôs so deep in the hole that it completely changed our relationship potential. He‚Äôs failed to show up for me multiple times now.      But the connection between us is so strong. I‚Äôve never met a man who I can slow dance with and sing to so intimately. I‚Äôve never met a man who I wanted to make love to (not just fuck) and DID make beautiful love to every time we were together. Our interactions have felt so easy and we laugh so much together. We are both ready for love and for finding a partner. But his mental health can‚Äôt be fixed right now and he can‚Äôt show up for me as the partner that I need. We both agreed it‚Äôs probably time for this to end.      It‚Äôs just so depressing to me that I finally found the type of connection I want but he mentally can‚Äôt be there for me. It feels like a big prank from the universe to tease this connection I crave but make it impossible for a relationship to work.

I‚Äôm so in love with this guy that sometimes it doesn‚Äôt seem real. I‚Äôve known his family since I was 16. His parents have always been so welcoming and kind to me since the first time his sister had me over to hang out after school.      My friend has been so supportive of us and is thrilled that we‚Äôre together but I‚Äôve never really gotten his parent‚Äôs thoughts on us being together. I‚Äôve been to their house a few times since I‚Äôve been dating him and they both still seemed just as nice as ever. Last night we attended his cousin‚Äôs wedding. It was the first big family function of theirs I attended as his girlfriend.      When we first got to the reception hall their dad made a big deal out of us walking in holding hands. He‚Äôs one of those dads who‚Äôs always making corny jokes and is just the sweetest guy. He came up to us and jokingly asked me ‚ÄúYou know you can do better than this guy, don‚Äôt you?‚Äù I told him I didn‚Äôt think I could.      Later in the evening when my boyfriend went to get us drinks I was sitting with his parents. His mom said ‚ÄúSo. You and Robbie, huh?‚Äù She always calls him Robbie and he hates it. I said ‚ÄúYeah, I think he‚Äôs just the greatest.‚Äù Or something like that. She told me she thinks it‚Äôs adorable that we got together and that we make the cutest couple. His dad chimes in that we‚Äôre half a cute couple. Then he gets all serious and says that they both think I‚Äôm a wonderful young woman and there‚Äôs no one else they‚Äôd rather see their son dating!      I actually felt like crying. I think the world of their family and it feels so good to hear them say something like this to me. Then his mom squeezed my hand and said ‚ÄúRobbie really couldn‚Äôt have done any better for himself.‚Äù Ok. Now I really thought I might cry.I thanked them both for always being so kind to me over the years and welcoming me into their family. I really do feel like I‚Äôm a part of their family now.</Content></post><post><Title>My boyfriend and I bought matching snoopy mugs.

He makes me feel peaceful in a way I‚Äôve never felt peace before. He supports me for being me and gives me the space I need when I need it, while still being understanding and caring and there for me.

I‚Äôve never been the type of person to believe in one soulmate or even wanting kids for that matter, but he‚Äôs truly my best friend and I want to grow up to experience something as life changing as raising kids together and being there to support one another and make light of situations through the ups and downs.

Five minutes later I hear his breathing get a little slower, and he starts lightly snoring and I‚Äôm like hell yes! My baby fell asleep!

I value different perspectives, so here's my story: I recently returned from a trip to Norway, where I visited a very good friend (female) of mine. I'm 30, and she's turning 29 soon. She's been living in Norway since 2008 (originally from Germany) and have met inside an online Chatroom in 2009.      Although we've known each other for 15 years, we never met until now. During my 5-day visit, I spent time with her, her bestie, and some other friends and family. They all seemed to like me, including her. Despite her shyness, we grew closer in the last 24 hours of my trip. We kissed, cuddled, and had a great time together, but nothing sexual happened, even though we slept on her best friend's couch.      Just yesterday, while being out for some drinks with her friends she told me that she enjoys my company a lot. We do spoke about us and whatsoever, since we liked each other very much. But in terms of a possible long-distance relationship, she answered with a "no-way". However, I'm seriously considering moving to Norway because I felt so comfortable there, reminiscent of my experience in Australia in 2017 (not only for being loved drunk or anything).      I've always had feelings for her, and she admitted the same. Being close to her felt natural and right. Saying goodbye at the airport was tough for me, and I felt emotional throughout the flight, which rarely happens to me.      I'm not looking to pressure her, as she's sensitive about that. When is the right time to discuss our situation again?      I don't want to miss an opportunity, but I also don't want to rush her. She seemed pleasantly surprised when I mentioned moving to Norway for her, but it's hard to gauge her true feelings.      Any advice?</Content></post><post><Title>Marry you a man that cares this much.</Title><Author>u/Nerobus</Author><Content>Currently, my husband is outside in the pouring rain to make sure the stray cats that live around our house have a dry place to sleep tonight.

After class I didn‚Äôt want to wake him, so I did other homework and waited. Hours passed and eventually I just decided to snuggle up with him. I thought I‚Äôd get on my phone or something to pass the time.      He wrapped his arm around me, still totally asleep, and snuggled me. I felt so warm and safe and contented. I fell asleep within minutes. I know this doesn‚Äôt sound like anything significant, but I have a lot of trouble napping because I‚Äôm usually too consumed by anxious feelings about work I need to get done.      The fact that I was able to fall asleep so quickly in the middle of the day with him makes me so happy. Hearing his slow breathing and being all wrapped up is so comforting. There‚Äôs really nothing like it. I feel so lucky.      These impromptu naps have happened only a few times, and I look back on every one of them so fondly. It‚Äôs such a rare moment of letting go &amp;amp; relaxing for me and I love that I can have those moments with someone I love so much.      So, yeah. Love is naps.      This is my first post here and personal post on Reddit in general!! My partner is also the one who introduced me to Reddit.

One of my symptoms is hand washing (long, long before the pandemic started‚ÄîI‚Äôm talking 10+ years). I wash my hands constantly to the point where they get red, dry, and the skin starts cracking. I use lotion when it gets bad but it usually doesn‚Äôt work, sometimes it provides temporary relief but I‚Äôve pretty much accepted that my hands will always be like this. The effects on my skin are usually worse in the wintertime, but people ask me all the time why my hands are so red and why they‚Äôre so dry and I absolutely hate it. I struggle with this everyday, the compulsions of ‚Äúif I don‚Äôt wash my hands right now, something bad will happen‚Äù and it‚Äôs not really an easy thing to explain to people because a lot of people see OCD as something they can just diagnose themselves because they ‚Äúlike to keep things organized‚Äù I could go on and on about my problem with that statement, as someone who struggles with OCD everyday‚Äîbut that‚Äôs not where I‚Äôm here.      Last night me and my girlfriend (F21) were just chilling at my house and my mom made a comment about how she could tell I had been home because we were running out of soap. She and my sister were talking loudly about it, and my girlfriend and I exchanged looks but neither of us said anything. I think she could tell I was a little bothered so she asked what was wrong, and I told her I was tired of hearing about how much soap I use, and that I couldn‚Äôt control it (washing my hands so much). She immediately said ‚ÄúI know, I know‚Äù and grabbed my arm, listening as I told her I couldn‚Äôt control it and how I don‚Äôt exactly remember when or how it started but it‚Äôd been that way for years, and I was about to thank her for never making me feel bad for it when she looked at me and said just that: ‚ÄúI will never make you feel bad for it babe, and I will always make sure you have all the soap in the world and never run out. Plus, I get a discount on it at my store, so it‚Äôs okay.‚Äù      I wanted to cry hearing those words come out of her mouth before I even had the chance to say anything. This isn‚Äôt the first time she‚Äôs said something that‚Äôs validated my OCD; she‚Äôs made comments here and there before and is completely unbothered by it.      I never thought I‚Äôd find someone who is so accepting of a mental disorder that isn‚Äôt always easy to understand. She‚Äôs never once made me feel bad for it and has always accepted me as I am.      It‚Äôs not an easy battle fighting OCD like this every single day. There‚Äôs also many other factors to it that often feel debilitating and smothering. But to know that she doesn‚Äôt mind, that she can understand something she‚Äôs never had to experience before, that she loves me regardless and chooses not to make me feel bad for something I have no control over‚Äîit made me love her even more. I‚Äôm so thankful to have found this, I‚Äôm so thankful that she‚Äôs never made it a big deal. She even buys big containers of soap so it‚Äôll last us longer.      Anyways, just wanted to tell someone this. It made me feel so validated and loved in that moment‚Äîespecially when she said that right as I was about to thank her for never making me feel bad about it. I‚Äôm a very lucky guy, and it was just one of those things that made me realize that.      Edit: wow thank you guys so much for the love! I promise I will reply to every one of your comments!! Just wanted to leave this here so y‚Äôall know I‚Äôve read every one of them and I appreciate your kind words, and I will respond to all of you when I can!! ‚ù§Ô∏è      Edit: sooooo last night my girlfriend found my post (she uses Reddit as well) and got SO excited and said, ‚Äúoh my god!! This is about me!! Did you see all the comments babe?? People are so sweet üò≠‚Äù so thank you all from both of us for the love and kind words!      I also appreciate those of you that left suggestions for better lotion. I will definitely look into it seeing as winter is around the corner and I‚Äôm not prepared for how bad my hands are going to get. I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôll find something at some point, and thanks to y‚Äôall I have plenty of options to choose from!      I appreciate all the love and kind words. I wasn‚Äôt expecting this much love from this post, but I‚Äôm really glad I got it. Those of you telling me I‚Äôve got a keeper‚ÄîI definitely do. I plan on marrying this girl one day.

It‚Äôs the same with family and friends. They may criticize you because they want you to be happy. But filtered through lack, the message of love is lost. Trying to use negativity to inspire positivity doesn‚Äôt work as a long-term solution.  Self-love = Focusing on anything that helps you feel a little better.    So you don't have to focus on what you like about yourself if that feels challenging. Instead, if you focus on what you liked about a sunny day or cute animals (i.e. subjects that are easier for you to focus on what you like), then that will naturally carry over into helping you like yourself more.      Also note the Self-Love Paradox: To truly love yourself, you are okay with those times when you don‚Äôt. You have self-compassion for when you don‚Äôt take care of yourself.      .  How to Love Yourself1. Connect with Your Body.‚ÄúWhat do you need today, body? You support me a lot, so how may I serve and support you?‚Äù (E.g. Drink plenty of water, deep breathing, grounding work and felt sense, better quality sleep, healthier diet, hug yourself, put your hand on your heart, pay more attention to your five senses, and move your body ‚Äî dancing, exercise, stretching, etc.).  2. Connect with Nature.Your body came from Earth, so you‚Äôre literally connecting with your roots. (E.g. Go for a walk, hiking, the beach, walk barefoot in dirt, buy and take care of or interact with plants, listen to nature sounds, and/or go outside and get at least 10 - 15 minutes of sunlight each day.).  3. Connect with Your Negative Emotions.Negative emotions are positive guidance (although it might not feel that way) letting you know you are focusing on (and pushing against or judging) what you don't want. Negative emotions are just messengers of limiting beliefs you're practicing. They're a necessary part of your emotional guidance, like GPS in your car. But the more you fight them, you keep yourself stuck.  All emotions are equal and worthy. But most people unknowingly create a hierarchy for their emotions (i.e. positive = good; negative = bad), but then you make it harder to feel better. Begin seeing negative emotions as worthy, valuable and supportive friends, and work together as a team to help you feel better.  4. Connect with Your Creativity.You have unique energy that needs to be expressed. Find creative outlets to express yourself (e.g. dancing, singing, writing, drawing, painting, etc.). Experiment with different creative outlets until you find ones you resonate with.  5. Connect with Your Spiritual Side.Meditate for 2 - 15 minutes every day (either listening to guided meditations, nature sounds, or in peace and quiet).      ~ BFree      .  Share your thoughts: What tips are you going to start doing to improve your self-worth and love yourself?      .</Content></post><post><Title>things my boyfriend does that‚Äôs sexy, but is not sexual</Title><Author>u/nuts_in_yo_mouf</Author><Content>(copying this idea from a post i saw in this subreddit)      for a lil backstory me (f19) and my bf (m19) attend the same college together where i met him :)      buys me flowers      brings me coffee in the morning      stands behind me whenever i‚Äôm doing any squat workouts/bending over motions at the gym      rolls me my own blunt whenever i ask      doesn‚Äôt try to hide anything, is open with his emotions, phone, etc. as he willingly tells me his passwords to anything as well as reassuring me even if i did not ask      drives me around with his hand on my thigh      is clingy, but not in the bad or controlling way      waits to watch certain shows/movies so we can see it together      good style. like he‚Äôs got that shit on always      lifts me up into his raised bed so i don‚Äôt have to climb up it      winks at me when he‚Äôs playing basketball at the gym and im working out nearby      shows confidence, NOT cockiness      makes eye contact with guys who stare at me (usually the gym)      his eyes get realllllyyy low when he‚Äôs high      buys me food and refuses to let me pay      hugs me so that my head is right under his chin      shows me off and brags to his friends and family constantly      takes pics of me when i‚Äôm not looking and i end up always catching him staring at the pics later on his phone      gets along so incredibly well with my friends      talks a lot, (he has adhd) he also has a very deep voice and i could listen to him talk forever      made me a playlist that we can both add to      made a movie list that we can both add to      holds my hand everywhere      rubs/scratches my back when i‚Äôve had a long day      incredibly polite to everyone, whether it be a server or stranger asking for directions      can form the most creative jokes known to man idk how he does this one      edit: for those saying ‚Äúbare minimum‚Äù maybe take a look around you and notice that a majority of men, especially around my age, wouldn‚Äôt do this. bare minimum or not, i deserve it and it‚Äôs nice to receive for the first time ever in a boyfriend!! keep it positive for your own sake</Content></post><post><Title>I got attacked by wasps in animal crossing and my love came down stairs to check on me.</Title><Author>u/BobbySlobbins</Author><Content>I've just got the game for Christmas and was not expecting the wasps so cried out 'nooo!

It might sound weird, but all of us are going through troubling times. One friends mom has cancer, the other friend has some soul searching to do, and we've been friends for half our lives. My personal journey is purely finding myself and coming to an understanding of who I am and the inherent fact that being is okay because there's nothing else to do. Anyway.      Scent has taught me a bit what love is. How love is. Platonically. Romantically. The works. And the platonic love for my friends really is making me see things in a new light with scent. When the one friend opens up and is usually sitting next to me, I can smell his vulnerability if that makes sense. It's usually a smell that eminates when he can finally release all his frustrations, and it calms me in a way that lets me be empathical to his plight. And this really has helped create a back and forth that strengthened our friendship more than ever.      The same goes for the other friend as well. And in general, while they always had specific "scents", it's funny how I'm now able to sorta pick up on their moods now and it helping me be the best possible version of myself for each situation based on it. Like there's tiny fluctuations and variations to the base scent that I can pick up on that sorta tells me the ups and downs of how they're feeling.      I just wanna say how much I love and cherish my friends, cause they've always helped me without realizing it, without feeling it, and now I can give back in tenfoldw for all the years they've put up with me. My senses are finally working and tuning themselves, and I now know what love is.

You never chose to be this way. You didn't choose to be an over thinker.      You wish you didn't have to re-read or take a second to think about what they said. Their words never seem to come out as hurtful but to you, the over thinker; they are and they always will be.      You try your best not to over analyze the things they say but it never works. You take what is said and make the worst of it. When something of minor inconvenience takes hold, it isn't just minor anymore. It engulfs your entire mind to the point where you are overthinking everything.  EveryLastThing.      You start to question everything about the relationship. You let your emotions take over and conquer you.      You‚Äôre worried, aren't you?      You‚Äôre worried that one day your overthinking will be too much and they will leave just like everyone else, right?      You don‚Äôt mean to be clingy. You don't want to become a burden that you think you‚Äôre becoming to them.      So what do you do?      You overthink.      You doubt their love for you is as strong as yours. How could they love you the same? As an over thinker you question everything. You‚Äôre worried about them wanting to be with someone else like when they take too long to respond. ‚ÄúThey must have found someone else‚Äù. As a result; you respond right away because you've been waiting for their response for hours..      You assume that they were talking to someone better. Your mind takes you into a state of emergency of overthinking. Telling you only the wrong things you don't need to hear.    When they‚Äôre too busy to see you, it auto corrects in your mind as ‚Äúthey do not want to see me‚Äù.      Any simple texts can turn into a roller coaster full of over thinking emotions.      Now from everything i've addressed.. Forget about it and take a minute to process what i‚Äôm about to say.      Don‚Äôt go back and re-read what they said.. You have nothing to worry about. Do not doubt their love for you, that hurts their feelings. They just have different ways of showing love than you do.You are not a burden to them, they just have a busy life on top of your relationship. They do love you as much as you do. They haven't responded in a while? Be patient, they want to talk to you they are just busy. When they are too busy to see you, don't take it personally; understand that they will make time when they can. They are trying. So try to understand from their point of view as well. So please do not overthink about your relationship, it isn't healthy for you or your partner.      How do I know this?      Because I have felt the same things.. I have been anxious about not getting a text back in a certain amount of time. I have thought they didn‚Äôt love me anymore because of little things they say. But with that being said, I'm learning (have learned) to not let it control me as much as it used to‚Ä¶  Just remember    Everything will be okay, just breathe.

I haven‚Äôt started my career yet and neither has she. I come from a culture where it‚Äôs not right for me to propose, unless I have a house under my name and tbh that seems right to me. I will be starting truck driving in about 4 months, and I will work my ass off so I can save money, get a house, build my credit, save some more money and then propose to her. It just seems right. Also I have to learn Spanish so I can ask her parents for their blessing to marry her.

Where do I start? If I really want to find love, where would be a good place to get started but I feel tinder and all those dating sites could be a scam.      What should I find in someone that could light a spark in a relationship. I am an anime geek so perhaps someone else who is an anime geek, like owning pokemon/Yu-Gi-Oh cards, gundams, etc.      Do I need to make more money to sustain a relationship. I don't make the most money admittedly but I know being financially stable is a plus.      And what should I do in the case I do find someone? I always hear "be yourself" but a part of me feels it Is quite cliche.      I might have others but I think this is a start.

Turns out she felt the same way about me, and couldn‚Äôt figure it out. Circumstances did us apart eventually, but my feelings are still there and my gut tells me it‚Äôs the same for her. Nearing graduation I had a talk with her about the feelings between us, and agreed that there was something there that neither of us could quite understand. I tend to get waves of early memories out of nowhere sometimes, and one night I got flooded with some very early kindergarten/first grade memories. I remembered one night around Christmas time we had a movie night in 1st grade, and I remembered this girl who had asked me to cuddle during the movie. Everything hit me like a ton of bricks, a bunch more memories of this girl from first grade flooded my head. I asked her what school she had went to for that grade, and then asked her if she remembered that movie night. I could tell it hit her before I even asked. Not sure where things are headed between us now, but hopefully in a good direction. I don‚Äôt think there are many people who can share a love story like that.</Content></post><post><Title>You ever just crush hard on your SO even though you've been together for a minute?</Title><Author>u/flatbootybih</Author><Content>I'm missing my boyfriend tonight so I'm scrolling through his social media just to see his face and seriously some of his pictures make my heart skip a beat.

What do I do?</Title><Author>u/mrconjust</Author><Content>My(26m) gf (25f) broke up with me the second time in a week today over a past argument      She was already getting in her head a lot thinking I don‚Äôt care and don‚Äôt want to talk to her but I said that couldn‚Äôt be further from the truth. I always made time, always responded promptly to her calls and texts and never made her feel unheard or disrespected      I suggested we keep our phone calls to before 8pm because I want to start bettering my life and making more money so we could move out of our parents places and have a future. She was hurt by that because she felt I didn‚Äôt care, and left my stuff by my door. I gave her the weekend to cool off and we were able to reconcile on Monday the 6th      I was elated to finally have it behind us. We spent the night getting intimate and watching our shows together, doing our typical activities. Spent the 7th shopping and went to the gym and she left for work on the 8th      Last night we had a fun phone conversation as usual, nothing out of the ordinary. We said our I love yous and went to bed. This morning she asked if she could come by and get her picnic basket because she had a new girl co worker and they wanted to picnic before work. She stopped by just this morning around 11am      She was happy to see me. We talk about next Friday as a date night and she seemed excited. We talk about doing the gym as usual tonight. Just as we were putting everything in her car she said ‚ÄúHow do you feel about the way you‚Äôve treated me in this relationship?‚Äù      I was a little taken aback but I said ‚ÄúI feel I‚Äôve done my best in making sure I reciprocate the love you give me. There‚Äôs always room for improvement, especially for me, but I hope I‚Äôve made you feel happy.‚Äù      She said ‚ÄúYou have but‚Ä¶idk. I think someone who loves me wouldn‚Äôt have made me feel unworthy of a phone call. And I‚Ä¶ I think I‚Äôm done.‚Äù      I saw this as she needed me to reassure her more so I said ‚ÄúI know how that made you feel and I hate that I said it. But I just want to reaffirm that I always want to hear from you baby, I think about you all the time.‚Äù      She kept saying something similar and about how she needed to go. We made out, held each other close and kissed very passionately. She drove off with tears in her eyes and blew me a kiss. I‚Äôm still in shock that this all happened just a couple hours ago. The love of my life walked out on me just like that, and so sudden too. Deleted our pictures on Instagram too. What do you guys think? That maybe there is someone else? Should I try and reach out to her or give her time?      TL;DR: Gf gets in her head that I don‚Äôt want to talk but that couldn‚Äôt be further from the truth and now she‚Äôs broken up.

Please Appreciate Your Spouse. Both Married And Non Married.</Title><Author>u/instantwins24</Author><Content>Appreciate your spouse while they‚Äôre alive. Nobody‚Äôs perfect, I know that.      I know couples argue and have disagreements on things. That‚Äôs part of every relationship, both married and non married, is it not?      Appreciate having your husband or wife, boyfriend or girlfriend with you while they‚Äôre alive. The little things and the big things. They both matter.      For example, like helping around the home, or taking care of the kid(s). If you have any, that is.      Marriage and relationships aren‚Äôt always perfect. That‚Äôs the beauty of it. It‚Äôs imperfect. Because we, as people, are imperfect. We make mistakes, we hurt each other.      But we also forgive and love each other. Nobody‚Äôs immortal. For some of us, you‚Äôll never know how good you had it until it‚Äôs too late. Taken for granted.      Appreciate your spouse. The way they talk, their smile, their voice, their actions, the intimacy between you both. The little things and the big things.      Never go to bed angry. Instead, work it out the next day with sleep and a clear mind.      As someone with parents who don‚Äôt and didn‚Äôt have the best marriage or relationship, I IMPLORE you to find time to appreciate your spouse.      You don‚Äôt have to say it out loud or to them. But, maybe, to remind yourself of why you fell in love with and married them.      And take some time to be kinder to eachother.      It doesn't matter how mad you are at eachother, there's always room to show kindness.      Our time on this world is limited. Please don‚Äôt take it for granted. Use it wisely.</Content></post><post><Title>I finally kissed him</Title><Author>u/id0ntevenkn0wdude</Author><Content>It was kinda perfect to be honest      Nothing like, "we were dancing to our song and then blah blah" not that that's bad just..yea anyways      I went to watch him in his marching band performance And then we went out to dinner with his parents      While they were outside smoking before we left the restuarant, we were in the car and I was laying on his shoulder      And I looked up at him and he was just looking at me with that cute smile      He looked like he was going to kiss me But was unsure So he just kinda looked at me      I said hello and smiled to fill the silence      And when I went to kiss him on the cheek, too nervous to go for a real kiss, he seemed to assume I was trying to kiss him, so he looked at me. And i just went for it.      It was nothing more than a lingering peck really. But that's what was perfect about it. It was dark so the nerves were subsided a bit. And it was just us which was even better to me. It was just so innocent and sweet. And that's all I wanted for my first kiss.      And he perfectly punctuated it by saying, I love you.      (Not for the first time we've passed that a while ago)      But it was the perfect moment.      Just laying there on his shoulder, with his arm around me, having kissed him and being so close.      We sat like that the whole way to my house. And his parents aren't the type to point out affection like so many seem to do. So it was casual. But it was everything.      I just love him so damn much and I had to share this moment.  if you want to share your first kiss stories in the comments I'm all for hearing them :)</Content></post><post><Title>I'm probably too young to say, but I hope I can stay with her forever, I haven't committed to much, but maybe I can commit to her</Title><Author>u/Ok-Outside1031</Author><Content>Yesterday me and her shared 2 bags of different types of hot chips we got from class behavior points. I wrote her 2 notes, I gave her a cute card with cats on it, I showed her a little fold up joke thing I made from a weirdly shaped piece of paper.      I made her laugh so many times yesterday, she was beautiful before, during and after each one. She was drawing, normally she likes quiet when doing that but she wanted me to yap more, even when I had nothing to actually say. I love her, so much. She loves me too.      She asked me, when sitting on the floor with me while I was sick in the middle of our third period english class, she asked me that if I wouldn't leave the world with her, that if I wouldn't let her kill herself alone either, could we just stick together no matter what. Of course I said yes, I was already planning on it.      I love her so much. So fucking much. I didn't even know her for half the school year, we only learned eachothers names on february 1st, its may 11 and I think we'd die for eachother. She's my best friend. Sometimes I love her so hard I wonder if it's still platonic, but it is, it's just my first time truly having a best friend.      I'd hold her hand right now to make sure her heart were still beating, her body still warm and her still alive.

And, I don't mean soulmates in the strictest sense of the word but just the kind of love for another person that transcends any other material desires. I used to think I had that kind of bond with somebody, where our souls were invariably connected to each others. He felt strongly about me in that sense too, but our story was always incomplete because we met online and never really met. I told him i couldn't be with me because of the distance and eventually got into a relationship with somebody else.      I couldn't survive that relationship though and it ended because I could never get really get over him and would keep needing him in my life. There was a point where all of this got too much for me and I took a break from everything (about 2 months).BTW the timeline is a bit weird, at this point we have liked each other for about 2 years.      But when I came back, he had "moved on" gotten into a relationship with somebody else and showed no affection for me whatsoever in the way he spoke to me. I was also going through a really difficult time when I reached out to him again due to my mothers sickness but he completely shut me off and ignored me for this new girl he had met.      Though, I pushed him away many times, there was always a certain care and consideration in my words. If not that, at least a kind of hope for a future together even if we couldn't be in each others lives now.      when i found out he started dating someone else I felt betrayed more than anything else. We never verbally made the decision to wait for each other - but the things he said to me made me feel like he could never possibly love anyone else like this - how could it be possible? It's true we never met, but is it really that easy to move on from that feeling, the feeling of two souls being deeply connected?      Sometimes, i cannot believe I trusted his words and kept my eyes filled with the dreams of a future together. The way he acts with me now, it feels as if there was nothing between us. We have no contact whatsoever. In fact, he didn't even check up on me after I told him of my mothers sickness, which hurt me more because he didn't even try to be my friend. To be clear, I don't hate him for moving on. I still care for him and i understand it must have been lonely. After all, i dated people too after we had been together. I don't blame him, truly I don't, but somewhere there is this disbelief over his loss.      I used to believe in the idea of soulmates because of him. That no matter how many years pass by or how much the distance is, nobody else could ever touch us the way we had touched each other. I just wanna know from everyone else's experience, that is it stupid of me to chase after that feeling again?      I am not doubtful of the fact that I can find a comfortable companionship with somebody someday. I just wanna know if the kind of soul-mate connection I always dreamed of, and even felt to some extent, is possible to have with someone.      I am certain, now, that he is not the one for me because of the ease with which he has discarded me from his life. But is it stupid of me to expect a true 'soulmate' from the universe one day?      TL;DR: I used to believe in soulmates because of a deep connection with someone I met online, but things ended when I couldn't commit due to distance. He moved on quickly, making me doubt if such connections exist. Now I wonder if I'll find the same, if not better, connection again or if it's silly to hope for one.</Content></post><post><Title>My boyfriend can‚Äôt sing at all &amp;lt;3</Title><Author>u/telepathicavocado</Author><Content>I‚Äôm on the toilet, he‚Äôs got Mr. Brightside playing from the kitchen, he‚Äôs tone deaf, he‚Äôs singing, I can hear him, I‚Äôm in love.

I‚Äôm so in love with this guy that sometimes it doesn‚Äôt seem real. I‚Äôve known his family since I was 16. His parents have always been so welcoming and kind to me since the first time his sister had me over to hang out after school.      My friend has been so supportive of us and is thrilled that we‚Äôre together but I‚Äôve never really gotten his parent‚Äôs thoughts on us being together. I‚Äôve been to their house a few times since I‚Äôve been dating him and they both still seemed just as nice as ever. Last night we attended his cousin‚Äôs wedding. It was the first big family function of theirs I attended as his girlfriend.      When we first got to the reception hall their dad made a big deal out of us walking in holding hands. He‚Äôs one of those dads who‚Äôs always making corny jokes and is just the sweetest guy. He came up to us and jokingly asked me ‚ÄúYou know you can do better than this guy, don‚Äôt you?‚Äù I told him I didn‚Äôt think I could.      Later in the evening when my boyfriend went to get us drinks I was sitting with his parents. His mom said ‚ÄúSo. You and Robbie, huh?‚Äù She always calls him Robbie and he hates it. I said ‚ÄúYeah, I think he‚Äôs just the greatest.‚Äù Or something like that. She told me she thinks it‚Äôs adorable that we got together and that we make the cutest couple. His dad chimes in that we‚Äôre half a cute couple. Then he gets all serious and says that they both think I‚Äôm a wonderful young woman and there‚Äôs no one else they‚Äôd rather see their son dating!      I actually felt like crying. I think the world of their family and it feels so good to hear them say something like this to me. Then his mom squeezed my hand and said ‚ÄúRobbie really couldn‚Äôt have done any better for himself.‚Äù Ok. Now I really thought I might cry.I thanked them both for always being so kind to me over the years and welcoming me into their family. I really do feel like I‚Äôm a part of their family now.</Content></post><post><Title>What are the best ways to make friends and maybe get a girlfriend from online?</Title><Author>u/Motor_Feed9945</Author><Content>I am 37 M US. Usually the advice given on Reddit (and I imagine most other sites) when trying to make new friends is to go to meet up groups, join hobby groups, volunteer or even just go out to a bar and talk to people. I am looking for both friends and a relationship, so I imagine this applies to both.      As I have gotten older, I have grown even shyer and more sensitive than when I was younger. I have even developed a little bit of a facial tick when out in public. And I will just be blunt- meeting up with strangers or groups like that is a bridge to far for me. And it is not even close. I would remain single and friendless forever before I start doing things like that. I am happy for all the people those things work for. But they are just not for me.      While I was driving this morning, I was thinking of ways I can get around this. It goes without saying it has been a great frustration for me. And I realized if I could meet people online first, maybe communicate with them, exchange a bunch of emails, have both of us be open and honest with each other I would then be comfortable meeting potential friends and dates in public then.      I realize this is not a traditional way of meeting friends/girlfriends, but I think it could work for me. If anyone is curious the only ways I have made friends before was first when I was in kindergarten and I became friends with the three other boys at my table. The second way was when I joined the friend group of my random college roommate. It goes without saying I cannot recreate those experiences in any way.      Although I am very shy and sensitive I am not an agoraphobic at all. I enjoy eating out, going to the movies, kayaking, going on walks and hikes. I am just not able to do it with strangers and be able to strike up a conversation or anything with them.      I am not in any sort of hurry or rush. I live with my parents, and I am close to a couple of other family members. So, I am not deprived of human communication right now. But I think I would really enjoy some friends of mine own. And I have always dreamed of having a girlfriend before.      I think it would be awesome to just be able to email and communicate with another person online, maybe text and try a phone conversation first.      Does anyone have any experience with meeting people this way? Does anyone have any advice or ideas?      I am obviously on Reddit; I post some on YouTube. I do not have a Facebook page, but I am open to getting one. The biggest problem I have had with FB in the past is that well it is not a great website for making new friends. More of a website for communicating with people you already know or have mutual friends with. To someone without friends FB can be a super intimidating place      I would love to know if anyone has any thoughts or ideas on this strategy. The last thing I will say is thinking of this has cheered me up quite a bit. Thank you everyone.      One last thing- I am obviously aware of dating apps. They have never really worked for me in the past. And also, I think I am looking for someone willing to wait longer and have a lot more communication with someone before meeting them than most women from a dating app would be ok with.</Content></post><post><Title>her laugh gives me butterflies ‚ô°</Title><Author>u/blithe-ly</Author><Content>i'm in bed and she's next door working the morning shift (wfh) and I can just hear her chuckling to herself intermittently, and every time she does my tummy does backflips. ugh she just has the most adorable little giggle, she sounds so cheeky &amp;amp; mischievous you just know she's up to something silly and I can't helpbut smile :')</Content></post><post><Title>I call my boyfriend beautiful a lot.

And we stayed like that for a while, holding each other tightly until we slowly loosened our grip and just relaxed into each other. Five minutes later I hear his breathing get a little slower, and he starts lightly snoring and I‚Äôm like hell yes! My baby fell asleep!

We never dated. I loved him deeply, (some might find this weird but) it felt like a love I‚Äôd love my own child with. He was so cruel to me. It threw me into a complete emotional conflict with myself.      How could I love someone who just hurts me? But I did. In time I murdered that love. It took all my strength to neutralize the obsession, then the love, then the anger, and finally all I have left is just some very small traces of who he was to me.      I‚Äôm grateful that I‚Äôm not stuck‚Ä¶ not being able to eat or sleep, being in pain all day long at work, always running to the bathroom to cry, nobody seeming to fill his place‚Ä¶ except the thing is, nobody ever did fill his place. The place still feels unfulfilled. Now I just have less love.      For some odd reason, my love was made of him. And when I got rid of him, a lot of my love just‚Ä¶ kind of went with him.      There is still one person left that I love, I‚Äôve loved her longer than him. I love her in a similar way, but not the exact same. I hope one day to form a new love, but I do fear it will be similar to what I had for him, and that makes me feel sick. What a dilemma.      Love has been one of the worst things that happened in my life, and that sounds so heartbreaking‚Ä¶ and it is heartbreaking. It is maddening to me that whenever I think about him, I still have to feel something, whatever it is that day (sometimes it‚Äôs neutral and okay, but still sometimes I feel disgust, friendship, anger, resentment) most of the feelings left are negative, which also sucks.      I want to enjoy my life to the fullest. I have put a lot of work into this. I have moved on romantically. I have a partner that is kind and caring‚Ä¶ things he never was to me. I am so close to being over what happened, but the last parts are honestly just as hard, because it feels so disappointing to still have to go back to it, even a little bit. And it‚Äôs like an emotional endurance thing where you just are so sick of it and feel like you put in so much work already, it‚Äôs hard to keep doing it.      I have realized life is not what I thought, you just gotta keep living and hang in there and stuff does in some ways get easier, but not always ‚Äúbetter.‚Äù Well this was kinda therapeutic thanks for anyone who reads.

After class I didn‚Äôt want to wake him, so I did other homework and waited. Hours passed and eventually I just decided to snuggle up with him. I thought I‚Äôd get on my phone or something to pass the time.      He wrapped his arm around me, still totally asleep, and snuggled me. I felt so warm and safe and contented. I fell asleep within minutes. I know this doesn‚Äôt sound like anything significant, but I have a lot of trouble napping because I‚Äôm usually too consumed by anxious feelings about work I need to get done.      The fact that I was able to fall asleep so quickly in the middle of the day with him makes me so happy. Hearing his slow breathing and being all wrapped up is so comforting. There‚Äôs really nothing like it. I feel so lucky.      These impromptu naps have happened only a few times, and I look back on every one of them so fondly. It‚Äôs such a rare moment of letting go &amp;amp; relaxing for me and I love that I can have those moments with someone I love so much.      So, yeah. Love is naps.      This is my first post here and personal post on Reddit in general!! My partner is also the one who introduced me to Reddit.

Love is overflowing joy. Love is when you have seen who you are; then there is nothing left except to share your being with others. Love is when you have seen that you are not separate from existence.      Love is when you have felt an organic, orgasmic unity with all that is.      Love is not a relationship. Love is a state of being; it has nothing to do with anybody else. One is not in love, one is love. And of course when one is love, one is in love - but that is an outcome, a by-product, that is not the source. The source is that one is love.      And who can be love? Certainly, if you are not aware of who you are, you cannot be love. You will be fear. Fear is just the opposite of love. Remember, hate is not the opposite of love, as people think; hate is love standing upside down, it is not the opposite of love. The real opposite of love is fear. In love one expands, in fear one shrinks. In fear one becomes closed, in love one opens. In fear one doubts, in love one trusts. In fear one is left lonely, in love one disappears; hence there is no question of loneliness at all. When one is not, how can one be lonely? Then these trees and the birds and the clouds and the sun and the stars are still within you. Love is when you have known your inner sky.</Content></post><post><Title>I had my first kiss on New Year's Eve and I just can't handle itüíó</Title><Author>u/Ishan_Das10</Author><Content>I still can't believe that it actually happened.      Me and my girlfriend were in a NYE party that our fathers' workplace organized. Luckily, her father and my father work at the same company. We were looking forward to this day for weeks if not months.      After a while, we found ourselves in a rooftop of a building. Just us, complete solitude. We talked for a while. It was so cute. And then we danced to "Lover" by Taylor Swift and she taught me how to dance (I suck at dancing). It was so fucking awesome. Cold air, under the starry sky. It was like a dream come true.      Then we were just standing looking at each other, and then she says "Kiss me, you fool". God, it was sooooooooooooo amazing. It was so great that it feels like I've been dreaming.

You never chose to be this way. You didn't choose to be an over thinker.      You wish you didn't have to re-read or take a second to think about what they said. Their words never seem to come out as hurtful but to you, the over thinker; they are and they always will be.      You try your best not to over analyze the things they say but it never works. You take what is said and make the worst of it. When something of minor inconvenience takes hold, it isn't just minor anymore. It engulfs your entire mind to the point where you are overthinking everything.  EveryLastThing.      You start to question everything about the relationship. You let your emotions take over and conquer you.      You‚Äôre worried, aren't you?      You‚Äôre worried that one day your overthinking will be too much and they will leave just like everyone else, right?      You don‚Äôt mean to be clingy. You don't want to become a burden that you think you‚Äôre becoming to them.      So what do you do?      You overthink.      You doubt their love for you is as strong as yours. How could they love you the same? As an over thinker you question everything. You‚Äôre worried about them wanting to be with someone else like when they take too long to respond. ‚ÄúThey must have found someone else‚Äù. As a result; you respond right away because you've been waiting for their response for hours..      You assume that they were talking to someone better. Your mind takes you into a state of emergency of overthinking. Telling you only the wrong things you don't need to hear.    When they‚Äôre too busy to see you, it auto corrects in your mind as ‚Äúthey do not want to see me‚Äù.      Any simple texts can turn into a roller coaster full of over thinking emotions.      Now from everything i've addressed.. Forget about it and take a minute to process what i‚Äôm about to say.      Don‚Äôt go back and re-read what they said.. You have nothing to worry about. Do not doubt their love for you, that hurts their feelings. They just have different ways of showing love than you do.You are not a burden to them, they just have a busy life on top of your relationship. They do love you as much as you do. They haven't responded in a while? Be patient, they want to talk to you they are just busy. When they are too busy to see you, don't take it personally; understand that they will make time when they can. They are trying. So try to understand from their point of view as well. So please do not overthink about your relationship, it isn't healthy for you or your partner.      How do I know this?      Because I have felt the same things.. I have been anxious about not getting a text back in a certain amount of time. I have thought they didn‚Äôt love me anymore because of little things they say. But with that being said, I'm learning (have learned) to not let it control me as much as it used to‚Ä¶  Just remember    Everything will be okay, just breathe.

If so how did you find your significant other?</Title><Author>u/gossipgirl999</Author><Content>Back in 2018 my best friend invited me to celebrate her brother‚Äôs birthday at his best friends‚Äôs house (let‚Äôs call the brothers bff Mark). At the time I was talking to my ex and I had feelings for him and thought he was going to be my person. Now I don‚Äôt remember seeing Mark or talking to Mark that night. But i found a video of that night and he was in it.      Fast forward to February 2023 my ex and I breakup. I left the relationship and thought to myself i wasn‚Äôt going to meet someone that made me feel the way he did, loved, cared for, and safe. I didn‚Äôt think I was able to get intimate with someone the way I did with him.      In May 2023 my best friend‚Äôs brother invited us to celebrate his friend‚Äôs birthday at a club. At the time I remember still grieving my ex, and feeling a little down over my ex.  I didn‚Äôt really want to go out that night either and I didn‚Äôt even look my best.  But i knew i had to be social and just go out and spend time with my friends.      So to my surprise Mark was there that night. I had no idea he was best friends with my bff‚Äôs brother. I didn‚Äôt really pay him much attention because I didn‚Äôt think I looked my best that night either and I didn‚Äôt even drink! All my friends were drinking and me personally if i‚Äôm not in the right mental space I don‚Äôt.      So then Mark tried talking to me and I kinda just didn‚Äôt care. Then he told my bestie he wanted to talk to me and then my best friend pushed me on to him to dance with.      I remember that night we went to Mark‚Äôs house and I went in the bathroom and called my ex hoping he would pick up to get me and take me home. No answer.      Fast forward to 2024 after a year of casually messing around with Mark I feel like when we‚Äôre intimate it feels good. He makes me feel confident and safe. He‚Äôs very affectionate and respect my boundaries. He‚Äôs so in tune with his masculinity and is confident with himself.      Now I just feel like I am trying to allow myself to feel and fall back into my feminine energy and just go with the flow. When we hang out I am working on being affectionate and not play hard to get or hide my attraction for him to be prideful. I simply want to fall back and be affectionate and confident. The intimacy is so good even us just cuddling feels so different but better and more comforting. I feel like with him I don‚Äôt have to worry about feeling insecure about little things that my ex made me self conscious about (like how my hair smelled, morning breath or trying to get intimate in the morning).      I know me and Mark wouldn‚Äôt be anything serious - this is just something casual but allowing myself to feel is just a good feeling and I would‚Äôve never thought that I‚Äôd be feeling like this with this guy. Now i‚Äôm not saying I am vulnerable to catch feelings, more like enjoy the moment for what it is and reciprocate the energy he gives off without having my guard up if that makes sense.      I think the other ironic part is that my best friend‚Äôs ex bf‚Äôs gf used to talk to Mark. Idk to what extent but they were a thing for like a year or 2.      Small world.</Content></post><post><Title>You don't need other people to make your life complete but..</Title><Author>u/PB-N-JAKE</Author><Content>‚ÄúYou don't need another Human Being to make your life complete, but let's be honest.

I'm of South Asian descent and live in America. Currently in grad school and I fell in love with my German classmate. He is the epitome of class and dignity, and I have truly never met anyone like him in my life. I only realized how I felt last month after we shared a dance together, but it was too late.      We graduate in 2 days after which he's going back to Germany and I'll never see him again. Based on my experience with other men, I am pretty conventionally attractive, however It saddned me to realize that although we shared a connection, he probably never saw me as a potential partner. Although we're both Catholic, I'm of a different race and culture, but I cannot fault him for wanting to be with someone who looks like him, speaks his language and understands his German way of life.      He is what I have been looking for, for so long; A God fearing man, who carries himself with integrity and knows how to be a gentleman. A natural born leader who is intelligent and funny too! It doesn't help that he's also cute. I haven't been able to stop thinking of him ever since the evening we shared that dance, and I have spent a many sleepless nights longing for him.      It's crazy cause I never cared for Germany or Germans. I chalked it up to a culture and language that would never have a bearing on my life, yet here I am, wishing he wanted me so I could learn German for him. He was like an eclipse in my life. Beautiful, fascinating and temporary. Every day that inches closer to graduation, is one less day I have him here in the states and it kills me. He has been a gentleman towards me but that's just how he is with everyone.      He never really showed any signs of being interested in me, so I'll forever hold it in, hoping and praying to someday find someone else who's just like him...</Content></post><post><Title>can you be IN LOVE with someone your whole life? or do all marriages just turn into a roommate vibe after a while</Title><Author>Unknown author</Author><Content>im 17f and have just been wondering. i feel like i would be able to be in love with someone my whole life but of course idrk anything about relationships. i see so much stuff on the internet about people cheating and how attraction fades especially if u have a child and ur body changes. i havent really seen any examples of 'true love' in my life. does it really exist?      edit: wow i dint expect this to get so many comments but thank you guys so much! so many of ur stories are so sweet its adorable</Content></post><post><Title>Conversation about what it looks like to not love your own children (non parents welcomed to join)</Title><Author>u/Own-Possession6683</Author><Content>Im struggling to believe and feel I live my son I know love isn‚Äôt much of a feeling but in general I do everything a parents supposed to.

In my mind, when you have feelings for or love somebody, you should be able to come up with a list of things you like/love about them or about what they do for you. Is this a right way to gauge a relationship and potential partner? In my previous relationship my boyfriend‚Äôs dad asked me what I loved about his son, and I struggled to come up with an answer.

I was using crack and heroin and fentanyl and I decided "yo that's enough this has gone way to far I need to stop". So after rehab and Suboxone maintenance here I am, 70 something days sober. But before I got clean I met this girl and me and her hit it off pretty well. I decided that I'd stop the random sex with strangers with my drug habit since honestly that usually went hand and hand.      Now I want to say I've done my fair share of drugs and I will always have a special place in my heart for psychedelics. That's the one thing I'll probably always do, and maybe ecstasy on very special occasions. I also am a huge fan and supporter of DMT.      With that said me and girl spend a lot of time together and she's actually the first person I fell in love with. Like from the moment we first hung out we hit it off like no one I've ever met. It feels like I've always known her. And my favorite thing to do with her is hug...      I know it sounds dumb but like for real, I love sex, I love kissing her, I love making her feel special, but like I REAAAALY love just hugging her. She gives the best hugs and they make me feel AMAZING.      Last night we hugged for a solid 30 or 40 minutes. Just on the beach under the cloudy moon lit sky. Dancing and stumbling all over the cool sand but never breaking our embrace. Hardcore hugging, like full on face buried in shoulder standing in the rain hugging. She holds me like she never wants to let go. And tbh I don't ever want her to! Keep in mind that I'm sober, but I felt kinda like I'm rolling, but not as intense but still like it was crazy. I actually feel high when I'm hugging her.      Before I met her I was sure that nothing could make me feel as good as heroin, but then she came along. Things are going so well we're just in total bliss. I never let anyone in like this, I've never felt like this, Ill love this girl till death.</Content></post><post><Title>Y‚Äôall ever cry over being so deep in love with a person?</Title><Author>u/XDreamX9383</Author><Content>I just sat in my room and cried for a half hour while watching my boyfriend sleep.

I love listening to him, and he enjoys telling stories, so I laid there with my blanket wrapped around me, listening to him tell me different sweet and happy stories. I felt so comfortable and safe in that moment, like nothing could go wrong. It was such a warm, nice feeling.      I told him this, saying how safe, comfortable, and happy I felt. In response, he started saying such kind things. He told me things like: "You're safe now." "I won't let anything hurt you." and "You can rest now."      I've never been told anything like this before. My whole life, I've been used to abuse and hurt. To hear such simple yet kind sentences as these... shook me to my core. I started crying. Words like that were so foreign. They didn't feel like words I was meant to hear, yet he was telling me them.      He began comforting me as I wept softly, but I was mainly holding back. I've never been good at crying in front of anyone. I made a small, joking comment through the tears like, "I wonder how much I'd cry if I didn't hold back." In response, he told me not to hold back, and to just let myself cry and feel the emotions.      And so I did.      Crying has always been a painful thing for me. When I cry, there's a genuine pain deep in my stomach and it makes me cry out both from the sheer mental pain and from the physical pain. It's like the deep hurt I have bottled up takes physical form.      Yet this crying was... gentle. There was no pain, no crying out. Just... happiness. I've never cried happy tears for anything, but in that moment, with the tears streaming down my face and clouding my eyes, that's all I felt. As I listened to his soothing voice tell me everything was going to be okay and that he wouldn't let anything hurt me, I was genuinely happy.      For almost 2 hours afterward, I sobbed as he told me these kind words.      I think a part of me healed that night. The part that didn't think it would ever be possible for me to be treated with this kind of kindness and love. The part of me who didn't think I deserved any. And all I felt was relief. Relief both at so much built up pain being alleviated that night, and at the fact that I have someone who loves me enough to help me deal with this pain.      It was that night that I realized just how much I really loved him. There's nobody else I'd rather spend the rest of my life with, and I know he's the amazing man I'll marry some day.</Content></post><post><Title>My girlfriend said something that made my heart soar</Title><Author>u/bignolan99</Author><Content>She send me a picture of her in a dress and I called her beautiful and asked her why she was in a dress.

I was using crack and heroin and fentanyl and I decided "yo that's enough this has gone way to far I need to stop". So after rehab and Suboxone maintenance here I am, 70 something days sober. But before I got clean I met this girl and me and her hit it off pretty well. I decided that I'd stop the random sex with strangers with my drug habit since honestly that usually went hand and hand.      Now I want to say I've done my fair share of drugs and I will always have a special place in my heart for psychedelics. That's the one thing I'll probably always do, and maybe ecstasy on very special occasions. I also am a huge fan and supporter of DMT.      With that said me and girl spend a lot of time together and she's actually the first person I fell in love with. Like from the moment we first hung out we hit it off like no one I've ever met. It feels like I've always known her. And my favorite thing to do with her is hug...      I know it sounds dumb but like for real, I love sex, I love kissing her, I love making her feel special, but like I REAAAALY love just hugging her. She gives the best hugs and they make me feel AMAZING.      Last night we hugged for a solid 30 or 40 minutes. Just on the beach under the cloudy moon lit sky. Dancing and stumbling all over the cool sand but never breaking our embrace. Hardcore hugging, like full on face buried in shoulder standing in the rain hugging. She holds me like she never wants to let go. And tbh I don't ever want her to! Keep in mind that I'm sober, but I felt kinda like I'm rolling, but not as intense but still like it was crazy. I actually feel high when I'm hugging her.      Before I met her I was sure that nothing could make me feel as good as heroin, but then she came along. Things are going so well we're just in total bliss. I never let anyone in like this, I've never felt like this, Ill love this girl till death.</Content></post><post><Title>Y‚Äôall ever cry over being so deep in love with a person?</Title><Author>u/XDreamX9383</Author><Content>I just sat in my room and cried for a half hour while watching my boyfriend sleep.

He is constantly cleaning or helping me clean and takes over dinner 2-3 times a week. He gives me time to myself when my day is overwhelming and never makes me feel bad for it. Our communication has been so good and it‚Äôs easy to just say what is on my mind without worrying about how he will react. And the cherry on top of it all is the fact that I prefer to sleep with my hair braided, but I can‚Äôt braid.

I love listening to him, and he enjoys telling stories, so I laid there with my blanket wrapped around me, listening to him tell me different sweet and happy stories. I felt so comfortable and safe in that moment, like nothing could go wrong. It was such a warm, nice feeling.      I told him this, saying how safe, comfortable, and happy I felt. In response, he started saying such kind things. He told me things like: "You're safe now." "I won't let anything hurt you." and "You can rest now."      I've never been told anything like this before. My whole life, I've been used to abuse and hurt. To hear such simple yet kind sentences as these... shook me to my core. I started crying. Words like that were so foreign. They didn't feel like words I was meant to hear, yet he was telling me them.      He began comforting me as I wept softly, but I was mainly holding back. I've never been good at crying in front of anyone. I made a small, joking comment through the tears like, "I wonder how much I'd cry if I didn't hold back." In response, he told me not to hold back, and to just let myself cry and feel the emotions.      And so I did.      Crying has always been a painful thing for me. When I cry, there's a genuine pain deep in my stomach and it makes me cry out both from the sheer mental pain and from the physical pain. It's like the deep hurt I have bottled up takes physical form.      Yet this crying was... gentle. There was no pain, no crying out. Just... happiness. I've never cried happy tears for anything, but in that moment, with the tears streaming down my face and clouding my eyes, that's all I felt. As I listened to his soothing voice tell me everything was going to be okay and that he wouldn't let anything hurt me, I was genuinely happy.      For almost 2 hours afterward, I sobbed as he told me these kind words.      I think a part of me healed that night. The part that didn't think it would ever be possible for me to be treated with this kind of kindness and love. The part of me who didn't think I deserved any. And all I felt was relief. Relief both at so much built up pain being alleviated that night, and at the fact that I have someone who loves me enough to help me deal with this pain.      It was that night that I realized just how much I really loved him. There's nobody else I'd rather spend the rest of my life with, and I know he's the amazing man I'll marry some day.</Content></post><post><Title>My girlfriend said something that made my heart soar</Title><Author>u/bignolan99</Author><Content>She send me a picture of her in a dress and I called her beautiful and asked her why she was in a dress.

It‚Äôs the same with family and friends. They may criticize you because they want you to be happy. But filtered through lack, the message of love is lost. Trying to use negativity to inspire positivity doesn‚Äôt work as a long-term solution.  Self-love = Focusing on anything that helps you feel a little better.    So you don't have to focus on what you like about yourself if that feels challenging. Instead, if you focus on what you liked about a sunny day or cute animals (i.e. subjects that are easier for you to focus on what you like), then that will naturally carry over into helping you like yourself more.      Also note the Self-Love Paradox: To truly love yourself, you are okay with those times when you don‚Äôt. You have self-compassion for when you don‚Äôt take care of yourself.      .  How to Love Yourself1. Connect with Your Body.‚ÄúWhat do you need today, body? You support me a lot, so how may I serve and support you?‚Äù (E.g. Drink plenty of water, deep breathing, grounding work and felt sense, better quality sleep, healthier diet, hug yourself, put your hand on your heart, pay more attention to your five senses, and move your body ‚Äî dancing, exercise, stretching, etc.).  2. Connect with Nature.Your body came from Earth, so you‚Äôre literally connecting with your roots. (E.g. Go for a walk, hiking, the beach, walk barefoot in dirt, buy and take care of or interact with plants, listen to nature sounds, and/or go outside and get at least 10 - 15 minutes of sunlight each day.).  3. Connect with Your Negative Emotions.Negative emotions are positive guidance (although it might not feel that way) letting you know you are focusing on (and pushing against or judging) what you don't want. Negative emotions are just messengers of limiting beliefs you're practicing. They're a necessary part of your emotional guidance, like GPS in your car. But the more you fight them, you keep yourself stuck.  All emotions are equal and worthy. But most people unknowingly create a hierarchy for their emotions (i.e. positive = good; negative = bad), but then you make it harder to feel better. Begin seeing negative emotions as worthy, valuable and supportive friends, and work together as a team to help you feel better.  4. Connect with Your Creativity.You have unique energy that needs to be expressed. Find creative outlets to express yourself (e.g. dancing, singing, writing, drawing, painting, etc.). Experiment with different creative outlets until you find ones you resonate with.  5. Connect with Your Spiritual Side.Meditate for 2 - 15 minutes every day (either listening to guided meditations, nature sounds, or in peace and quiet).      ~ BFree      .

It might sound weird, but all of us are going through troubling times. One friends mom has cancer, the other friend has some soul searching to do, and we've been friends for half our lives. My personal journey is purely finding myself and coming to an understanding of who I am and the inherent fact that being is okay because there's nothing else to do. Anyway.      Scent has taught me a bit what love is. How love is. Platonically. Romantically. The works. And the platonic love for my friends really is making me see things in a new light with scent. When the one friend opens up and is usually sitting next to me, I can smell his vulnerability if that makes sense. It's usually a smell that eminates when he can finally release all his frustrations, and it calms me in a way that lets me be empathical to his plight. And this really has helped create a back and forth that strengthened our friendship more than ever.      The same goes for the other friend as well. And in general, while they always had specific "scents", it's funny how I'm now able to sorta pick up on their moods now and it helping me be the best possible version of myself for each situation based on it. Like there's tiny fluctuations and variations to the base scent that I can pick up on that sorta tells me the ups and downs of how they're feeling.      I just wanna say how much I love and cherish my friends, cause they've always helped me without realizing it, without feeling it, and now I can give back in tenfoldw for all the years they've put up with me. My senses are finally working and tuning themselves, and I now know what love is.

I am an anime geek so perhaps someone else who is an anime geek, like owning pokemon/Yu-Gi-Oh cards, gundams, etc.      Do I need to make more money to sustain a relationship. I don't make the most money admittedly but I know being financially stable is a plus.      And what should I do in the case I do find someone? I always hear "be yourself" but a part of me feels it Is quite cliche.      I might have others but I think this is a start. Thank you for any following advice</Content></post><post><Title>Mornings together</Title><Author>u/rooooosa</Author><Content>He is in my bed, snoring away as I type on my computer, sat at the table next to him.

What do I do?</Title><Author>u/mrconjust</Author><Content>My(26m) gf (25f) broke up with me the second time in a week today over a past argument      She was already getting in her head a lot thinking I don‚Äôt care and don‚Äôt want to talk to her but I said that couldn‚Äôt be further from the truth. I always made time, always responded promptly to her calls and texts and never made her feel unheard or disrespected      I suggested we keep our phone calls to before 8pm because I want to start bettering my life and making more money so we could move out of our parents places and have a future. She was hurt by that because she felt I didn‚Äôt care, and left my stuff by my door. I gave her the weekend to cool off and we were able to reconcile on Monday the 6th      I was elated to finally have it behind us. We spent the night getting intimate and watching our shows together, doing our typical activities. Spent the 7th shopping and went to the gym and she left for work on the 8th      Last night we had a fun phone conversation as usual, nothing out of the ordinary. We said our I love yous and went to bed. This morning she asked if she could come by and get her picnic basket because she had a new girl co worker and they wanted to picnic before work. She stopped by just this morning around 11am      She was happy to see me. We talk about next Friday as a date night and she seemed excited. We talk about doing the gym as usual tonight. Just as we were putting everything in her car she said ‚ÄúHow do you feel about the way you‚Äôve treated me in this relationship?‚Äù      I was a little taken aback but I said ‚ÄúI feel I‚Äôve done my best in making sure I reciprocate the love you give me. There‚Äôs always room for improvement, especially for me, but I hope I‚Äôve made you feel happy.‚Äù      She said ‚ÄúYou have but‚Ä¶idk. I think someone who loves me wouldn‚Äôt have made me feel unworthy of a phone call. And I‚Ä¶ I think I‚Äôm done.‚Äù      I saw this as she needed me to reassure her more so I said ‚ÄúI know how that made you feel and I hate that I said it. But I just want to reaffirm that I always want to hear from you baby, I think about you all the time.‚Äù      She kept saying something similar and about how she needed to go. We made out, held each other close and kissed very passionately. She drove off with tears in her eyes and blew me a kiss. I‚Äôm still in shock that this all happened just a couple hours ago. The love of my life walked out on me just like that, and so sudden too. Deleted our pictures on Instagram too. What do you guys think? That maybe there is someone else? Should I try and reach out to her or give her time?      TL;DR: Gf gets in her head that I don‚Äôt want to talk but that couldn‚Äôt be further from the truth and now she‚Äôs broken up. How do I get her back</Content></post><post><Title>If you see this I love you</Title><Author>u/SerBrendanhouseSaint</Author><Content>My girlfriend sometimes stalks my reddit when shes at work or bored.

Both Married And Non Married.</Title><Author>u/instantwins24</Author><Content>Appreciate your spouse while they‚Äôre alive. Nobody‚Äôs perfect, I know that.      I know couples argue and have disagreements on things. That‚Äôs part of every relationship, both married and non married, is it not?      Appreciate having your husband or wife, boyfriend or girlfriend with you while they‚Äôre alive. The little things and the big things. They both matter.      For example, like helping around the home, or taking care of the kid(s). If you have any, that is.      Marriage and relationships aren‚Äôt always perfect. That‚Äôs the beauty of it. It‚Äôs imperfect. Because we, as people, are imperfect. We make mistakes, we hurt each other.      But we also forgive and love each other. Nobody‚Äôs immortal. For some of us, you‚Äôll never know how good you had it until it‚Äôs too late. Taken for granted.      Appreciate your spouse. The way they talk, their smile, their voice, their actions, the intimacy between you both. The little things and the big things.      Never go to bed angry. Instead, work it out the next day with sleep and a clear mind.      As someone with parents who don‚Äôt and didn‚Äôt have the best marriage or relationship, I IMPLORE you to find time to appreciate your spouse.      You don‚Äôt have to say it out loud or to them. But, maybe, to remind yourself of why you fell in love with and married them.      And take some time to be kinder to eachother.      It doesn't matter how mad you are at eachother, there's always room to show kindness.      Our time on this world is limited. Please don‚Äôt take it for granted. Use it wisely.</Content></post><post><Title>I am the happiest I've ever been because of my boyfriend!</Title><Author>u/Knuckles-the-ech1dna</Author><Content>I (25f) have known my boyfriend (32m) since January of this year. We have been together 'officially' for a very quick seven months but have always had a flirtatiuos relationship with each other from the start. I remember the first time I saw him I thought he was so attractive, everyone else who knew him was so excited to see him so he seemed very friendly and personable. Fast-forward to where we are at now and I could have never imagined my life turning out like it is now. I stay with him about 90% of the time and every time I look at him I want to physically cry from how happy I am. I can't remember the last time I have felt this genuinely happy. I recently went through a bad concussion that affected my blood pressure (weird, I know) and I could barely even walk ten feet without nearly passing out which meant I couldn't work out like I'm use to and that was super hard for me. I spent so much time crying from stress/pain and all that and he never left my side if he didn't have to. He was overly caring and I had never felt so loved in my life. His parents were even calling to check in on me and I had never felt like a partner's parents had cared so much. Everytime I look at my bf I am amazed at how lucky I got to be with him. I love watching him play his video games and seeing him so happy. His laugh is the best sound to me and he always hold me so tightly. I love going with him to run little errands because I love being able to be seen with him in public. He will always give me butterflies and I have never felt my heart so full for someone. I just wanted to tell someone/anyone/everyone about how happy I am because I am so in love and can't wait to marry this man and grow our own little family!</Content></post><post><Title>I'm probably too young to say, but I hope I can stay with her forever, I haven't committed to much, but maybe I can commit to her</Title><Author>u/Ok-Outside1031</Author><Content>Yesterday me and her shared 2 bags of different types of hot chips we got from class behavior points. I wrote her 2 notes, I gave her a cute card with cats on it, I showed her a little fold up joke thing I made from a weirdly shaped piece of paper.      I made her laugh so many times yesterday, she was beautiful before, during and after each one. She was drawing, normally she likes quiet when doing that but she wanted me to yap more, even when I had nothing to actually say. I love her, so much. She loves me too.      She asked me, when sitting on the floor with me while I was sick in the middle of our third period english class, she asked me that if I wouldn't leave the world with her, that if I wouldn't let her kill herself alone either, could we just stick together no matter what. Of course I said yes, I was already planning on it.      I love her so much. So fucking much. I didn't even know her for half the school year, we only learned eachothers names on february 1st, its may 11 and I think we'd die for eachother. She's my best friend. Sometimes I love her so hard I wonder if it's still platonic, but it is, it's just my first time truly having a best friend.      I'd hold her hand right now to make sure her heart were still beating, her body still warm and her still alive. She can change her favorite color, hobbies, home, gender, name, whatever, I'd still love her.

She told me about a level where she could not get through. She showed me how hard it was and told me that she had asked a lot of friends to help her beat it, but no one could. I wanted to try to beat it for her, but the first time I failed too. Then I tried to switch my approach,  which made me fully focus on the buttons. I only knew I was doing well because of the excitement i heard in my girlfriends voice. I succeeded and my girlfriend was so euphoric that she told me that she loved me.      We never had said this to each other, so she instantly turned red and it looked like she was shocked that it just slipped out. I asked her if she really meant it and she said, yes I do, which made her turn even more red.      I felt totally no doubt at all and I told her I loved her too. We both started smiling at each other and I kissed her. I felt such a warm feeling from inside, I never felt something like it.

And, I don't mean soulmates in the strictest sense of the word but just the kind of love for another person that transcends any other material desires. I used to think I had that kind of bond with somebody, where our souls were invariably connected to each others. He felt strongly about me in that sense too, but our story was always incomplete because we met online and never really met. I told him i couldn't be with me because of the distance and eventually got into a relationship with somebody else.      I couldn't survive that relationship though and it ended because I could never get really get over him and would keep needing him in my life. There was a point where all of this got too much for me and I took a break from everything (about 2 months).BTW the timeline is a bit weird, at this point we have liked each other for about 2 years.      But when I came back, he had "moved on" gotten into a relationship with somebody else and showed no affection for me whatsoever in the way he spoke to me. I was also going through a really difficult time when I reached out to him again due to my mothers sickness but he completely shut me off and ignored me for this new girl he had met.      Though, I pushed him away many times, there was always a certain care and consideration in my words. If not that, at least a kind of hope for a future together even if we couldn't be in each others lives now.      when i found out he started dating someone else I felt betrayed more than anything else. We never verbally made the decision to wait for each other - but the things he said to me made me feel like he could never possibly love anyone else like this - how could it be possible? It's true we never met, but is it really that easy to move on from that feeling, the feeling of two souls being deeply connected?      Sometimes, i cannot believe I trusted his words and kept my eyes filled with the dreams of a future together. The way he acts with me now, it feels as if there was nothing between us. We have no contact whatsoever. In fact, he didn't even check up on me after I told him of my mothers sickness, which hurt me more because he didn't even try to be my friend. To be clear, I don't hate him for moving on. I still care for him and i understand it must have been lonely. After all, i dated people too after we had been together. I don't blame him, truly I don't, but somewhere there is this disbelief over his loss.      I used to believe in the idea of soulmates because of him. That no matter how many years pass by or how much the distance is, nobody else could ever touch us the way we had touched each other. I just wanna know from everyone else's experience, that is it stupid of me to chase after that feeling again?      I am not doubtful of the fact that I can find a comfortable companionship with somebody someday. I just wanna know if the kind of soul-mate connection I always dreamed of, and even felt to some extent, is possible to have with someone.      I am certain, now, that he is not the one for me because of the ease with which he has discarded me from his life. But is it stupid of me to expect a true 'soulmate' from the universe one day?      TL;DR: I used to believe in soulmates because of a deep connection with someone I met online, but things ended when I couldn't commit due to distance. He moved on quickly, making me doubt if such connections exist. Now I wonder if I'll find the same, if not better, connection again or if it's silly to hope for one.</Content></post><post><Title>IT HAPPENED, WE FINALLY SAID I LOVE YOU!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</Title><Author>Unknown author</Author><Content>Ahhhhhhhhh      So it finally happened. My girlfriend and I have been together for a little over 6 months and have known each other for a year. Due to it being her sister's birthday and a holiday the following week, I decided to plan a celebration this weekend.      I made her a little trailer to advertise our anniversary. I used the Black Widow trailer and near the end, it cuts to me with a photo collage of us together and advertising our two-night event.      The first night was okay, the internet made the video quality of our video call grainy and it kept cutting in and out. Even with that, I sent her the mixtape I made her (with songs that we both shared) and she loved it! Okay, moving on to the big event.      Yesterday was our big event and after discussing our relationship and how far we've come, she told me she had a surprise for me at 11:59pm. Woah. I told her I did too (maybe a mistake on my part because she was expecting something, DARN IT!!!) and we danced, watched a movie and played games to pass the time.      So, at 12:01am, after freshening up in the bathroom we got to the bathroom. I got back to the phone and after a little pause, she says "I kinda, sorta, am 100% in love with you." She sent me her beautiful gift and I was happy!      Then, I asked if it was my turn to share with her and she said yes. I prepared a four page speech (which was going to actually be a letter, but I just decided to read it to her). In the letter, it was very personal and heartfelt. I told her I love her.      She, teary-eyed, paused and said..."I love you too."      I cried, we all cried. It was sooooo beautiful.      She then said "I knew since February."      *sobs*      We spent the rest of the night talking about the ways we were planning on saying it. Then we went to sleep at the same time, we didn't hang up and we woke up and continued the conversation.      I will never forget this special moment. Thank you so much, V. I love you so much!      That's it.</Content></post><post><Title>How did you know you were loved by your spouse / gf / bf ?</Title><Author>u/AnyRun806</Author><Content>Feeling a little low lately and loosing faith in love even though I haven't been in a relationship.

Usually the advice given on Reddit (and I imagine most other sites) when trying to make new friends is to go to meet up groups, join hobby groups, volunteer or even just go out to a bar and talk to people. I am looking for both friends and a relationship, so I imagine this applies to both.      As I have gotten older, I have grown even shyer and more sensitive than when I was younger. I have even developed a little bit of a facial tick when out in public. And I will just be blunt- meeting up with strangers or groups like that is a bridge to far for me. And it is not even close. I would remain single and friendless forever before I start doing things like that. I am happy for all the people those things work for. But they are just not for me.      While I was driving this morning, I was thinking of ways I can get around this. It goes without saying it has been a great frustration for me. And I realized if I could meet people online first, maybe communicate with them, exchange a bunch of emails, have both of us be open and honest with each other I would then be comfortable meeting potential friends and dates in public then.      I realize this is not a traditional way of meeting friends/girlfriends, but I think it could work for me. If anyone is curious the only ways I have made friends before was first when I was in kindergarten and I became friends with the three other boys at my table. The second way was when I joined the friend group of my random college roommate. It goes without saying I cannot recreate those experiences in any way.      Although I am very shy and sensitive I am not an agoraphobic at all. I enjoy eating out, going to the movies, kayaking, going on walks and hikes. I am just not able to do it with strangers and be able to strike up a conversation or anything with them.      I am not in any sort of hurry or rush. I live with my parents, and I am close to a couple of other family members. So, I am not deprived of human communication right now. But I think I would really enjoy some friends of mine own. And I have always dreamed of having a girlfriend before.      I think it would be awesome to just be able to email and communicate with another person online, maybe text and try a phone conversation first.      Does anyone have any experience with meeting people this way? Does anyone have any advice or ideas?      I am obviously on Reddit; I post some on YouTube. I do not have a Facebook page, but I am open to getting one. The biggest problem I have had with FB in the past is that well it is not a great website for making new friends. More of a website for communicating with people you already know or have mutual friends with. To someone without friends FB can be a super intimidating place      I would love to know if anyone has any thoughts or ideas on this strategy. The last thing I will say is thinking of this has cheered me up quite a bit. Thank you everyone.      One last thing- I am obviously aware of dating apps. They have never really worked for me in the past. And also, I think I am looking for someone willing to wait longer and have a lot more communication with someone before meeting them than most women from a dating app would be ok with.</Content></post><post><Title>Welcome, love birds!</Title><Author>u/AlarmedSunflower</Author><Content>This sub has grown so much and so have all of us!

We never dated. I loved him deeply, (some might find this weird but) it felt like a love I‚Äôd love my own child with. He was so cruel to me. It threw me into a complete emotional conflict with myself.      How could I love someone who just hurts me? But I did. In time I murdered that love. It took all my strength to neutralize the obsession, then the love, then the anger, and finally all I have left is just some very small traces of who he was to me.      I‚Äôm grateful that I‚Äôm not stuck‚Ä¶ not being able to eat or sleep, being in pain all day long at work, always running to the bathroom to cry, nobody seeming to fill his place‚Ä¶ except the thing is, nobody ever did fill his place. The place still feels unfulfilled. Now I just have less love.      For some odd reason, my love was made of him. And when I got rid of him, a lot of my love just‚Ä¶ kind of went with him.      There is still one person left that I love, I‚Äôve loved her longer than him. I love her in a similar way, but not the exact same. I hope one day to form a new love, but I do fear it will be similar to what I had for him, and that makes me feel sick. What a dilemma.      Love has been one of the worst things that happened in my life, and that sounds so heartbreaking‚Ä¶ and it is heartbreaking. It is maddening to me that whenever I think about him, I still have to feel something, whatever it is that day (sometimes it‚Äôs neutral and okay, but still sometimes I feel disgust, friendship, anger, resentment) most of the feelings left are negative, which also sucks.      I want to enjoy my life to the fullest. I have put a lot of work into this. I have moved on romantically. I have a partner that is kind and caring‚Ä¶ things he never was to me. I am so close to being over what happened, but the last parts are honestly just as hard, because it feels so disappointing to still have to go back to it, even a little bit. And it‚Äôs like an emotional endurance thing where you just are so sick of it and feel like you put in so much work already, it‚Äôs hard to keep doing it.      I have realized life is not what I thought, you just gotta keep living and hang in there and stuff does in some ways get easier, but not always ‚Äúbetter.‚Äù Well this was kinda therapeutic thanks for anyone who reads.

Love is overflowing joy. Love is when you have seen who you are; then there is nothing left except to share your being with others. Love is when you have seen that you are not separate from existence.      Love is when you have felt an organic, orgasmic unity with all that is.      Love is not a relationship. Love is a state of being; it has nothing to do with anybody else. One is not in love, one is love. And of course when one is love, one is in love - but that is an outcome, a by-product, that is not the source. The source is that one is love.      And who can be love? Certainly, if you are not aware of who you are, you cannot be love. You will be fear. Fear is just the opposite of love. Remember, hate is not the opposite of love, as people think; hate is love standing upside down, it is not the opposite of love. The real opposite of love is fear. In love one expands, in fear one shrinks. In fear one becomes closed, in love one opens. In fear one doubts, in love one trusts. In fear one is left lonely, in love one disappears; hence there is no question of loneliness at all. When one is not, how can one be lonely?

I notice my partner gets pretty sad every time mothers day season rolls around. I'm having a really hard time in my life right mow and he's been super helpful. We've been together 2 years and some change. I 30/f really would like to do something to honor my boyfriend's 30/m mom who passed away before I met him but I want to approach it carefully. He speaks fondly of her and I just want him to know I'm here for him. Is there a sweet gesture I can do for mothers day? I was going to buy flowers for him in her honor and maybe write a letter.

However, I met a girl that I‚Äôm so in love with, that I couldn‚Äôt ever imagine something like that separating her from me. When I‚Äôm with her is the only time a pessimistic agnostic like me feels that there‚Äôs more to this world than just existing. I feel like she‚Äôs my person. The person I‚Äôm supposed to spend the rest of my life with. The person who I feel was dropped in it for some reason other than happenstance.      The person that makes me feel like death is no longer something that just ‚Äúhappens‚Äù but something so cold and cruel that it could take away a love like ours. She‚Äôs the person that makes me wish that this life on earth isn‚Äôt all that I‚Äôll have with her.</Content></post><post><Title>Yesterday my boyfriend kissed my tears while I was breaking down</Title><Author>u/Specialist_Jump7987</Author><Content>Yesterday I was having a breakdown in bed, because birth control is messing my hormones so bad, while my boyfriend was hugging me and trying to let me know I was safe and I could cry with him.

If so how did you find your significant other?</Title><Author>u/gossipgirl999</Author><Content>Back in 2018 my best friend invited me to celebrate her brother‚Äôs birthday at his best friends‚Äôs house (let‚Äôs call the brothers bff Mark). At the time I was talking to my ex and I had feelings for him and thought he was going to be my person. Now I don‚Äôt remember seeing Mark or talking to Mark that night. But i found a video of that night and he was in it.      Fast forward to February 2023 my ex and I breakup. I left the relationship and thought to myself i wasn‚Äôt going to meet someone that made me feel the way he did, loved, cared for, and safe. I didn‚Äôt think I was able to get intimate with someone the way I did with him.      In May 2023 my best friend‚Äôs brother invited us to celebrate his friend‚Äôs birthday at a club. At the time I remember still grieving my ex, and feeling a little down over my ex.  I didn‚Äôt really want to go out that night either and I didn‚Äôt even look my best.  But i knew i had to be social and just go out and spend time with my friends.      So to my surprise Mark was there that night. I had no idea he was best friends with my bff‚Äôs brother. I didn‚Äôt really pay him much attention because I didn‚Äôt think I looked my best that night either and I didn‚Äôt even drink! All my friends were drinking and me personally if i‚Äôm not in the right mental space I don‚Äôt.      So then Mark tried talking to me and I kinda just didn‚Äôt care. Then he told my bestie he wanted to talk to me and then my best friend pushed me on to him to dance with.      I remember that night we went to Mark‚Äôs house and I went in the bathroom and called my ex hoping he would pick up to get me and take me home. No answer.      Fast forward to 2024 after a year of casually messing around with Mark I feel like when we‚Äôre intimate it feels good. He makes me feel confident and safe. He‚Äôs very affectionate and respect my boundaries. He‚Äôs so in tune with his masculinity and is confident with himself.      Now I just feel like I am trying to allow myself to feel and fall back into my feminine energy and just go with the flow. When we hang out I am working on being affectionate and not play hard to get or hide my attraction for him to be prideful. I simply want to fall back and be affectionate and confident. The intimacy is so good even us just cuddling feels so different but better and more comforting. I feel like with him I don‚Äôt have to worry about feeling insecure about little things that my ex made me self conscious about (like how my hair smelled, morning breath or trying to get intimate in the morning).      I know me and Mark wouldn‚Äôt be anything serious - this is just something casual but allowing myself to feel is just a good feeling and I would‚Äôve never thought that I‚Äôd be feeling like this with this guy. Now i‚Äôm not saying I am vulnerable to catch feelings, more like enjoy the moment for what it is and reciprocate the energy he gives off without having my guard up if that makes sense.      I think the other ironic part is that my best friend‚Äôs ex bf‚Äôs gf used to talk to Mark. Idk to what extent but they were a thing for like a year or 2.      Small world.</Content></post><post><Title>She woke up early, texted me "I miss you" and falls back to sleep</Title><Author>u/muuhfi</Author><Content>If this is not true love, I don't know what is.

I'm of South Asian descent and live in America. Currently in grad school and I fell in love with my German classmate. He is the epitome of class and dignity, and I have truly never met anyone like him in my life. I only realized how I felt last month after we shared a dance together, but it was too late.      We graduate in 2 days after which he's going back to Germany and I'll never see him again. Based on my experience with other men, I am pretty conventionally attractive, however It saddned me to realize that although we shared a connection, he probably never saw me as a potential partner. Although we're both Catholic, I'm of a different race and culture, but I cannot fault him for wanting to be with someone who looks like him, speaks his language and understands his German way of life.      He is what I have been looking for, for so long; A God fearing man, who carries himself with integrity and knows how to be a gentleman. A natural born leader who is intelligent and funny too! It doesn't help that he's also cute. I haven't been able to stop thinking of him ever since the evening we shared that dance, and I have spent a many sleepless nights longing for him.      It's crazy cause I never cared for Germany or Germans. I chalked it up to a culture and language that would never have a bearing on my life, yet here I am, wishing he wanted me so I could learn German for him. He was like an eclipse in my life. Beautiful, fascinating and temporary. Every day that inches closer to graduation, is one less day I have him here in the states and it kills me. He has been a gentleman towards me but that's just how he is with everyone.      He never really showed any signs of being interested in me, so I'll forever hold it in, hoping and praying to someday find someone else who's just like him...</Content></post><post><Title>I get high on her hugs!</Title><Author>u/fuckeddDOWN</Author><Content>So not to long ago I got clean. I was using crack and heroin and fentanyl and I decided "yo that's enough this has gone way to far I need to stop". So after rehab and Suboxone maintenance here I am, 70 something days sober. But before I got clean I met this girl and me and her hit it off pretty well. I decided that I'd stop the random sex with strangers with my drug habit since honestly that usually went hand and hand.      Now I want to say I've done my fair share of drugs and I will always have a special place in my heart for psychedelics. That's the one thing I'll probably always do, and maybe ecstasy on very special occasions. I also am a huge fan and supporter of DMT.      With that said me and girl spend a lot of time together and she's actually the first person I fell in love with. Like from the moment we first hung out we hit it off like no one I've ever met. It feels like I've always known her. And my favorite thing to do with her is hug...      I know it sounds dumb but like for real, I love sex, I love kissing her, I love making her feel special, but like I REAAAALY love just hugging her. She gives the best hugs and they make me feel AMAZING.      Last night we hugged for a solid 30 or 40 minutes. Just on the beach under the cloudy moon lit sky. Dancing and stumbling all over the cool sand but never breaking our embrace. Hardcore hugging, like full on face buried in shoulder standing in the rain hugging. She holds me like she never wants to let go. And tbh I don't ever want her to! Keep in mind that I'm sober, but I felt kinda like I'm rolling, but not as intense but still like it was crazy. I actually feel high when I'm hugging her.      Before I met her I was sure that nothing could make me feel as good as heroin, but then she came along. Things are going so well we're just in total bliss. I never let anyone in like this, I've never felt like this, Ill love this girl till death.</Content></post><post><Title>I‚Äôm thinking of ending my marriage of nearly two decades</Title><Author>Unknown author</Author><Content>I met the love of my life, knew I was going to marry her from the moment I saw her. Fought for her and married her less than a year later. My life was complete. I was the happiest guy on earth. This lasted for 10 years where I knew we had the kind of bond you see in movies. Nothing could ever tear us apart. It was us against the world.      Then we decided to start a family. Immediately after she gave birth her whole demeanour towards me changed overnight. Gone were the constant moments of affection, the closeness we had on a daily basis, the sex, everything. I put it down to hormonal changes as giving birth is a big ordeal after all, and I gave her time. Lots of time. When after 3 years nothing changed, I sat her down and told her how I felt and how she made me feel. Like I was a stranger in my own house. Like I was living with a room mate who were only acquaintances with no romantic ties, hell without a proper friendship. I was expecting her to say she didn‚Äôt feel the same about me anymore, but to my surprise she said she hadn‚Äôt noticed!! She said she would try harder, and that was that. Nothing changed and we continued our surreal coexistence where nothing made sense to me. I suggested we see a marriage councillor to try and help. At first she agreed, but when d-day arrived she refused to take part.      Fast forward another 3 years and I‚Äôm at my wits end. Unconditional love has turned into resentment. Joyful moments throughout the day where we exchanged a kiss or a touch or even a look has turned into a depressing nightmare for me where I feel utterly rejected and useless as a husband. I feel like the only reason I‚Äôm still needed is when I have to do things for her. Like fix her car, or build her some furniture or run errands. I don‚Äôt get anything in return that makes it feel worthwhile to be married to her anymore.      I don‚Äôt ask for much. All I want is my wife back, to feel wanted and loved. But I‚Äôm getting nothing. At this point the resentment has grown so much that I don‚Äôt think I could trust it even if she magically decided to treat me like she used to. So here I am contemplating ending our marriage. Not because there‚Äôs someone else. I don‚Äôt know if I could ever trust anyone else. All I know is I will be happier on my own because I won‚Äôt be reminded every day of what my life used to be like. The only thing stopping me is our daughter. She is the light of my life and I would rather be unhappy so she doesn‚Äôt have to be. She loves us both equally and she knows something is up because she is forever trying to bring us closer together, even though she‚Äôs only 6.      People say it‚Äôs better for kids if break up with your partner than be in a toxic relationship around them. And I agree. The only thing is we are perfectly pleasant towards one another. We never fight or scream and shout. My wife seems perfectly happy with the current arrangement as she is always on a high. And I would be over the moon for her, but not at my expense and my happiness.      I‚Äôm thinking I should give this a final chance and say to her I‚Äôm about to end it unless she agrees to some councilling, to see if this marriage can be saved. Other than that I don‚Äôt see what other options I have but to walk out of this marriage. Love was always enough for me. It was my only requirement, and without it I have no reason to stay.      If anyone has any insight or went through something similar I would be grateful for a bit of guidance as it scares the shit out of me.</Content></post><post><Title>Conversation about what it looks like to not love your own children (non parents welcomed to join)</Title><Author>u/Own-Possession6683</Author><Content>Im struggling to believe and feel I live my son I know love isn‚Äôt much of a feeling but in general I do everything a parents supposed to.

I always looked bad in some way. But I catch him checking me out when I'm doing nothing. Whether I'm standing around, or get up for the washroom, his eyes are on me. At first, I imagined it was because the relationship was fresh, but over a year later, he still does it like he always has. Even when he is deep in his games, he will take a moment to appreciate me.

In my mind, when you have feelings for or love somebody, you should be able to come up with a list of things you like/love about them or about what they do for you. Is this a right way to gauge a relationship and potential partner? In my previous relationship my boyfriend‚Äôs dad asked me what I loved about his son, and I struggled to come up with an answer. Sure enough that relationship ended after several months and now that I‚Äôm out of it I‚Äôve realized that I never actually loved him, I loved the idea of him and the idea of having that kind of relationship in my life.</Content></post><post><Title>Hey, you are not hard to love.

He is constantly cleaning or helping me clean and takes over dinner 2-3 times a week. He gives me time to myself when my day is overwhelming and never makes me feel bad for it. Our communication has been so good and it‚Äôs easy to just say what is on my mind without worrying about how he will react. And the cherry on top of it all is the fact that I prefer to sleep with my hair braided, but I can‚Äôt braid.

Why does he get a kick when i get anxious for his safety?</Title><Author>u/Dazzling_Ant_6881</Author><Content>I decided to ghost a guy friend because he became too much for me. I find that he is so self-destructive he can bring me down with him if I get too close.      For context, I got really mad at him because he got into an accident which caused him to break some bones and I only learned it when he messaged me that he traveled to God knows where. I was extremely in high anxiety when he delivered the news and I was asking where he was, was he with someone. Well, he never told me where he was. He only explained he did drive because he wants to learn how to. I told him he should have known he is not good at it and why do it.      Previous to this, we have been emotionally dependent to each other for 3 months where he would always act as like my doctor when im sick and he always takes care of me. But, i can never forget the times when he lied to me, told me that he was living with a room mate who was abusive when in fact it was his partner. I only knew about it through a mutual friend of ours. He is not transparent at all with me and I'm suppose to be close to him and all.  Whenever we talk in the past, he always makes sure to go out of his house because he said someone might hear.      I clearly remembered a time in the past when he also said he feared for his life with an abusive ex and also dragged me in the situation by texting me and asking me for help. By the way, he still stayed with the ex for sometime and i think they are still together and could be the reason why he broke his bone.      It feels like he gets a kick when he puts me in a high anxiety mode for his safety so dropping him is the best option at this point.      I told him i dont know what to say when he delivered the news. I got tired because it did not feel like it was a friendship anymore. I felt like i was a mistress of some sort.</Content></post><post><Title>Love is so much better then the movies.</Title><Author>Unknown author</Author><Content>I remember as a kid watching romantic movies and shit like that, because I (M now 18) was so damn bored, and I always thought like man, everything works out so perfectly in these movies, love must be so great, and then when I got into a healthy relationship I realized how different love is, there‚Äôs so much fun, and laughing it was just so misrepresented to me, and holy shit it‚Äôs just Infinitely better then I ever could have imagined.      My partner (F 18) is asleep next to me and just looking at her, I know there‚Äôs nothing I wouldn‚Äôt do for her, I want to be there protecting her from anything that might hurt her, and I feel protected by her, I love her with absolutely everything that I have.

I‚Äôve been having some bad anxiety about some other stuff and this got to me so bad I had to go sit outside of our apartment for the next 20 minutes until my partner got home (they were already on their way). Once they got home they went and tossed our whole room for almost an hour just to try to find the spider and then later on when I said I couldn‚Äôt sleep in our room because I was still too freaked they said they wanted to sleep in the living room with me and even went in to our room and got my pjs and some blankets and shook them out to make sure they were spider free. I feel so lucky to have someone in my life who loves me so much and happily spends so much time and energy protecting me even if it‚Äôs just from something that‚Äôs smaller than my stupid thumb, and who never treats me like I‚Äôm foolish.

I am a self confessed love bomber. I shower my partner with love, which for an autistic man, I think he deals with remarkably well. But, I have absolutely pulled back and I also can read his signals when he is not comfortable.  This can be from giving him some space, to giving him a kiss on his cheek not a kiss on the lips and a cuddle.  Other times, he wants a cuddle of his own accord, BUT it comes from him.      My love language would be to receive more compliments/words of love. But that isn't him. So I don't demand them.      His way of showing love is the way he looks after me. The way he looks at me sometimes. And when he does tell me he loves me or that I look gorgeous, I know he means it and it isn't coming from a place of duty, knowing it what I want versus what he wants to say.      I feel adored. And it isn't about love languages. It is the way he shows me this is his own way.      So what I'm saying is look for the ways your partner shows you naturally what he thinks of you. How he shows he loves you.  Because that is better than any "You look pretty today" said because he knows you want to hear it.</Content></post><post><Title>I just started following my girlfriend on Spotify</Title><Author>u/BeachPeachMcgee</Author><Content>I confessed to my girlfriend early on in our relationship the genre of music I loved most but was sort of embarrassed by.

Short summarie of our past we knew eachother for 8 weeks and became a couple after 5 weeks. She was really crazy in love with me and let me know about it every day. in our last week we were in a different city together for her job interview and had a lil beef in these 2 days and i said some things you really shouldnt but anyways after that she said she thinks maybe it is better to stop things and break up because she doesnt want to start treating me any different after these events because i deswrve the same treatment as before but she cant give it to me anymore after that weekend.      Soo we broke up on good terms but after 2 weeks of seeing eachother in the club she thought i was telling shit about her and making out with new girls. ofc thats not the case but i think she searched for anything to start hating me and it got so far that after 3-4 weeks after our breakup we ran into eachother  on a open air many times and she ignored me every time on purpose.      I was really hurt and texted her clarifying that i didnt tell any lies or make up with girl ifront of her eyes but she just answered with a dry ‚Äûok, sure we can talk but you act like there is something you can do or change‚Äú after that i didnt respond and our weekly encounters at the clib were just filled with a bad mood and no greetings      Now what do i text her to get her back? we havent seen eachother for 3-4 weeks now and I thoughtvmy first text would be somwthing like:      Hey my brother just told me about this movie we watched on our first date and it made me think of you      Hey it might seem weird now but i just wanted to tell u i miss u and want to try to make things work again, let me know if you eant to talk and feel the same. thanks for everything      So do i send the first message and then as a follow up the second one or do i just send the second one because the first one ist cringe or sum? really look forward for your guys advice      have a lovely day</Content></post><post><Title>I LOVE MY GIRLFRIEND SO FREAKING MUCH!!</Title><Author>u/mokissedyomama</Author><Content>I love this girl so much.

I love listening to him, and he enjoys telling stories, so I laid there with my blanket wrapped around me, listening to him tell me different sweet and happy stories. I felt so comfortable and safe in that moment, like nothing could go wrong. It was such a warm, nice feeling.      I told him this, saying how safe, comfortable, and happy I felt. In response, he started saying such kind things. He told me things like: "You're safe now." "I won't let anything hurt you." and "You can rest now."      I've never been told anything like this before. My whole life, I've been used to abuse and hurt. To hear such simple yet kind sentences as these... shook me to my core. I started crying. Words like that were so foreign. They didn't feel like words I was meant to hear, yet he was telling me them.      He began comforting me as I wept softly, but I was mainly holding back. I've never been good at crying in front of anyone. I made a small, joking comment through the tears like, "I wonder how much I'd cry if I didn't hold back." In response, he told me not to hold back, and to just let myself cry and feel the emotions.      And so I did.      Crying has always been a painful thing for me. When I cry, there's a genuine pain deep in my stomach and it makes me cry out both from the sheer mental pain and from the physical pain. It's like the deep hurt I have bottled up takes physical form.      Yet this crying was... gentle. There was no pain, no crying out. Just... happiness. I've never cried happy tears for anything, but in that moment, with the tears streaming down my face and clouding my eyes, that's all I felt. As I listened to his soothing voice tell me everything was going to be okay and that he wouldn't let anything hurt me, I was genuinely happy.      For almost 2 hours afterward, I sobbed as he told me these kind words.      I think a part of me healed that night. The part that didn't think it would ever be possible for me to be treated with this kind of kindness and love. The part of me who didn't think I deserved any. And all I felt was relief. Relief both at so much built up pain being alleviated that night, and at the fact that I have someone who loves me enough to help me deal with this pain.      It was that night that I realized just how much I really loved him. There's nobody else I'd rather spend the rest of my life with, and I know he's the amazing man I'll marry some day.</Content></post><post><Title>A stranger on a plane told me to never leave my boyfriend and it was one of the most heart warming interactions I‚Äôve ever had with someone I didn‚Äôt know.</Title><Author>u/tahaf</Author><Content>So my boyfriend and I were flying together back home. I, having the bad luck I normally do, was seated in the very back row on a small express plane. My boyfriend was seated very close to the front. We decided that we‚Äôd try to move but if not then it wouldn‚Äôt be a big deal since our flight was a little under 3 hours. I had settled in and so did he so it was safe to assume I‚Äôd be stuck next to an already snoring old man. My boyfriend was seated next to a very sociable New Yorker and they were getting along quite well. Just before take of the man seated next to my boyfriend came walking down the aisle repeating ‚ÄúNumber 14C! Number 14C! It‚Äôs your lucky day, you get to go seat by your man‚Äù  I started to laugh and thanked him then moved up to join my boyfriend. During the majority of the plane ride we listened to music together and I slept on his shoulder. I noticed a few times (especially during landing and the process of exiting the plane) this older woman seated near us staring at us for long periods of time. It kind of got excessive and I was tempted to ask her if she was ok or something... We finally get off the plane and I head towards the closest bathroom. I‚Äôm washing my hands and at the sink right next to me is that same lady. She then tells me ‚Äúyou‚Äôre boyfriend is so sweet to you.. he really is so very sweet to you..‚Äù she had tears in her eyes while she spoke. ‚ÄúI haven‚Äôt seen that kind of love in so long... my husband passed away one year ago today so I just felt like I needed to tell you. I know I don‚Äôt really know you guys but if eyes could speak you two look at each other the same way I did with my husband and we were married over 41 years. He‚Äôs a keeper, don‚Äôt let him go. It‚Äôs hard to find someone who looks at you the way he does and says the things he said to get you to seat next to him on the plane. It was truly beautiful...‚Äù I still have no clue what my boyfriend said to get the guy to switch seats with me but honestly what that woman shared with me made my heart grow 100 times.</Content></post><post><Title>My (23f) bf (25m) unknowingly made two of my dreams come true</Title><Author>u/Fiendfyre831</Author><Content>We were talking in his truck late one night. It was 10:30 pm, pitch black, and raining. When I was about to leave to get into my car I asked if I could give him a hug outside. We hugged. Not some half baked hug. Like the kind that makes you feel like all your broken pieces are finally being glued together. It was also starting to pour but he and I stayed. I then asked if I could kiss him. He pulls back, looks in my eyes and goes in for it. Every time we kiss it feels like fireworks but this time it was more than that. This time one of my dreams came true: to kiss at night in the rain. When I told him this he didn‚Äôt say anything but I could see his smile out of the corner of my eye. Then he picked me up and spun me around. At night. In the rain. Yet another dream come true.

I think it‚Äôs fun to kinda look at a relationship and see all the adorable little gestures that your significant other brings to the table in the relationship. Sometimes we lose sight of those things whether we get comfortable in the relationship, or there are arguments/disagreements ya know.      Me personally there‚Äôs many of them, but a recent one that I find to be so so so so stinking cute, is my bf titled two of his songs after me ü•π. Music is a HUGE part of his life it‚Äôs like his personal little world, and it makes me so happy that he‚Äôs opening it up and sharing a little slice of it with me. Also letting me watch his band play, apparently he didn‚Äôt let his ex of 4 years even see that. He even sang of my favorite songs to me and played guitar along with it, when that‚Äôs not even the genre he‚Äôs super super into. I think that was the sexiest thing I‚Äôve ever gotten to experience. he‚Äôs a sweetie pie.

I tried to work on things for a year, communicating clearly about my thoughts but with little to no changes from him. I still love him, or at least the version of him that existed when we were in a relationship.      My life is so rich outside of romance- I‚Äôm passionate about my hobbies, I have amazing family and friends, I‚Äôm learning new skills, hitting the gym, always trying to better myself. And yet even with all this beauty, I‚Äôm consumed by this dread that I won‚Äôt find the healthy beautiful life long partnership I yearn for. I wanted it so badly with my ex but he just couldn‚Äôt show up for me. I want to stop fixating on this and be consumed by the other beauty in my life instead. How did you stop fixating on finding the one? How have you worked on your acceptance of unfortunate truths?

They are honest, kind, attentive, selfless, selfish is the funniest way, incredibly smart, and they‚Äôre so dedicated to being the best version of themselves.

So all together it‚Äôs been well over a year. This is long because I need to get it off my chest.      How long has the longest time you‚Äôve waited for someone to say it?      I love him so much, with every fiber of my being. We‚Äôve been friends for many, many years and I knew before we were even official. I told him I loved him at official month 6 because I knew he‚Äôs a cautious guy. He told me that he didn‚Äôt feel the same, ‚Äúsame book, different page‚Äù and that it takes him a long time to feel love. It hurt, but I understood. I told him I wouldn‚Äôt say it again until he said it.      Now after so long, I‚Äôm starting to feel incredibly insecure about this. I can‚Äôt tell him how I feel because I know it‚Äôll make him uncomfortable and I want to stick to my word. I will not say it even if I feel like I‚Äôm going to explode. I just whisper it when he‚Äôs asleep and do the sign language I love you when he‚Äôs not looking.      How can he not know yet? We‚Äôve been friends for so long and while we haven‚Äôt been bf/gf for a year, we‚Äôve definitely been together for over that. I feel like I know him, the real him that he shows no one. I have been myself this whole time. He‚Äôs seen me in all my emotions, I‚Äôve shared my deep secrets and fears, he knows me better than anyone. We spend 3/7 days together every week and talk on the phone for hours on the other 4. It‚Äôs not like we‚Äôre not spending enough time together. I know that time changes timelines but that‚Äôs not the case here. So how can he not know?! How come he doesn‚Äôt love me yet? I feel hard to love and like something about me has him unsure. The longer it is, the more insecure I‚Äôm feeling.      I opened up to him about this two nights ago and he said I make him feel secure in the relationship in small and big ways, from the words I say to the actions I take, that he knows exactly how I feel. It‚Äôs breaking my heart that I can‚Äôt say the same. He does tons of things for me and I know without a doubt he cares deeply. He rarely tells me he likes how I look, he never says he cares about me unless I say it first, he never says anything sweet unless I say it first.      I love him with all my heart but I‚Äôm starting to break. How much longer should I wait until I count it as he doesn‚Äôt love me romantically?</Content></post><post><Title>Nothing sexier than a man who only desires you.

At times, I've questioned the authenticity of such feelings, dismissing them as excuses for precipitate decisions. Yet, with you, my skepticism melts away.      In your presence, everything aligns effortlessly, feeling as though you were always destined to be part of my journey, an essential element in the seascape of my life. Your presence fills me with instant familiarity and a profound sense of peace so deep it defies expression. The magnetic pull I feel towards you is unlike anything I have ever experienced; each moment we share only deepens the warmth and certitude that you are the greatest blessing in my life.      Luck was really on my side the day our paths intertwined. As I navigate through my daily routines, I often pause, overwhelmed by gratitude for having you as my partner‚Äîyour tenderness with my heart, your kindness, thoughtfulness, empathy, intellect, and endless intrigue. With you, I can engage in endless conversation, fool around and embrace my inner child, or merely sit in the comforting, homely silence of your presence. The sound of your voice and your laughter reaches into the core of my being, warming me thoroughly. Your respectful treatment of everyone, coupled with your assertive stand for your beliefs, inspires me profoundly.      Our relationship has evolved swiftly, yet every step feels profoundly right. You stand as a luminous exception in a world of ordinary, a stroke of luck in my often luckless life. With each day, as my love for you grows, so too does my fear of ever losing you. But I confront this fear with gratitude, cherishing each moment we share and placing my trust in the strength of our bond.      I'm not one to be very vocal with my emotions until I have decoded my thoughts and have become absolutely certain of my feelings. I think the world of you, I adore you, and my love for you could not be more palpable. Yet, I still find myself at a loss for words, as my feelings for you transcend simple language, manifesting instead in fleeting images and deep emotional stirrings. You awaken parts of me long buried, parts of me not yet discovered, and those I've even forgotten were ever even there. While human language may not yet be equipped to fully capture the essence of my emotions, I am committed to using every tool at my disposal to show you, for all my days, just how immensely you mean to me. You are, without a doubt, profoundly worth every effort.</Content></post><post><Title>I (29m) proposed to my now-fiance (30f) last weekend, and now I keep choking up like a soap opera character at least once a day when talking to her or thinking about her.</Title><Author>u/LaszloKravensworth</Author><Content>No content</Content></post><post><Title>we are on a break and I feel very sad</Title><Author>Unknown author</Author><Content>He has always been my Internet friend; we met about 8 years ago. We dated online for four years while seeing each other twice yearly irl. When he decided to move to my state so we could live together. He was my soul mate, he has always been there for me when no one was. He was the kind of man I liked, a gentleman and a lovely one.      But, some things bothered me, while I've always worked my whole life and saved money, he had nothing. He didn't work. He started studying to apply to the service exam and never passed any. The years passed by and I always requested him to work, he tried, but he didn't stay that long and it never paid him very well. While, his father was giving him money monthly, so he could afford half of our rent and other expenses... he had been depressed all this time and I didn't know how to deal with his "situation". I decided to follow my dream and I studied abroad for 8 months, Both of us got depressed and rly sad because we were apart from each other      I came back to my country to stay with him, even more mature and independent and he was still the same. Hasn't done anything different, and didn't pass the exam again. Well, after two years of my exchange, I told him I wanted a break. And now we're living apart. He moved to another city to pursue his dream of passing this exam and being a diplomatic person and I still have hope he does and we come back together. But this also may not happen.      Every single day I have been crying cause I got too attached to him. I still hope with this job he could give us a better life, although I have everything I need, I wanted him to conquer something... we had to share every single bill bcuz he wouldn't pay anything for me, he said he didn't have enough money.      Still, with so many issues I am emotionally attached to him and I feel I won't ever find a man who had respected and accepted me the way he did.      I am trying to overcome it by going out, trying to meet new people, but we're on break which might be a break up and I still have strong feelings for him so does he...

He was the one who helped me on the same day I lost a family member. He too lost his a year back so when it happened, he was there to help me through it.      We live long distance and ever since I frequently fly to his city every 2 months and we spend time together. The last time it was the death anniversary month of my family member, we both went to a resort trip and had a lot of fun just the two of us.      Whenever we talk to each other, we kind of get dramatic, sad as we both cry sometimes or I cry and it becomes therapeutic. I don't think I've had a connection like this as he is very transparent with me. He tells me about his exes even if I don't ask. He shares why he doesn't want to commit to people and I also share the same sentiments as I don't really commit as well.      We find both of us are happy whenever we are together. He told me he never finds me boring but shared to me that he finds other people boring so he rejected them. He said he's always after the vibes.      We recently had video calls and I realize I can just be 100% myself when with him and he told me the same. He said he's very comfortable when with me. He told me as well that I was special and I meant so much to him.      The thing is he has huge issues with his family and he is isolated in his city. So, i have this huge urge to go to his city. I also am feeling like I need his company such that I feel like i want to go to his city. However, the irony of us not being committed but at the same time having these bond and frequent flying is not lost on me.      Does he seem interested in me or are these just my thoughts?</Content></post><post><Title>What is receiving love in a healthy way like?

I'm still not over it...</Title><Author>u/FtAsNga</Author><Content>Hey lovers and love seekers,      I (33m) can't get over my past experience with a girl (26f) so I thought it might help if I share my story and read some of your comments.      So I met this one girl on a party last year October and we instantly had a good vibe and connected. I promised myself to go slow with her and take time with everything and I did. So we went out on our first three dates in about one month period and slowly came closer, texting almost everyday. On our forth date we went to the movies and that's when our first kiss happened. It was magical and felt great. That's when we also started holding hands and hugging and we really enjoyed each other. Things were going great and we kept texting and meeting like atleast once a week. She was always a little busy with University and work, so I respected that and didn't push at all.      In mid of December she sent me a 3 minute voicemail, telling me that she enjoys everything as it is and that she wants to keep dating me and see where things will go, but that she is not looking for a relationship right now.      My first instinct was like, oh no, damn it, because I really liked her and I'm not the guy for F+ or casual dating and sex. But I tried to play it cool and said it's okay, because at that time there were plenty of girls interested in dating me and I was like ok nvm, let's try and see what will happen.      I then went on a three week vacation in Spain. We kept texting everyday a lot and I couldn't wait to go back and meet up with her again.      So when I came back home on a Sunday, she instantly asked me if we could meet up on Monday at her place. I was happy to see her again and so in the evening I went there and we had a great great time, kissing and cuddling. I felt a little insecure about going to the next step. I knew she wanted it, it was really hot and we both were horny af, but I didn't want to, because I knew the first time would be over so fast, because I stopped touching myself months ago and we wouldn't have much time for round two and three. I didn't know how to tell her, so I left her horny and went home.      The next day I texted her that we should talk and so we talked, and I told Her that going intimate with another person means a lot to me and is not something I do a lot. And I also told her that I have to have strong feelings towards another person before having sex with them. And also that I am more of a relationship guy. Still I couldn't bring up my fear of the first time being over so fast, I just didn't feel comfortable telling her.      We met up again like 5 days later at my place and we both knew it was going to happen. And so it did. We still had a great time that evening, but the sex wasn't good and over very fast, even tho we did go for two rounds.      I didn't feel great after that meeting and so we texted again and I asked her how she felt about that night. She was happy that I asked and she told me she felt like I couldn't let go and that I was a little under tension.      Few days past and we went together with some friends to a party in our city. She was a little distant that day and I decided to give her some free space and I enjoyed the party with my friends. On that party were also other people I knew and one of them, a guy, left with us (we were a group of about 7 people).      While we were walking to a friend's place, she connected with that guy and I didn't intervene, because as stated before, we were not in a relationship. The guy wasn't invited to the friends place and he left. The rest of us went there to relax. She still was very distant and not up for cuddling or anything and I didn't push.      Okay, so after a few days, we still kept texting, she told me she wants to go on a date with that guy from the party and first I didn't say anything. When the date came closer I didn't feel good about it and told her that I don't like her going on a date with someone I know. She was like okay, good to know, but I should have told her earlier and she didn't want to cancel it like one hour before happening. So they went on a date, but it wasn't special or something and yeah.      Few days later I didn't feel good, still felt insecure about our first time and also her wish for dating others and I told her how I feel. Her answer was something like, I'm very busy, many people want to see me, I can only make time like every 2 or 3 weeks.      Receiving this answer I decided to step back and told her that I want to distance myself. She was like, oh okay, I understand and she also doesn't feel good if I'm struggling so much with everything and we Sayed our goodbyes.      And after cutting the connection I instantly felt good again with myself and everything. Few days later she sent me a big text, telling me that she is sad how everything went and that she would like to see me again and to see if we can work things out.      I was happy for her message, because It showed me, that our connection was also meaningful to her and I decided to give it another try and so we talked.      We talked a little, cuddled a lot, she told me how sorry she was about the one message and Blabla.      From then on, everything was goooood. We had a great time together, we saw each other like 4 times in 8 days, had good sex, good time everything perfect.      On the last meeting she told me she has a date planned with a guy from a dating app and I don't know.... It triggered me again. Also the way she was talking about him, like, mhmmmmm, he's a musician and she made a gesture like being horny and wanting to sleep with him and I told her that I can't cope with that.      So we decided that we might try just being friends. So we spent a day together without kissing or anything. It was okay but not the real thing.      One week later she sent me a message, telling me she's late on her period, like 1 or 2 days. I was like, okay. Because 1 or 2 days are quite normal. Just 1 or 2 days later, she was again very distant and told me that she feels left alone that I don't care so much about her maybe being pregnant. She also made an early test which was negative and I don't know.... It's normal that the period can be late up to 6 or 7 days so I didn't really bother much.      I wanted to make up for being disinterested, so we met to talk for like 10 minutes. She was very distant again, and very ugly behaviour towards me and I was angry about that.      Few days later she sent me a message that she got her period. Thanks God.      We had planned that she comes over to my placenon Wednesday so we would cook and eat together, but after everything what happened I didn't feel like it, told her and we cancelled the meeting.      On Friday she sent me WhatsApp, with texts how are you, how was your day, blablabla. I really was not in the mood texting with her and I told her not to text me again because I needed time for myself.      She went very angry, saying it's so childish of me to cancel contact again and blablabla.      We said our goodbyes again.      A week later we saw each other at the same party and didn't even say hello to each other.      I really didn't like how everything went so I texted her, like she texted me before after the first cut, but she was like, no I don't feel it anymore I don't want any contact again.      I accepted it. After almost 2 weeks I still didn't feel good about the situation, so I texted her again and she was like, I thought I made clear I don't want any contact again, I don't feel our connection anymore.      I told her that this was my last try and she won't hear anything from me again.      After that I went through rough 4 weeks, I was very sad and depressed, but I also took my time to process everything and to understand what happened.      We saw each other again on a party 10 days ago. We didn't talk, just one time when she walked besides me she touched my arm but didn't say anything. And also because we both know some same people, once she sat down close to me while I was there with 2 friends and another friend who was with her sat down to me too and she just joined. Not talking to me at all, so I got up and left with the others.      All in all... I'm still not over it 100%. Thinking everyday about what happened and all.      It was a very important experience, I learned a lot about myself and my boundaries. I still miss the time we had, because I never vibed with anyone like that. It's the emptiness which is killing me, after we were so close and shared so much time and memories.      Thank you everybody who made it so far. I think I never wrote a big ass Text like this.

Should I continue?</Title><Author>u/jimmy-grand</Author><Content>I (M39) met this Colombian girl (34) while staying in Medellin one week before i left, but coming back to live there mid May. She also is traveling into Europe the same amount of time i am spending there, but we are in different countries.      We met 4 times that week and talked for hours. On the 3rd date we kissed. After we separated, we texted a lot. She replied back quickly every time, but one moment it took here more than a day, while previously it was just a few hours.      I have an anxious attachment style and worry very quickly and feel stressed about those kind of situations. The next day she told me she was very sick and been in bed all the time.      One week later after 1,5 day still no replies. At that time i am thinking she has someone or doesnt like me anymore, all very unhelpful thoughts. I talked with a friend and she advised to be open about my needs, so i called her and first thing she told me she was super busy finishing projects before leaving to Europe, so makes sense she didnt reply, but i dont like it when she sort of disappears.      I told her about my needs and attachment style and she replied very positively to that, that you should talk about needs in the beginning etc. She also told me she has an avoiding style but that she really wants to change old behaviors. I felt sooo good after this call, talking about my needs and especially since its the first time I am doing that and got really nervous before the call. She also told me that she has this disease where there might me difficulties getting pregnant, so she also showed vulnerability there.      While being in Europe both(im back home with family, she is traveling other countries), she promises to reply on all my texts, (we have like a lot of texts going back and forth over the weeks, so its about 50 now) but over 3 weeks time she didnt reply them at all.      I have been calling her a few times, every time initiative is from my end, but she is always very happy when and enthusiastic when we call. She also still replies to other text quite quickly.      Yesterday i called her after a week i was spending time with my family during a holiday, and we talked about our experiences, but its more like friends and i want to go to a deeper level and to get more insights in how she sees all this. But i don‚Äôt want to be to needy or show some sort of desperate, and im also scared of doing it, scared that she will push me away when im asking for more intimacy.      We will see each other in about 2 weeks again, and somehow want to have this conversation in person, but that might even be harder.      Hope you can give me some good adviceüòá</Content></post><post><Title>Mornings together</Title><Author>u/rooooosa</Author><Content>He is in my bed, snoring away as I type on my computer, sat at the table next to him.

(how to NOT be the woman from baby reindeer)</Title><Author>u/Mediocre-Yam-</Author><Content>I think I have obsessive tendencies and I just despise this part of me. Idk how to stop it but I desperately want to. For context: I only been in love one time before, I remember was how freaking painful and stressful it was to not be able to get someone off your head, to wake up with them in mind and then go to sleep with them in mind. Just the most agonizing feeling ever. Also it‚Äôs filled with anxiety, everything that reminds me of them or reminds me of love shocks my body with a wave of anxiety that is almost painful. It got to an awful point where I became a legit stalker, I don‚Äôt want to go into too much detail because it‚Äôs something I‚Äôm not proud of, not even one bit. But following this person around in circles like a freaking vulture just praying on him. Taking pictures and stuff. Constantly researching trying to get every piece of information about him, via the internet or even stealing his personal stuff. It almost felt like something I HAD to do in order to feel relief, like I couldn‚Äôt stop myself despite how gross I felt about it.  It‚Äôs disgusting behavior and I am so ashamed that this even happened.      That was 5 years ago, the experience was so stressful and made me feel so much disgust for myself I just didn‚Äôt care for looking for a partner I just wanted to live my life in peace with no romance because love is an awful feeling that I cannot control no matter what I do.      But now no clue how it happened again, it‚Äôs so unstoppable, I did not want this to happen at all but it came to me in such a sneaky way I didn‚Äôt even see it approaching until ‚Äúum fuck I‚Äôm actually in love again‚Äù and I hate it so much. It feels just like it did before.      I‚Äôm anxious all the time, it‚Äôs the same body striking anxiety that makes me sweat and shiver and feel as if I was ill. I need to constantly see this person and know what she is doing. Constantly looking her I can‚Äôt stop thinking about her and trying to push me away makes me ache. The difference is I actually know the person this time, and I just can‚Äôt control myself when it comes to texting her and checking on her and just being all over her all the time. Everything she says to me makes me panic, every single word or text needs to be dissected carefully and everything she does means ‚Äúshe hates you‚Äù no matter what, she could be kissing me and all I would feel is she hates me and wants me away and all I want and need is to leach onto her and not let go. Today I had such a scary thought ‚Äú I feel if I had a little screen where I could just watch her go through the day, then I wouldn‚Äôt have to worry and feel better just knowing what she is doing. If I could just monitor her all the time I wouldn‚Äôt feel this pain‚Äù When I thought that I jumped back. I don‚Äôt want to be this way. I started watching the baby reindeer show and when I say the buss stop scene when she just waited every day watching it made me feel sick to my stomach. I don‚Äôt want to be like her even tho I understand how she feels I just hate it so much. I don‚Äôt want to be this how do I stop this?      TLDR: Love feels awful and uncontrollable, I‚Äôm a fucking stalker and I don‚Äôt want to be, how do I make it stop how can I feel normal??</Content></post><post><Title>If you see this I love you</Title><Author>u/SerBrendanhouseSaint</Author><Content>My girlfriend sometimes stalks my reddit when shes at work or bored.

We have been together 'officially' for a very quick seven months but have always had a flirtatiuos relationship with each other from the start. I remember the first time I saw him I thought he was so attractive, everyone else who knew him was so excited to see him so he seemed very friendly and personable. Fast-forward to where we are at now and I could have never imagined my life turning out like it is now. I stay with him about 90% of the time and every time I look at him I want to physically cry from how happy I am. I can't remember the last time I have felt this genuinely happy. I recently went through a bad concussion that affected my blood pressure (weird, I know) and I could barely even walk ten feet without nearly passing out which meant I couldn't work out like I'm use to and that was super hard for me. I spent so much time crying from stress/pain and all that and he never left my side if he didn't have to. He was overly caring and I had never felt so loved in my life. His parents were even calling to check in on me and I had never felt like a partner's parents had cared so much. Everytime I look at my bf I am amazed at how lucky I got to be with him. I love watching him play his video games and seeing him so happy. His laugh is the best sound to me and he always hold me so tightly. I love going with him to run little errands because I love being able to be seen with him in public. He will always give me butterflies and I have never felt my heart so full for someone. I just wanted to tell someone/anyone/everyone about how happy I am because I am so in love and can't wait to marry this man and grow our own little family!</Content></post><post><Title>I witnessed an amazing act of love to share with you</Title><Author>u/ThatTravel5692</Author><Content>I'm a lap swimmer and swim most days at my community Recreation Center. It's the best part of my morning, and I wake up looking forward to it.      The pool has an area for laps, aerobics and walking back &amp;amp; forth and is handicapped accessible via a ramp and a hoist.      One morning I noticed an elderly man pushing a wheel hair with an elderly woman, who was clearly unwell.  The lifeguards gently helped him get her into the pool and into a position where, with her husband's help she could float.      She laid back into his arms with her head against his chest and he slowly pulled her back and forth about the pool, so she could feel the water movement on her body.  She looked so relaxed and happy as she floated in her husband's arms and he had a gentle smile as he looked down at her.      I imagined that she may have loved swimming as much as I do and her husband wanted her to feel the water one last time.      It was one of the greatest acts of love that I have ever witnessed. I pray that I have someone who loves me enough to do the same for me.</Content></post><post><Title>He is sleeping on my lap right now üíï</Title><Author>u/batspersonall</Author><Content>My boyfriend is taking a nap and his head is resting on my lap, every couple of minutes he will shift his head closer to me and squeeze me tigher with his arms hugging my lower back, im stroking my nails through his hair and feeling his little breaths on me is so comfy and nice, i love knowing he is safe and comfortable üíï i love him so much‚ù§</Content></post><post><Title>I wonder where we would be, if we stopped letting our mind talk over our heart...</Title><Author>u/apoetsmind</Author><Content>I think some people just leave a lasting imprint on your soul. The curve of their fingerprints burned into various corners of your mind. It's a different, more permanent, kind of connection. But almost always an inconsistent one. These are the kind of people you always seem to have a place for, a home for them to come back to, even though they'll never call it home. These people always come with a kind of safety. A sense of understanding you don't have with anyone else.      He was one of those people for me.      Always coming and going, like the changing of the seasons. There is no denying the chemistry. Intellectually matched. Equally complicated, broken, with similar but distinctly different baggage. I've never really understood what prompts the intermittent tangling of the invisible red strings. It happens now almost like breathing. He lingers on me like smoke. Like everything I've tried to quite but couldn't.      This time was no different. The invisible red string tugging just under my rib cage prompting me to pick up the phone. I chuckle at his response "I was just getting ready to text you". Who knows how much truth is really in that response but I like to think there is...I like to believe the invisible red string was tugging at him too. His voice will always be calming even when he uses that "I'm trying to impress you with my knowledge" tone (the one I find so incredibly sexy). I dont know how long it's been. TIme doesn't seem to exist for us. Nothing ever seems to change....yet everything is always different.      There it is....right in the middle of ordinary conversation "I'd go anywhere with you." I know he doesn't mean it. None the less my breath catches in my chest and an entire life flashes in small moments in my head. We are standing side by side, laughing that, in some other life we are apart.      I wonder where we would be, if we stopped letting our mind talk over our heart.      Somewhere different, I bet.</Content></post><post><Title>My girlfriend told me that she loved me!!</Title><Author>u/jorik48</Author><Content>I was playing games on the switch with my girlfriend. She told me about a level where she could not get through. She showed me how hard it was and told me that she had asked a lot of friends to help her beat it, but no one could. I wanted to try to beat it for her, but the first time I failed too. Then I tried to switch my approach,  which made me fully focus on the buttons. I only knew I was doing well because of the excitement i heard in my girlfriends voice. I succeeded and my girlfriend was so euphoric that she told me that she loved me.      We never had said this to each other, so she instantly turned red and it looked like she was shocked that it just slipped out. I asked her if she really meant it and she said, yes I do, which made her turn even more red.      I felt totally no doubt at all and I told her I loved her too. We both started smiling at each other and I kissed her. I felt such a warm feeling from inside, I never felt something like it.

My girlfriend and I have been together for a little over 6 months and have known each other for a year. Due to it being her sister's birthday and a holiday the following week, I decided to plan a celebration this weekend.      I made her a little trailer to advertise our anniversary. I used the Black Widow trailer and near the end, it cuts to me with a photo collage of us together and advertising our two-night event.      The first night was okay, the internet made the video quality of our video call grainy and it kept cutting in and out. Even with that, I sent her the mixtape I made her (with songs that we both shared) and she loved it! Okay, moving on to the big event.      Yesterday was our big event and after discussing our relationship and how far we've come, she told me she had a surprise for me at 11:59pm. Woah. I told her I did too (maybe a mistake on my part because she was expecting something, DARN IT!!!) and we danced, watched a movie and played games to pass the time.      So, at 12:01am, after freshening up in the bathroom we got to the bathroom. I got back to the phone and after a little pause, she says "I kinda, sorta, am 100% in love with you." She sent me her beautiful gift and I was happy!      Then, I asked if it was my turn to share with her and she said yes. I prepared a four page speech (which was going to actually be a letter, but I just decided to read it to her). In the letter, it was very personal and heartfelt. I told her I love her.      She, teary-eyed, paused and said..."I love you too."      I cried, we all cried. It was sooooo beautiful.      She then said "I knew since February."      *sobs*      We spent the rest of the night talking about the ways we were planning on saying it. Then we went to sleep at the same time, we didn't hang up and we woke up and continued the conversation.      I will never forget this special moment. Thank you so much, V. I love you so much!      That's it.</Content></post><post><Title>I remember I‚Äôll never be romanced.

Fought for her and married her less than a year later. My life was complete. I was the happiest guy on earth. This lasted for 10 years where I knew we had the kind of bond you see in movies. Nothing could ever tear us apart. It was us against the world.      Then we decided to start a family. Immediately after she gave birth her whole demeanour towards me changed overnight. Gone were the constant moments of affection, the closeness we had on a daily basis, the sex, everything. I put it down to hormonal changes as giving birth is a big ordeal after all, and I gave her time. Lots of time. When after 3 years nothing changed, I sat her down and told her how I felt and how she made me feel. Like I was a stranger in my own house. Like I was living with a room mate who were only acquaintances with no romantic ties, hell without a proper friendship. I was expecting her to say she didn‚Äôt feel the same about me anymore, but to my surprise she said she hadn‚Äôt noticed!! She said she would try harder, and that was that. Nothing changed and we continued our surreal coexistence where nothing made sense to me. I suggested we see a marriage councillor to try and help. At first she agreed, but when d-day arrived she refused to take part.      Fast forward another 3 years and I‚Äôm at my wits end. Unconditional love has turned into resentment. Joyful moments throughout the day where we exchanged a kiss or a touch or even a look has turned into a depressing nightmare for me where I feel utterly rejected and useless as a husband. I feel like the only reason I‚Äôm still needed is when I have to do things for her. Like fix her car, or build her some furniture or run errands. I don‚Äôt get anything in return that makes it feel worthwhile to be married to her anymore.      I don‚Äôt ask for much. All I want is my wife back, to feel wanted and loved. But I‚Äôm getting nothing. At this point the resentment has grown so much that I don‚Äôt think I could trust it even if she magically decided to treat me like she used to. So here I am contemplating ending our marriage. Not because there‚Äôs someone else. I don‚Äôt know if I could ever trust anyone else. All I know is I will be happier on my own because I won‚Äôt be reminded every day of what my life used to be like. The only thing stopping me is our daughter. She is the light of my life and I would rather be unhappy so she doesn‚Äôt have to be. She loves us both equally and she knows something is up because she is forever trying to bring us closer together, even though she‚Äôs only 6.      People say it‚Äôs better for kids if break up with your partner than be in a toxic relationship around them. And I agree. The only thing is we are perfectly pleasant towards one another. We never fight or scream and shout. My wife seems perfectly happy with the current arrangement as she is always on a high. And I would be over the moon for her, but not at my expense and my happiness.      I‚Äôm thinking I should give this a final chance and say to her I‚Äôm about to end it unless she agrees to some councilling, to see if this marriage can be saved. Other than that I don‚Äôt see what other options I have but to walk out of this marriage. Love was always enough for me. It was my only requirement, and without it I have no reason to stay.      If anyone has any insight or went through something similar I would be grateful for a bit of guidance as it scares the shit out of me.</Content></post><post><Title>My boyfriend saves every photo of me and I've never felt so pretty</Title><Author>u/Rvtxyz</Author><Content>As it says, my boyfriend saves every photo of me I send to him. Whether it's a cute mirror photo or of me and my cat, he will save it.      I've always been a little insecure, as everyone has, but I would never ever take a photo of myself. I always looked bad in some way. But I catch him checking me out when I'm doing nothing. Whether I'm standing around, or get up for the washroom, his eyes are on me. At first, I imagined it was because the relationship was fresh, but over a year later, he still does it like he always has. Even when he is deep in his games, he will take a moment to appreciate me. He makes my insecurities dissappear :)</Content></post><post><Title>Sometimes in breakups, people tend to look back and start missing the good times and feel a sense of regret. If this is you, Stop.

I tried going on dates, but it feels more like a job that something I want to do.      I don‚Äôt like going through people as in a catalogue. I want to meet someone organically. I really want to. I‚Äôve never fallen in love and I deeply want to, but I don‚Äôt want to put any effort into ‚Äúfinding‚Äù someone.      Do you think I‚Äôm missing out?

I‚Äôve been having some bad anxiety about some other stuff and this got to me so bad I had to go sit outside of our apartment for the next 20 minutes until my partner got home (they were already on their way). Once they got home they went and tossed our whole room for almost an hour just to try to find the spider and then later on when I said I couldn‚Äôt sleep in our room because I was still too freaked they said they wanted to sleep in the living room with me and even went in to our room and got my pjs and some blankets and shook them out to make sure they were spider free. I feel so lucky to have someone in my life who loves me so much and happily spends so much time and energy protecting me even if it‚Äôs just from something that‚Äôs smaller than my stupid thumb, and who never treats me like I‚Äôm foolish.

I, having the bad luck I normally do, was seated in the very back row on a small express plane. My boyfriend was seated very close to the front. We decided that we‚Äôd try to move but if not then it wouldn‚Äôt be a big deal since our flight was a little under 3 hours. I had settled in and so did he so it was safe to assume I‚Äôd be stuck next to an already snoring old man. My boyfriend was seated next to a very sociable New Yorker and they were getting along quite well. Just before take of the man seated next to my boyfriend came walking down the aisle repeating ‚ÄúNumber 14C! Number 14C! It‚Äôs your lucky day, you get to go seat by your man‚Äù  I started to laugh and thanked him then moved up to join my boyfriend. During the majority of the plane ride we listened to music together and I slept on his shoulder. I noticed a few times (especially during landing and the process of exiting the plane) this older woman seated near us staring at us for long periods of time. It kind of got excessive and I was tempted to ask her if she was ok or something... We finally get off the plane and I head towards the closest bathroom. I‚Äôm washing my hands and at the sink right next to me is that same lady. She then tells me ‚Äúyou‚Äôre boyfriend is so sweet to you.. he really is so very sweet to you..‚Äù she had tears in her eyes while she spoke. ‚ÄúI haven‚Äôt seen that kind of love in so long... my husband passed away one year ago today so I just felt like I needed to tell you. I know I don‚Äôt really know you guys but if eyes could speak you two look at each other the same way I did with my husband and we were married over 41 years. He‚Äôs a keeper, don‚Äôt let him go. It‚Äôs hard to find someone who looks at you the way he does and says the things he said to get you to seat next to him on the plane. It was truly beautiful...‚Äù I still have no clue what my boyfriend said to get the guy to switch seats with me but honestly what that woman shared with me made my heart grow 100 times.</Content></post><post><Title>I love him ü•∫</Title><Author>u/manicpixie123</Author><Content>Ok I just have to gush.

He‚Äôs just getting his finances together so we can try and get married by next year (fingers crossed). So usually when we talk about the future we know it includes us as a married couple.      Last night over the phone I was telling him that once I‚Äôm properly making money (I‚Äôm still in the process of getting licensed as a lawyer) that I would like to gift my dad some flying lessons, because that‚Äôs always been a dream of his. In response, my boyfriend said ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs awesome, that definitely seems like something we could do for him‚Äù.      I know some people might not think much of it, but the fact that he included himself in this and said it was something ‚Äúwe‚Äù could do for my dad just makes my heart melt. He‚Äôs the sweetest man I‚Äôve ever met. I really don‚Äôt know what I did to deserve him.</Content></post><post><Title>I am the happiest I've ever been because of my boyfriend!</Title><Author>u/Knuckles-the-ech1dna</Author><Content>I (25f) have known my boyfriend (32m) since January of this year. We have been together 'officially' for a very quick seven months but have always had a flirtatiuos relationship with each other from the start. I remember the first time I saw him I thought he was so attractive, everyone else who knew him was so excited to see him so he seemed very friendly and personable. Fast-forward to where we are at now and I could have never imagined my life turning out like it is now. I stay with him about 90% of the time and every time I look at him I want to physically cry from how happy I am. I can't remember the last time I have felt this genuinely happy. I recently went through a bad concussion that affected my blood pressure (weird, I know) and I could barely even walk ten feet without nearly passing out which meant I couldn't work out like I'm use to and that was super hard for me. I spent so much time crying from stress/pain and all that and he never left my side if he didn't have to. He was overly caring and I had never felt so loved in my life. His parents were even calling to check in on me and I had never felt like a partner's parents had cared so much. Everytime I look at my bf I am amazed at how lucky I got to be with him. I love watching him play his video games and seeing him so happy. His laugh is the best sound to me and he always hold me so tightly. I love going with him to run little errands because I love being able to be seen with him in public. He will always give me butterflies and I have never felt my heart so full for someone. I just wanted to tell someone/anyone/everyone about how happy I am because I am so in love and can't wait to marry this man and grow our own little family!</Content></post><post><Title>He is sleeping on my lap right now üíï</Title><Author>u/batspersonall</Author><Content>My boyfriend is taking a nap and his head is resting on my lap, every couple of minutes he will shift his head closer to me and squeeze me tigher with his arms hugging my lower back, im stroking my nails through his hair and feeling his little breaths on me is so comfy and nice, i love knowing he is safe and comfortable üíï i love him so much‚ù§</Content></post><post><Title>My girlfriend told me that she loved me!!</Title><Author>u/jorik48</Author><Content>I was playing games on the switch with my girlfriend. She told me about a level where she could not get through. She showed me how hard it was and told me that she had asked a lot of friends to help her beat it, but no one could. I wanted to try to beat it for her, but the first time I failed too. Then I tried to switch my approach,  which made me fully focus on the buttons. I only knew I was doing well because of the excitement i heard in my girlfriends voice. I succeeded and my girlfriend was so euphoric that she told me that she loved me.      We never had said this to each other, so she instantly turned red and it looked like she was shocked that it just slipped out. I asked her if she really meant it and she said, yes I do, which made her turn even more red.      I felt totally no doubt at all and I told her I loved her too. We both started smiling at each other and I kissed her. I felt such a warm feeling from inside, I never felt something like it.      It is really an amazing feeling to know that you love someone, but the feeling that someone else loves you is just the best!!!</Content></post><post><Title>True love</Title><Author>u/TheImmortalDude</Author><Content>No content</Content></post><post><Title>IT HAPPENED, WE FINALLY SAID I LOVE YOU!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</Title><Author>Unknown author</Author><Content>Ahhhhhhhhh      So it finally happened. My girlfriend and I have been together for a little over 6 months and have known each other for a year. Due to it being her sister's birthday and a holiday the following week, I decided to plan a celebration this weekend.      I made her a little trailer to advertise our anniversary. I used the Black Widow trailer and near the end, it cuts to me with a photo collage of us together and advertising our two-night event.      The first night was okay, the internet made the video quality of our video call grainy and it kept cutting in and out. Even with that, I sent her the mixtape I made her (with songs that we both shared) and she loved it! Okay, moving on to the big event.      Yesterday was our big event and after discussing our relationship and how far we've come, she told me she had a surprise for me at 11:59pm. Woah. I told her I did too (maybe a mistake on my part because she was expecting something, DARN IT!!!) and we danced, watched a movie and played games to pass the time.      So, at 12:01am, after freshening up in the bathroom we got to the bathroom. I got back to the phone and after a little pause, she says "I kinda, sorta, am 100% in love with you." She sent me her beautiful gift and I was happy!      Then, I asked if it was my turn to share with her and she said yes. I prepared a four page speech (which was going to actually be a letter, but I just decided to read it to her). In the letter, it was very personal and heartfelt. I told her I love her.      She, teary-eyed, paused and said..."I love you too."      I cried, we all cried. It was sooooo beautiful.      She then said "I knew since February."      *sobs*      We spent the rest of the night talking about the ways we were planning on saying it. Then we went to sleep at the same time, we didn't hang up and we woke up and continued the conversation.      I will never forget this special moment. Thank you so much, V. I love you so much!      That's it.</Content></post><post><Title>I got a video of the way my boyfriend looks at me</Title><Author>u/fixationed</Author><Content>I brought my camera with me to a restaurant we went to.

At first she agreed, but when d-day arrived she refused to take part.      Fast forward another 3 years and I‚Äôm at my wits end. Unconditional love has turned into resentment. Joyful moments throughout the day where we exchanged a kiss or a touch or even a look has turned into a depressing nightmare for me where I feel utterly rejected and useless as a husband. I feel like the only reason I‚Äôm still needed is when I have to do things for her. Like fix her car, or build her some furniture or run errands. I don‚Äôt get anything in return that makes it feel worthwhile to be married to her anymore.      I don‚Äôt ask for much. All I want is my wife back, to feel wanted and loved. But I‚Äôm getting nothing. At this point the resentment has grown so much that I don‚Äôt think I could trust it even if she magically decided to treat me like she used to. So here I am contemplating ending our marriage. Not because there‚Äôs someone else. I don‚Äôt know if I could ever trust anyone else. All I know is I will be happier on my own because I won‚Äôt be reminded every day of what my life used to be like. The only thing stopping me is our daughter. She is the light of my life and I would rather be unhappy so she doesn‚Äôt have to be. She loves us both equally and she knows something is up because she is forever trying to bring us closer together, even though she‚Äôs only 6.      People say it‚Äôs better for kids if break up with your partner than be in a toxic relationship around them. And I agree. The only thing is we are perfectly pleasant towards one another. We never fight or scream and shout. My wife seems perfectly happy with the current arrangement as she is always on a high. And I would be over the moon for her, but not at my expense and my happiness.      I‚Äôm thinking I should give this a final chance and say to her I‚Äôm about to end it unless she agrees to some councilling, to see if this marriage can be saved. Other than that I don‚Äôt see what other options I have but to walk out of this marriage. Love was always enough for me. It was my only requirement, and without it I have no reason to stay.      If anyone has any insight or went through something similar I would be grateful for a bit of guidance as it scares the shit out of me.</Content></post><post><Title>My boyfriend saves every photo of me and I've never felt so pretty</Title><Author>u/Rvtxyz</Author><Content>As it says, my boyfriend saves every photo of me I send to him. Whether it's a cute mirror photo or of me and my cat, he will save it.      I've always been a little insecure, as everyone has, but I would never ever take a photo of myself. I always looked bad in some way. But I catch him checking me out when I'm doing nothing. Whether I'm standing around, or get up for the washroom, his eyes are on me. At first, I imagined it was because the relationship was fresh, but over a year later, he still does it like he always has. Even when he is deep in his games, he will take a moment to appreciate me. He makes my insecurities dissappear :)</Content></post><post><Title>Sometimes in breakups, people tend to look back and start missing the good times and feel a sense of regret. If this is you, Stop.

I‚Äôve been having some bad anxiety about some other stuff and this got to me so bad I had to go sit outside of our apartment for the next 20 minutes until my partner got home (they were already on their way). Once they got home they went and tossed our whole room for almost an hour just to try to find the spider and then later on when I said I couldn‚Äôt sleep in our room because I was still too freaked they said they wanted to sleep in the living room with me and even went in to our room and got my pjs and some blankets and shook them out to make sure they were spider free. I feel so lucky to have someone in my life who loves me so much and happily spends so much time and energy protecting me even if it‚Äôs just from something that‚Äôs smaller than my stupid thumb, and who never treats me like I‚Äôm foolish.

I, having the bad luck I normally do, was seated in the very back row on a small express plane. My boyfriend was seated very close to the front. We decided that we‚Äôd try to move but if not then it wouldn‚Äôt be a big deal since our flight was a little under 3 hours. I had settled in and so did he so it was safe to assume I‚Äôd be stuck next to an already snoring old man. My boyfriend was seated next to a very sociable New Yorker and they were getting along quite well. Just before take of the man seated next to my boyfriend came walking down the aisle repeating ‚ÄúNumber 14C! Number 14C! It‚Äôs your lucky day, you get to go seat by your man‚Äù  I started to laugh and thanked him then moved up to join my boyfriend. During the majority of the plane ride we listened to music together and I slept on his shoulder. I noticed a few times (especially during landing and the process of exiting the plane) this older woman seated near us staring at us for long periods of time. It kind of got excessive and I was tempted to ask her if she was ok or something... We finally get off the plane and I head towards the closest bathroom. I‚Äôm washing my hands and at the sink right next to me is that same lady. She then tells me ‚Äúyou‚Äôre boyfriend is so sweet to you.. he really is so very sweet to you..‚Äù she had tears in her eyes while she spoke. ‚ÄúI haven‚Äôt seen that kind of love in so long... my husband passed away one year ago today so I just felt like I needed to tell you. I know I don‚Äôt really know you guys but if eyes could speak you two look at each other the same way I did with my husband and we were married over 41 years. He‚Äôs a keeper, don‚Äôt let him go. It‚Äôs hard to find someone who looks at you the way he does and says the things he said to get you to seat next to him on the plane. It was truly beautiful...‚Äù I still have no clue what my boyfriend said to get the guy to switch seats with me but honestly what that woman shared with me made my heart grow 100 times.</Content></post><post><Title>I love him ü•∫</Title><Author>u/manicpixie123</Author><Content>Ok I just have to gush.

In response, my boyfriend said ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs awesome, that definitely seems like something we could do for him‚Äù.      I know some people might not think much of it, but the fact that he included himself in this and said it was something ‚Äúwe‚Äù could do for my dad just makes my heart melt.

We have been together 'officially' for a very quick seven months but have always had a flirtatiuos relationship with each other from the start. I remember the first time I saw him I thought he was so attractive, everyone else who knew him was so excited to see him so he seemed very friendly and personable. Fast-forward to where we are at now and I could have never imagined my life turning out like it is now. I stay with him about 90% of the time and every time I look at him I want to physically cry from how happy I am. I can't remember the last time I have felt this genuinely happy. I recently went through a bad concussion that affected my blood pressure (weird, I know) and I could barely even walk ten feet without nearly passing out which meant I couldn't work out like I'm use to and that was super hard for me. I spent so much time crying from stress/pain and all that and he never left my side if he didn't have to. He was overly caring and I had never felt so loved in my life. His parents were even calling to check in on me and I had never felt like a partner's parents had cared so much. Everytime I look at my bf I am amazed at how lucky I got to be with him. I love watching him play his video games and seeing him so happy. His laugh is the best sound to me and he always hold me so tightly. I love going with him to run little errands because I love being able to be seen with him in public. He will always give me butterflies and I have never felt my heart so full for someone. I just wanted to tell someone/anyone/everyone about how happy I am because I am so in love and can't wait to marry this man and grow our own little family!</Content></post><post><Title>Devastated with a guy's toxicity. Why does he get a kick when i get anxious for his safety?</Title><Author>u/Dazzling_Ant_6881</Author><Content>I decided to ghost a guy friend because he became too much for me. I find that he is so self-destructive he can bring me down with him if I get too close.      For context, I got really mad at him because he got into an accident which caused him to break some bones and I only learned it when he messaged me that he traveled to God knows where. I was extremely in high anxiety when he delivered the news and I was asking where he was, was he with someone. Well, he never told me where he was. He only explained he did drive because he wants to learn how to. I told him he should have known he is not good at it and why do it.      Previous to this, we have been emotionally dependent to each other for 3 months where he would always act as like my doctor when im sick and he always takes care of me. But, i can never forget the times when he lied to me, told me that he was living with a room mate who was abusive when in fact it was his partner. I only knew about it through a mutual friend of ours. He is not transparent at all with me and I'm suppose to be close to him and all.  Whenever we talk in the past, he always makes sure to go out of his house because he said someone might hear.      I clearly remembered a time in the past when he also said he feared for his life with an abusive ex and also dragged me in the situation by texting me and asking me for help. By the way, he still stayed with the ex for sometime and i think they are still together and could be the reason why he broke his bone.      It feels like he gets a kick when he puts me in a high anxiety mode for his safety so dropping him is the best option at this point.      I told him i dont know what to say when he delivered the news. I got tired because it did not feel like it was a friendship anymore. I felt like i was a mistress of some sort.</Content></post><post><Title>He is sleeping on my lap right now üíï</Title><Author>u/batspersonall</Author><Content>My boyfriend is taking a nap and his head is resting on my lap, every couple of minutes he will shift his head closer to me and squeeze me tigher with his arms hugging my lower back, im stroking my nails through his hair and feeling his little breaths on me is so comfy and nice, i love knowing he is safe and comfortable üíï i love him so much‚ù§</Content></post><post><Title>Love languages can make relationships worse as opposed to better</Title><Author>u/JoneseyP98</Author><Content>I believe love languages and people's focus on them can actually make relationships worse.      I am a self confessed love bomber. I shower my partner with love, which for an autistic man, I think he deals with remarkably well. But, I have absolutely pulled back and I also can read his signals when he is not comfortable.  This can be from giving him some space, to giving him a kiss on his cheek not a kiss on the lips and a cuddle.  Other times, he wants a cuddle of his own accord, BUT it comes from him.      My love language would be to receive more compliments/words of love. But that isn't him. So I don't demand them.      His way of showing love is the way he looks after me. The way he looks at me sometimes. And when he does tell me he loves me or that I look gorgeous, I know he means it and it isn't coming from a place of duty, knowing it what I want versus what he wants to say.      I feel adored. And it isn't about love languages. It is the way he shows me this is his own way.      So what I'm saying is look for the ways your partner shows you naturally what he thinks of you. How he shows he loves you.  Because that is better than any "You look pretty today" said because he knows you want to hear it.</Content></post><post><Title>My girlfriend told me that she loved me!!</Title><Author>u/jorik48</Author><Content>I was playing games on the switch with my girlfriend. She told me about a level where she could not get through. She showed me how hard it was and told me that she had asked a lot of friends to help her beat it, but no one could. I wanted to try to beat it for her, but the first time I failed too. Then I tried to switch my approach,  which made me fully focus on the buttons. I only knew I was doing well because of the excitement i heard in my girlfriends voice. I succeeded and my girlfriend was so euphoric that she told me that she loved me.      We never had said this to each other, so she instantly turned red and it looked like she was shocked that it just slipped out. I asked her if she really meant it and she said, yes I do, which made her turn even more red.      I felt totally no doubt at all and I told her I loved her too. We both started smiling at each other and I kissed her. I felt such a warm feeling from inside, I never felt something like it.

Short summarie of our past we knew eachother for 8 weeks and became a couple after 5 weeks. She was really crazy in love with me and let me know about it every day. in our last week we were in a different city together for her job interview and had a lil beef in these 2 days and i said some things you really shouldnt but anyways after that she said she thinks maybe it is better to stop things and break up because she doesnt want to start treating me any different after these events because i deswrve the same treatment as before but she cant give it to me anymore after that weekend.      Soo we broke up on good terms but after 2 weeks of seeing eachother in the club she thought i was telling shit about her and making out with new girls. ofc thats not the case but i think she searched for anything to start hating me and it got so far that after 3-4 weeks after our breakup we ran into eachother  on a open air many times and she ignored me every time on purpose.      I was really hurt and texted her clarifying that i didnt tell any lies or make up with girl ifront of her eyes but she just answered with a dry ‚Äûok, sure we can talk but you act like there is something you can do or change‚Äú after that i didnt respond and our weekly encounters at the clib were just filled with a bad mood and no greetings      Now what do i text her to get her back? we havent seen eachother for 3-4 weeks now and I thoughtvmy first text would be somwthing like:      Hey my brother just told me about this movie we watched on our first date and it made me think of you      Hey it might seem weird now but i just wanted to tell u i miss u and want to try to make things work again, let me know if you eant to talk and feel the same. thanks for everything      So do i send the first message and then as a follow up the second one or do i just send the second one because the first one ist cringe or sum? really look forward for your guys advice      have a lovely day</Content></post><post><Title>True love</Title><Author>u/TheImmortalDude</Author><Content>No content</Content></post><post><Title>Parents, what does it mean to love your own child vs not love them?</Title><Author>u/Own-Possession6683</Author><Content>I‚Äôm a first time mom to a 7 month old little boy, I do everything I‚Äôm supposed to do provide for him.

My girlfriend and I have been together for a little over 6 months and have known each other for a year. Due to it being her sister's birthday and a holiday the following week, I decided to plan a celebration this weekend.      I made her a little trailer to advertise our anniversary. I used the Black Widow trailer and near the end, it cuts to me with a photo collage of us together and advertising our two-night event.      The first night was okay, the internet made the video quality of our video call grainy and it kept cutting in and out. Even with that, I sent her the mixtape I made her (with songs that we both shared) and she loved it! Okay, moving on to the big event.      Yesterday was our big event and after discussing our relationship and how far we've come, she told me she had a surprise for me at 11:59pm. Woah. I told her I did too (maybe a mistake on my part because she was expecting something, DARN IT!!!) and we danced, watched a movie and played games to pass the time.      So, at 12:01am, after freshening up in the bathroom we got to the bathroom. I got back to the phone and after a little pause, she says "I kinda, sorta, am 100% in love with you." She sent me her beautiful gift and I was happy!      Then, I asked if it was my turn to share with her and she said yes. I prepared a four page speech (which was going to actually be a letter, but I just decided to read it to her). In the letter, it was very personal and heartfelt. I told her I love her.      She, teary-eyed, paused and said..."I love you too."      I cried, we all cried. It was sooooo beautiful.      She then said "I knew since February."      *sobs*      We spent the rest of the night talking about the ways we were planning on saying it. Then we went to sleep at the same time, we didn't hang up and we woke up and continued the conversation.      I will never forget this special moment. Thank you so much, V. I love you so much!

He pulls back, looks in my eyes and goes in for it. Every time we kiss it feels like fireworks but this time it was more than that. This time one of my dreams came true: to kiss at night in the rain. When I told him this he didn‚Äôt say anything but I could see his smile out of the corner of my eye. Then he picked me up and spun me around. At night. In the rain. Yet another dream come true.

I think it‚Äôs fun to kinda look at a relationship and see all the adorable little gestures that your significant other brings to the table in the relationship. Sometimes we lose sight of those things whether we get comfortable in the relationship, or there are arguments/disagreements ya know.      Me personally there‚Äôs many of them, but a recent one that I find to be so so so so stinking cute, is my bf titled two of his songs after me ü•π. Music is a HUGE part of his life it‚Äôs like his personal little world, and it makes me so happy that he‚Äôs opening it up and sharing a little slice of it with me. Also letting me watch his band play, apparently he didn‚Äôt let his ex of 4 years even see that. He even sang of my favorite songs to me and played guitar along with it, when that‚Äôs not even the genre he‚Äôs super super into.

I tried to work on things for a year, communicating clearly about my thoughts but with little to no changes from him. I still love him, or at least the version of him that existed when we were in a relationship.      My life is so rich outside of romance- I‚Äôm passionate about my hobbies, I have amazing family and friends, I‚Äôm learning new skills, hitting the gym, always trying to better myself. And yet even with all this beauty, I‚Äôm consumed by this dread that I won‚Äôt find the healthy beautiful life long partnership I yearn for. I wanted it so badly with my ex but he just couldn‚Äôt show up for me. I want to stop fixating on this and be consumed by the other beauty in my life instead.

So all together it‚Äôs been well over a year. This is long because I need to get it off my chest.      How long has the longest time you‚Äôve waited for someone to say it?      I love him so much, with every fiber of my being. We‚Äôve been friends for many, many years and I knew before we were even official. I told him I loved him at official month 6 because I knew he‚Äôs a cautious guy. He told me that he didn‚Äôt feel the same, ‚Äúsame book, different page‚Äù and that it takes him a long time to feel love. It hurt, but I understood. I told him I wouldn‚Äôt say it again until he said it.      Now after so long, I‚Äôm starting to feel incredibly insecure about this. I can‚Äôt tell him how I feel because I know it‚Äôll make him uncomfortable and I want to stick to my word. I will not say it even if I feel like I‚Äôm going to explode. I just whisper it when he‚Äôs asleep and do the sign language I love you when he‚Äôs not looking.      How can he not know yet? We‚Äôve been friends for so long and while we haven‚Äôt been bf/gf for a year, we‚Äôve definitely been together for over that. I feel like I know him, the real him that he shows no one. I have been myself this whole time. He‚Äôs seen me in all my emotions, I‚Äôve shared my deep secrets and fears, he knows me better than anyone. We spend 3/7 days together every week and talk on the phone for hours on the other 4. It‚Äôs not like we‚Äôre not spending enough time together. I know that time changes timelines but that‚Äôs not the case here. So how can he not know?! How come he doesn‚Äôt love me yet? I feel hard to love and like something about me has him unsure. The longer it is, the more insecure I‚Äôm feeling.      I opened up to him about this two nights ago and he said I make him feel secure in the relationship in small and big ways, from the words I say to the actions I take, that he knows exactly how I feel. It‚Äôs breaking my heart that I can‚Äôt say the same. He does tons of things for me and I know without a doubt he cares deeply. He rarely tells me he likes how I look, he never says he cares about me unless I say it first, he never says anything sweet unless I say it first.      I love him with all my heart but I‚Äôm starting to break. How much longer should I wait until I count it as he doesn‚Äôt love me romantically?</Content></post><post><Title>My girlfriend texted me this after an amazing night together.

At times, I've questioned the authenticity of such feelings, dismissing them as excuses for precipitate decisions. Yet, with you, my skepticism melts away.      In your presence, everything aligns effortlessly, feeling as though you were always destined to be part of my journey, an essential element in the seascape of my life. Your presence fills me with instant familiarity and a profound sense of peace so deep it defies expression. The magnetic pull I feel towards you is unlike anything I have ever experienced; each moment we share only deepens the warmth and certitude that you are the greatest blessing in my life.      Luck was really on my side the day our paths intertwined. As I navigate through my daily routines, I often pause, overwhelmed by gratitude for having you as my partner‚Äîyour tenderness with my heart, your kindness, thoughtfulness, empathy, intellect, and endless intrigue. With you, I can engage in endless conversation, fool around and embrace my inner child, or merely sit in the comforting, homely silence of your presence. The sound of your voice and your laughter reaches into the core of my being, warming me thoroughly. Your respectful treatment of everyone, coupled with your assertive stand for your beliefs, inspires me profoundly.      Our relationship has evolved swiftly, yet every step feels profoundly right. You stand as a luminous exception in a world of ordinary, a stroke of luck in my often luckless life. With each day, as my love for you grows, so too does my fear of ever losing you. But I confront this fear with gratitude, cherishing each moment we share and placing my trust in the strength of our bond.      I'm not one to be very vocal with my emotions until I have decoded my thoughts and have become absolutely certain of my feelings. I think the world of you, I adore you, and my love for you could not be more palpable. Yet, I still find myself at a loss for words, as my feelings for you transcend simple language, manifesting instead in fleeting images and deep emotional stirrings. You awaken parts of me long buried, parts of me not yet discovered, and those I've even forgotten were ever even there. While human language may not yet be equipped to fully capture the essence of my emotions, I am committed to using every tool at my disposal to show you, for all my days, just how immensely you mean to me. You are, without a doubt, profoundly worth every effort.</Content></post><post><Title>Yesterday my boyfriend kissed my tears while I was breaking down</Title><Author>u/Specialist_Jump7987</Author><Content>Yesterday I was having a breakdown in bed, because birth control is messing my hormones so bad, while my boyfriend was hugging me and trying to let me know I was safe and I could cry with him.

We dated online for four years while seeing each other twice yearly irl. When he decided to move to my state so we could live together. He was my soul mate, he has always been there for me when no one was. He was the kind of man I liked, a gentleman and a lovely one.      But, some things bothered me, while I've always worked my whole life and saved money, he had nothing. He didn't work. He started studying to apply to the service exam and never passed any. The years passed by and I always requested him to work, he tried, but he didn't stay that long and it never paid him very well. While, his father was giving him money monthly, so he could afford half of our rent and other expenses... he had been depressed all this time and I didn't know how to deal with his "situation". I decided to follow my dream and I studied abroad for 8 months, Both of us got depressed and rly sad because we were apart from each other      I came back to my country to stay with him, even more mature and independent and he was still the same. Hasn't done anything different, and didn't pass the exam again. Well, after two years of my exchange, I told him I wanted a break. And now we're living apart. He moved to another city to pursue his dream of passing this exam and being a diplomatic person and I still have hope he does and we come back together. But this also may not happen.      Every single day I have been crying cause I got too attached to him. I still hope with this job he could give us a better life, although I have everything I need, I wanted him to conquer something... we had to share every single bill bcuz he wouldn't pay anything for me, he said he didn't have enough money.      Still, with so many issues I am emotionally attached to him and I feel I won't ever find a man who had respected and accepted me the way he did.      I am trying to overcome it by going out, trying to meet new people, but we're on break which might be a break up and I still have strong feelings for him so does he...      Please, what's your advice about my situation?</Content></post><post><Title>My gf has trouble sleeping so I read bedtime stories to her</Title><Author>u/yungcoco777</Author><Content>M20 F19.

I don't know that we're even anything to each other, except that we like each other's company. Recently I noticed that when he makes a stupid joke (trust me they are always really bad) and I laugh, it's like a light goes on inside his face. Like sunshine in his eyes. He tries to hold it back sometimes but the goofy smile always peeks through. It makes him so happy just that he made me laugh. And realizing that makes my heart feel like melting butter.

Fought for her and married her less than a year later. My life was complete. I was the happiest guy on earth. This lasted for 10 years where I knew we had the kind of bond you see in movies. Nothing could ever tear us apart. It was us against the world.      Then we decided to start a family. Immediately after she gave birth her whole demeanour towards me changed overnight. Gone were the constant moments of affection, the closeness we had on a daily basis, the sex, everything. I put it down to hormonal changes as giving birth is a big ordeal after all, and I gave her time. Lots of time. When after 3 years nothing changed, I sat her down and told her how I felt and how she made me feel. Like I was a stranger in my own house. Like I was living with a room mate who were only acquaintances with no romantic ties, hell without a proper friendship. I was expecting her to say she didn‚Äôt feel the same about me anymore, but to my surprise she said she hadn‚Äôt noticed!! She said she would try harder, and that was that. Nothing changed and we continued our surreal coexistence where nothing made sense to me. I suggested we see a marriage councillor to try and help. At first she agreed, but when d-day arrived she refused to take part.      Fast forward another 3 years and I‚Äôm at my wits end. Unconditional love has turned into resentment. Joyful moments throughout the day where we exchanged a kiss or a touch or even a look has turned into a depressing nightmare for me where I feel utterly rejected and useless as a husband. I feel like the only reason I‚Äôm still needed is when I have to do things for her. Like fix her car, or build her some furniture or run errands. I don‚Äôt get anything in return that makes it feel worthwhile to be married to her anymore.      I don‚Äôt ask for much. All I want is my wife back, to feel wanted and loved. But I‚Äôm getting nothing. At this point the resentment has grown so much that I don‚Äôt think I could trust it even if she magically decided to treat me like she used to. So here I am contemplating ending our marriage. Not because there‚Äôs someone else. I don‚Äôt know if I could ever trust anyone else. All I know is I will be happier on my own because I won‚Äôt be reminded every day of what my life used to be like. The only thing stopping me is our daughter. She is the light of my life and I would rather be unhappy so she doesn‚Äôt have to be. She loves us both equally and she knows something is up because she is forever trying to bring us closer together, even though she‚Äôs only 6.      People say it‚Äôs better for kids if break up with your partner than be in a toxic relationship around them. And I agree. The only thing is we are perfectly pleasant towards one another. We never fight or scream and shout. My wife seems perfectly happy with the current arrangement as she is always on a high. And I would be over the moon for her, but not at my expense and my happiness.      I‚Äôm thinking I should give this a final chance and say to her I‚Äôm about to end it unless she agrees to some councilling, to see if this marriage can be saved. Other than that I don‚Äôt see what other options I have but to walk out of this marriage. Love was always enough for me. It was my only requirement, and without it I have no reason to stay.      If anyone has any insight or went through something similar I would be grateful for a bit of guidance as it scares the shit out of me.</Content></post><post><Title>Why is the guy opening up emotionally to me when he is an avoidant?</Title><Author>u/ThrowRAventzzz</Author><Content>A guy friend and I have shared trauma of losing a family member. He was the one who helped me on the same day I lost a family member. He too lost his a year back so when it happened, he was there to help me through it.      We live long distance and ever since I frequently fly to his city every 2 months and we spend time together. The last time it was the death anniversary month of my family member, we both went to a resort trip and had a lot of fun just the two of us.      Whenever we talk to each other, we kind of get dramatic, sad as we both cry sometimes or I cry and it becomes therapeutic. I don't think I've had a connection like this as he is very transparent with me. He tells me about his exes even if I don't ask. He shares why he doesn't want to commit to people and I also share the same sentiments as I don't really commit as well.      We find both of us are happy whenever we are together. He told me he never finds me boring but shared to me that he finds other people boring so he rejected them. He said he's always after the vibes.      We recently had video calls and I realize I can just be 100% myself when with him and he told me the same. He said he's very comfortable when with me. He told me as well that I was special and I meant so much to him.      The thing is he has huge issues with his family and he is isolated in his city. So, i have this huge urge to go to his city. I also am feeling like I need his company such that I feel like i want to go to his city. However, the irony of us not being committed but at the same time having these bond and frequent flying is not lost on me.      Does he seem interested in me or are these just my thoughts?</Content></post><post><Title>My boyfriend saves every photo of me and I've never felt so pretty</Title><Author>u/Rvtxyz</Author><Content>As it says, my boyfriend saves every photo of me I send to him. Whether it's a cute mirror photo or of me and my cat, he will save it.      I've always been a little insecure, as everyone has, but I would never ever take a photo of myself. I always looked bad in some way. But I catch him checking me out when I'm doing nothing. Whether I'm standing around, or get up for the washroom, his eyes are on me. At first, I imagined it was because the relationship was fresh, but over a year later, he still does it like he always has. Even when he is deep in his games, he will take a moment to appreciate me. He makes my insecurities dissappear :)</Content></post><post><Title>Fell in Love and screwd up big time. I'm still not over it...</Title><Author>u/FtAsNga</Author><Content>Hey lovers and love seekers,      I (33m) can't get over my past experience with a girl (26f) so I thought it might help if I share my story and read some of your comments.      So I met this one girl on a party last year October and we instantly had a good vibe and connected. I promised myself to go slow with her and take time with everything and I did. So we went out on our first three dates in about one month period and slowly came closer, texting almost everyday. On our forth date we went to the movies and that's when our first kiss happened. It was magical and felt great. That's when we also started holding hands and hugging and we really enjoyed each other. Things were going great and we kept texting and meeting like atleast once a week. She was always a little busy with University and work, so I respected that and didn't push at all.      In mid of December she sent me a 3 minute voicemail, telling me that she enjoys everything as it is and that she wants to keep dating me and see where things will go, but that she is not looking for a relationship right now.      My first instinct was like, oh no, damn it, because I really liked her and I'm not the guy for F+ or casual dating and sex. But I tried to play it cool and said it's okay, because at that time there were plenty of girls interested in dating me and I was like ok nvm, let's try and see what will happen.      I then went on a three week vacation in Spain. We kept texting everyday a lot and I couldn't wait to go back and meet up with her again.      So when I came back home on a Sunday, she instantly asked me if we could meet up on Monday at her place. I was happy to see her again and so in the evening I went there and we had a great great time, kissing and cuddling. I felt a little insecure about going to the next step. I knew she wanted it, it was really hot and we both were horny af, but I didn't want to, because I knew the first time would be over so fast, because I stopped touching myself months ago and we wouldn't have much time for round two and three. I didn't know how to tell her, so I left her horny and went home.      The next day I texted her that we should talk and so we talked, and I told Her that going intimate with another person means a lot to me and is not something I do a lot. And I also told her that I have to have strong feelings towards another person before having sex with them. And also that I am more of a relationship guy. Still I couldn't bring up my fear of the first time being over so fast, I just didn't feel comfortable telling her.      We met up again like 5 days later at my place and we both knew it was going to happen. And so it did. We still had a great time that evening, but the sex wasn't good and over very fast, even tho we did go for two rounds.      I didn't feel great after that meeting and so we texted again and I asked her how she felt about that night. She was happy that I asked and she told me she felt like I couldn't let go and that I was a little under tension.      Few days past and we went together with some friends to a party in our city. She was a little distant that day and I decided to give her some free space and I enjoyed the party with my friends. On that party were also other people I knew and one of them, a guy, left with us (we were a group of about 7 people).      While we were walking to a friend's place, she connected with that guy and I didn't intervene, because as stated before, we were not in a relationship. The guy wasn't invited to the friends place and he left. The rest of us went there to relax. She still was very distant and not up for cuddling or anything and I didn't push.      Okay, so after a few days, we still kept texting, she told me she wants to go on a date with that guy from the party and first I didn't say anything. When the date came closer I didn't feel good about it and told her that I don't like her going on a date with someone I know. She was like okay, good to know, but I should have told her earlier and she didn't want to cancel it like one hour before happening. So they went on a date, but it wasn't special or something and yeah.      Few days later I didn't feel good, still felt insecure about our first time and also her wish for dating others and I told her how I feel. Her answer was something like, I'm very busy, many people want to see me, I can only make time like every 2 or 3 weeks.      Receiving this answer I decided to step back and told her that I want to distance myself. She was like, oh okay, I understand and she also doesn't feel good if I'm struggling so much with everything and we Sayed our goodbyes.      And after cutting the connection I instantly felt good again with myself and everything. Few days later she sent me a big text, telling me that she is sad how everything went and that she would like to see me again and to see if we can work things out.      I was happy for her message, because It showed me, that our connection was also meaningful to her and I decided to give it another try and so we talked.      We talked a little, cuddled a lot, she told me how sorry she was about the one message and Blabla.      From then on, everything was goooood. We had a great time together, we saw each other like 4 times in 8 days, had good sex, good time everything perfect.      On the last meeting she told me she has a date planned with a guy from a dating app and I don't know.... It triggered me again. Also the way she was talking about him, like, mhmmmmm, he's a musician and she made a gesture like being horny and wanting to sleep with him and I told her that I can't cope with that.      So we decided that we might try just being friends. So we spent a day together without kissing or anything. It was okay but not the real thing.      One week later she sent me a message, telling me she's late on her period, like 1 or 2 days. I was like, okay. Because 1 or 2 days are quite normal. Just 1 or 2 days later, she was again very distant and told me that she feels left alone that I don't care so much about her maybe being pregnant. She also made an early test which was negative and I don't know.... It's normal that the period can be late up to 6 or 7 days so I didn't really bother much.      I wanted to make up for being disinterested, so we met to talk for like 10 minutes. She was very distant again, and very ugly behaviour towards me and I was angry about that.      Few days later she sent me a message that she got her period. Thanks God.      We had planned that she comes over to my placenon Wednesday so we would cook and eat together, but after everything what happened I didn't feel like it, told her and we cancelled the meeting.      On Friday she sent me WhatsApp, with texts how are you, how was your day, blablabla. I really was not in the mood texting with her and I told her not to text me again because I needed time for myself.      She went very angry, saying it's so childish of me to cancel contact again and blablabla.      We said our goodbyes again.      A week later we saw each other at the same party and didn't even say hello to each other.      I really didn't like how everything went so I texted her, like she texted me before after the first cut, but she was like, no I don't feel it anymore I don't want any contact again.      I accepted it. After almost 2 weeks I still didn't feel good about the situation, so I texted her again and she was like, I thought I made clear I don't want any contact again, I don't feel our connection anymore.      I told her that this was my last try and she won't hear anything from me again.      After that I went through rough 4 weeks, I was very sad and depressed, but I also took my time to process everything and to understand what happened.      We saw each other again on a party 10 days ago. We didn't talk, just one time when she walked besides me she touched my arm but didn't say anything. And also because we both know some same people, once she sat down close to me while I was there with 2 friends and another friend who was with her sat down to me too and she just joined. Not talking to me at all, so I got up and left with the others.      All in all... I'm still not over it 100%. Thinking everyday about what happened and all.      It was a very important experience, I learned a lot about myself and my boundaries. I still miss the time we had, because I never vibed with anyone like that. It's the emptiness which is killing me, after we were so close and shared so much time and memories.      Thank you everybody who made it so far. I think I never wrote a big ass Text like this.

Should I continue?</Title><Author>u/jimmy-grand</Author><Content>I (M39) met this Colombian girl (34) while staying in Medellin one week before i left, but coming back to live there mid May. She also is traveling into Europe the same amount of time i am spending there, but we are in different countries.      We met 4 times that week and talked for hours. On the 3rd date we kissed. After we separated, we texted a lot. She replied back quickly every time, but one moment it took here more than a day, while previously it was just a few hours.      I have an anxious attachment style and worry very quickly and feel stressed about those kind of situations. The next day she told me she was very sick and been in bed all the time.      One week later after 1,5 day still no replies. At that time i am thinking she has someone or doesnt like me anymore, all very unhelpful thoughts. I talked with a friend and she advised to be open about my needs, so i called her and first thing she told me she was super busy finishing projects before leaving to Europe, so makes sense she didnt reply, but i dont like it when she sort of disappears.      I told her about my needs and attachment style and she replied very positively to that, that you should talk about needs in the beginning etc. She also told me she has an avoiding style but that she really wants to change old behaviors. I felt sooo good after this call, talking about my needs and especially since its the first time I am doing that and got really nervous before the call. She also told me that she has this disease where there might me difficulties getting pregnant, so she also showed vulnerability there.      While being in Europe both(im back home with family, she is traveling other countries), she promises to reply on all my texts, (we have like a lot of texts going back and forth over the weeks, so its about 50 now) but over 3 weeks time she didnt reply them at all.      I have been calling her a few times, every time initiative is from my end, but she is always very happy when and enthusiastic when we call. She also still replies to other text quite quickly.      Yesterday i called her after a week i was spending time with my family during a holiday, and we talked about our experiences, but its more like friends and i want to go to a deeper level and to get more insights in how she sees all this. But i don‚Äôt want to be to needy or show some sort of desperate, and im also scared of doing it, scared that she will push me away when im asking for more intimacy.      We will see each other in about 2 weeks again, and somehow want to have this conversation in person, but that might even be harder.      Hope you can give me some good adviceüòá</Content></post><post><Title>I refuse to find love through a dating app. Am I wrong?</Title><Author>u/AideZealousideal5809</Author><Content>I (23F) really don‚Äôt like the idea of having to chase love. All this ‚Äúput yourself out there‚Äù ‚Äúgo on dates‚Äù I just don‚Äôt want to do it. Just the idea seems exhausting. And it‚Äôs not like I‚Äôm completely socially inept. I tried going on dates, but it feels more like a job that something I want to do.      I don‚Äôt like going through people as in a catalogue. I want to meet someone organically. I really want to. I‚Äôve never fallen in love and I deeply want to, but I don‚Äôt want to put any effort into ‚Äúfinding‚Äù someone.      Do you think I‚Äôm missing out? How do you feel about searching for love instead of finding it?</Content></post><post><Title>How to control obsession? (how to NOT be the woman from baby reindeer)</Title><Author>u/Mediocre-Yam-</Author><Content>I think I have obsessive tendencies and I just despise this part of me. Idk how to stop it but I desperately want to. For context: I only been in love one time before, I remember was how freaking painful and stressful it was to not be able to get someone off your head, to wake up with them in mind and then go to sleep with them in mind. Just the most agonizing feeling ever. Also it‚Äôs filled with anxiety, everything that reminds me of them or reminds me of love shocks my body with a wave of anxiety that is almost painful. It got to an awful point where I became a legit stalker, I don‚Äôt want to go into too much detail because it‚Äôs something I‚Äôm not proud of, not even one bit. But following this person around in circles like a freaking vulture just praying on him. Taking pictures and stuff. Constantly researching trying to get every piece of information about him, via the internet or even stealing his personal stuff. It almost felt like something I HAD to do in order to feel relief, like I couldn‚Äôt stop myself despite how gross I felt about it.  It‚Äôs disgusting behavior and I am so ashamed that this even happened.      That was 5 years ago, the experience was so stressful and made me feel so much disgust for myself I just didn‚Äôt care for looking for a partner I just wanted to live my life in peace with no romance because love is an awful feeling that I cannot control no matter what I do.      But now no clue how it happened again, it‚Äôs so unstoppable, I did not want this to happen at all but it came to me in such a sneaky way I didn‚Äôt even see it approaching until ‚Äúum fuck I‚Äôm actually in love again‚Äù and I hate it so much. It feels just like it did before.      I‚Äôm anxious all the time, it‚Äôs the same body striking anxiety that makes me sweat and shiver and feel as if I was ill. I need to constantly see this person and know what she is doing. Constantly looking her I can‚Äôt stop thinking about her and trying to push me away makes me ache. The difference is I actually know the person this time, and I just can‚Äôt control myself when it comes to texting her and checking on her and just being all over her all the time. Everything she says to me makes me panic, every single word or text needs to be dissected carefully and everything she does means ‚Äúshe hates you‚Äù no matter what, she could be kissing me and all I would feel is she hates me and wants me away and all I want and need is to leach onto her and not let go. Today I had such a scary thought ‚Äú I feel if I had a little screen where I could just watch her go through the day, then I wouldn‚Äôt have to worry and feel better just knowing what she is doing. If I could just monitor her all the time I wouldn‚Äôt feel this pain‚Äù When I thought that I jumped back. I don‚Äôt want to be this way. I started watching the baby reindeer show and when I say the buss stop scene when she just waited every day watching it made me feel sick to my stomach. I don‚Äôt want to be like her even tho I understand how she feels I just hate it so much. I don‚Äôt want to be this how do I stop this?      TLDR: Love feels awful and uncontrollable, I‚Äôm a fucking stalker and I don‚Äôt want to be, how do I make it stop how can I feel normal??</Content></post><post><Title>My partner slept in the living room with me</Title><Author>u/glow_worm_22</Author><Content>So I have severe arachnophobia, like ridiculously bad, and today while home alone saw a quarter sized spider in our room that managed to scurry off into a pile of clothes. I‚Äôve been having some bad anxiety about some other stuff and this got to me so bad I had to go sit outside of our apartment for the next 20 minutes until my partner got home (they were already on their way). Once they got home they went and tossed our whole room for almost an hour just to try to find the spider and then later on when I said I couldn‚Äôt sleep in our room because I was still too freaked they said they wanted to sleep in the living room with me and even went in to our room and got my pjs and some blankets and shook them out to make sure they were spider free. I feel so lucky to have someone in my life who loves me so much and happily spends so much time and energy protecting me even if it‚Äôs just from something that‚Äôs smaller than my stupid thumb, and who never treats me like I‚Äôm foolish. Not a day goes by when I‚Äôm not thankful that we found each other and I‚Äôm so lucky to get to love someone like them!!!</Content></post><post><Title>i love her so much i want to give her the world</Title><Author>u/thughunter_com</Author><Content>here is the paragraph i sent her      you mean everything to me bae i love you forever you make feel like myself i can be safe when im with you i admire your love your hair your voice your laugh your smile your eyes your personality i admire everything about you are the girl in my dreams that i always wanted to be with i wanna have a future with you a future where i can call you my wife i wanna grow old with you i wanna be buried next to you i wanna spend every single day of my life with you and every single minute of my life with you.i can always tell you how i feel when something happens to me you have always been my number one supporter and always my number one priority i want to give you everything you ever wanted i love you so so so much i love you amor i will be with you forever and ever you make my heart beat your the only why i still breathe baby come fall away with me i love you</Content></post><post><Title>"Wanna do a collab?"</Title><Author>Unknown author</Author><Content>This beautiful boyo saw me doodling and asked, "Wanna do a collab?"

It's the best part of my morning, and I wake up looking forward to it.      The pool has an area for laps, aerobics and walking back &amp;amp; forth and is handicapped accessible via a ramp and a hoist.      One morning I noticed an elderly man pushing a wheel hair with an elderly woman, who was clearly unwell.  The lifeguards gently helped him get her into the pool and into a position where, with her husband's help she could float.      She laid back into his arms with her head against his chest and he slowly pulled her back and forth about the pool, so she could feel the water movement on her body.  She looked so relaxed and happy as she floated in her husband's arms and he had a gentle smile as he looked down at her.      I imagined that she may have loved swimming as much as I do and her husband wanted her to feel the water one last time.      It was one of the greatest acts of love that I have ever witnessed. I pray that I have someone who loves me enough to do the same for me.</Content></post><post><Title>my boyfriend proposes every day</Title><Author>u/Virtual_Foot_9402</Author><Content>my boyfriend proposes to me every single day and i know he‚Äôs not like completely serious but he does mean it. like if i were to say yeah let‚Äôs go now he‚Äôd be so happy. it‚Äôs so cute and feels so good to know he wants to be with me forever and isn‚Äôt afraid of showing it. &amp;lt;3</Content></post><post><Title>I wonder where we would be, if we stopped letting our mind talk over our heart...</Title><Author>u/apoetsmind</Author><Content>I think some people just leave a lasting imprint on your soul. The curve of their fingerprints burned into various corners of your mind. It's a different, more permanent, kind of connection. But almost always an inconsistent one. These are the kind of people you always seem to have a place for, a home for them to come back to, even though they'll never call it home. These people always come with a kind of safety. A sense of understanding you don't have with anyone else.      He was one of those people for me.      Always coming and going, like the changing of the seasons. There is no denying the chemistry. Intellectually matched. Equally complicated, broken, with similar but distinctly different baggage. I've never really understood what prompts the intermittent tangling of the invisible red strings. It happens now almost like breathing. He lingers on me like smoke. Like everything I've tried to quite but couldn't.      This time was no different. The invisible red string tugging just under my rib cage prompting me to pick up the phone. I chuckle at his response "I was just getting ready to text you". Who knows how much truth is really in that response but I like to think there is...I like to believe the invisible red string was tugging at him too. His voice will always be calming even when he uses that "I'm trying to impress you with my knowledge" tone (the one I find so incredibly sexy). I dont know how long it's been. TIme doesn't seem to exist for us. Nothing ever seems to change....yet everything is always different.      There it is....right in the middle of ordinary conversation "I'd go anywhere with you." I know he doesn't mean it. None the less my breath catches in my chest and an entire life flashes in small moments in my head. We are standing side by side, laughing that, in some other life we are apart.      I wonder where we would be, if we stopped letting our mind talk over our heart.      Somewhere different, I bet.</Content></post><post><Title>A stranger on a plane told me to never leave my boyfriend and it was one of the most heart warming interactions I‚Äôve ever had with someone I didn‚Äôt know.</Title><Author>u/tahaf</Author><Content>So my boyfriend and I were flying together back home. I, having the bad luck I normally do, was seated in the very back row on a small express plane. My boyfriend was seated very close to the front. We decided that we‚Äôd try to move but if not then it wouldn‚Äôt be a big deal since our flight was a little under 3 hours. I had settled in and so did he so it was safe to assume I‚Äôd be stuck next to an already snoring old man. My boyfriend was seated next to a very sociable New Yorker and they were getting along quite well. Just before take of the man seated next to my boyfriend came walking down the aisle repeating ‚ÄúNumber 14C! Number 14C! It‚Äôs your lucky day, you get to go seat by your man‚Äù  I started to laugh and thanked him then moved up to join my boyfriend. During the majority of the plane ride we listened to music together and I slept on his shoulder. I noticed a few times (especially during landing and the process of exiting the plane) this older woman seated near us staring at us for long periods of time. It kind of got excessive and I was tempted to ask her if she was ok or something... We finally get off the plane and I head towards the closest bathroom. I‚Äôm washing my hands and at the sink right next to me is that same lady. She then tells me ‚Äúyou‚Äôre boyfriend is so sweet to you.. he really is so very sweet to you..‚Äù she had tears in her eyes while she spoke. ‚ÄúI haven‚Äôt seen that kind of love in so long... my husband passed away one year ago today so I just felt like I needed to tell you. I know I don‚Äôt really know you guys but if eyes could speak you two look at each other the same way I did with my husband and we were married over 41 years. He‚Äôs a keeper, don‚Äôt let him go. It‚Äôs hard to find someone who looks at you the way he does and says the things he said to get you to seat next to him on the plane. It was truly beautiful...‚Äù I still have no clue what my boyfriend said to get the guy to switch seats with me but honestly what that woman shared with me made my heart grow 100 times.</Content></post><post><Title>I just had a woman approach me for the first time ever.</Title><Author>u/daxforsnax</Author><Content>I really blew it, but it still made me feel incredible.      The other day my sister invited me to join her and her friends for drinks. I almost never go out to do anything, but I've recently been trying to work on my confidence and generally try to improve myself, so I gladly accepted this opportunity.      While at the bar, a woman one table over had been looking my way (unbeknownst to me. I was told so by the girls I was with)      Later their group joined our table, and she sat herself next to me and started asking me questions and gave me some compliments. She even said I looked like Jason Momoa. And me being me, I just blushed and struggled to even respond üòë      She eventually lost interest, and the night continued as usual.

What makes you look at a couple and go "they're so right for each other"? If you've been in a long-term loving and happy relationship, what did that look like?      One thing I know is that relationships based on friendship rather than sexual attraction have better odds (oxytocin). What else?      I've been thinking of telling my best friend I'd like to be in a relationship with her, but I would rather we stay friends than be together for a few months. If we get together I want it to last, I want it to be worth it.</Content></post><post><Title>he's a dream</Title><Author>u/lmarigold01</Author><Content>i feel like i'm living a movie. my bf (19) texted me out of the blue to get dressed quickly because he's coming to pick me up. i kept asking him where he's taking me but he refused to tell me (that smug arrogant son of a bitch). we were in the car for a while (maybe like 4 hours or something) and fleetwood mac was softly playing in the background and he intertwined his fingers with mine and i couldn't control it but i just stared at him asking myself how i got so lucky and then i saw the corners of his mouth move up and he smiled softly and asked what I was doing and if i liked what i saw. i was like hell yes. and he laughed and i swear his laugh is the sweetest sound on the planet. in the universe. i could die happy knowing ive heard his sweet laugh a million times. he's so good to me. after the 4 hours, i noticed we're at this national park and i'm wearing a flowy summery dress and I asked him why we were going hiking because i'm obviously not dressed for it and he said just be patient and you'll see and the next thing you know he's carrying a picnic basket and a blanket from the trunk of his car and we're walking towards this meadow of flowers and greens and tall oak trees. and i smiled so big and he goes "do you like it" and seemed nervous (which he never should feel because just being in his presence makes me feel so happy) and i didn't answer and kissed him deeply and i could feel us both smiling into the kiss and fastforward a lil bit and i'm laying my head in his lap and he's playing with my hair and I go "this is the most content ive ever felt in my life" and he goes "me too" and i think i straight about died because im so in love with him. :(</Content></post><post><Title>I remember I‚Äôll never be romanced.

In response, my boyfriend said ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs awesome, that definitely seems like something we could do for him‚Äù.      I know some people might not think much of it, but the fact that he included himself in this and said it was something ‚Äúwe‚Äù could do for my dad just makes my heart melt.
