  giveaway with the permission of the mod team. The prize is: one 16TB IronWolf Pro
  Hard Disk Drive How to enter: Just reply to this post once with a top-level comment
  response on the following topic: What kind of loyalty program matters to you for
  a company? Is drive capacity, price point, excellent customer service, etc. the
  highest priority for you? Please include the phrases RunWithIronWolf and Seagate
  in your comment. Selection process/rules One entry per person. Using alt accounts
  will result in a ban. New accounts created after this post went live are not eligible.

  utility to filter out top level comments (that is, top-level replies to this post,
  and not to another comment, and not on any cross-posts). The tool will remove duplicate

  the winner will be contacted within a day or so of the giveaway ending. Winners
  will have 48 hrs to get us their physical address and contact details for shipping
  (no PO boxes). Any person who does not reply in time loses their spot and everyone

Content: After just having a drive failure (of course it happened while transferring
  data to a new drive) I was wondering if there was any tooling around that perhaps
  data recovery folks leveraged to help diagnose issues. I've got two drives right
  now (8TB Seagate Archive drives) that died suddenly. One seems like it could be
  a bad logic board and I do have another with not just the same general board but
  the same batch? (same qr code) but haven't transferred the ROM between the boards
  to see if that will address it. The other (the one that died today while trying
  to transfer data to a new drive) will spin up but then makes a sound like the heads
  are seeking twice and then spins down. As I understand that's likely a hardware
  problem and not as home fixable. While the data one these drives aren't critical
  it would be nice to be able to better diagnose the problems to see if it is worth
  the hassle to try to recover them.

Content: Currently rocking a QNAP TVS-h874 with 2x WD Red Pro 24 TB mirrored as RAIDZ1.
  As I work on developing a robust backup strategy for my NAS, I wonder if QNAP offers
  a native solution that allows splitting backups across multiple external drives
  automatically, without manually dividing my directories into chunks of 4 TB each.
  The rationale is that a 24 TB backup cannot fit on a single 4 TB external HDD. This
  becomes even more apparent if I expand to a usable 144 TB in the future. In that
  case, it would be impossible to find a single 144 TB external drive, as such drives
  simply do not exist. So, is it possible to distribute backups across multiple external
  drives using QuTS hero 5? How exactly?

Content: Building my first DIY NAS. Need 2+2 tb to start off with. Trying to be as
  cheap as possible. Will be storing all memories and irreplaceable things. Will get
  an external HDD for offsite backup. Also, I do not care about read write speeds.
  I just want my data to be safe and backed up at the end of the day for as cheap
  as possible, I will add new data maybe once a month if not even more rarely. I will
  be using my old motherboard (6 SATA ports) and processor. Will get a new 500 GB
  ssd for OS and new RAM. Now here is the dilemma. I am from India and WD Purples
  are selling for 5250 INR each, cheapest. Next up, WD Blue is also selling for 6000+
  INR. I can technically afford (but want to avoid at all costs) to get a 10TB UltraStar
  or EXOS for 22000 INR but I need two physical drives at least and my total storage
  need for backup right now or even 3 years later will not exceed 4-5TB. so a 10TB
  HDD will be useless, not to mention spending 45K INR on drives only (which is VERY
  VERY EXPENSIVE FOR ME). I know WD Purple glosses over write errors and can be bad.
  Chucking is equally expensive, if not more. Should I just get 2x 2tb WD Purple for
  10.5K INR and set up my backup server for now. Will add more HDDs later as needed
  (1-4 years later). Can I do anything to prevent the write errors? Also, if there
  is a cheaper way, especially in the long run, I would appreciate it. Currently I
  have ~2TB data which grows by like 200-400GB a year. I have thought of BluRay drives
  but I am unable to procure new BluRay drives cheap enough.

  everything I have in a motley collection of drives. Impressively they came WITH
  both a pin3 disabled power cable AND a card with a little kapton tape and instructions.
  As I am using a Sabrent 5-bay (eBay find, decent price for a non-raid external)
  I used the tape to disable the pin3 reset. Discovered I need to cut back on the
  caffeine as my hands were shaking WAAAY to much to make that easy. But it is up

  two more go raid 5. Now to spend some of the weekend using an external SATA dock

Content: Hello all! I have been hunting for the right location to ask my many, many
  questions. This may not be technical enough for this subreddit, but it seemed like
  the right place to go. I'm a big fan of physical media, likely casual to most here
  but to my friends I am perceived as intensely pro-physical media. As such, whenever
  people have spare tapes, CDs, DVDs, etc etc, I'm the man they throw them at. Unfortunately,
  I am horribly unfamiliar with the digitization process for everything except for
  CDs and DVDs, and even then I occasionally have hiccups. Recently I purchased the
  JVC RC-EZ38S CD Portable System (link to user manual) from a flea market to play
  some of my tapes and CDs, and realized I had a few tapes I'm unable to find anywhere
  online. Usually I wouldn't worry about my tapes growing old from wear because I
  can download songs and save them that way, but these tapes (mostly Halloween tracks)
  were impossible for me to find elsewhere, so I've been trying to preserve them.
  The JVC product I purchased plays CDs, cassette tapes, and the radio. It has one
  single 3.5mm jack, a headphone output. I have done some googling, and found my best
  bet to save the audio is through a combination of cables and Audacity. Unfortunately,
  my computer only recognizes my aux cord as headphones, and I cannot treat my JVC
  product as a microphone when using Audacity. I have two cables - one aux with two
  3.5mm ends, and one cable that has a male 3.5mm on one end and the other end has
  two male parts, white and yellow RCA jacks. How, if at all, can I use my JVC player
  to preserve the tapes I have? Is there a special cord combination I may be able
  to put together that won't put me out of house and home (I'm unemployed and in a
  somewhat difficult spot financially, even a $20 purchase has me aghast sometimes)
  or would I be better off looking for a different product to record my tapes? A friend
  of mine is currently looking to rehome an old car radio with cassette player - Do
  those typically have RCA plugs, and would that be a way to go about this? Anything
  helps, even just correcting my terms so I can communicate what I'm looking for a
  little better - I'm in a space where I truly don't know what it is that I don't
  know. I'd love to be a part of saving some lost media, even if it seems a little
  silly. People put work into those Halloween tapes, dammit!

  from various websites... Send or comment links of videos you need downloaded. Currently
  going through POV livestreams/replays. NOTE: livestreams/POV are of the utmost importance.
  AKA Twitch/dlive/Facebook Live, etc. If you find any of these POV angles, please
  tag me directly in your comment, or PM me. These generally get taken down VERY fast
  by the livestream website. UPDATE: Thank you to everyone who shared links (and continue
  to do so). I am noticing that a lot of the content is now duplicates, or variations
  (crops, lower quality, etc) of the same content. So I have put all the content I
  have on MEGA. If I have replied to your comment then the content for sure is in
  this torrent. MEGA: https://mega.nz/folder/30MlkQib#RDOaGzmtFEHkxSYBaJSzVA (this
  is the prefered way of downloading) (This is sitting in at ~350GB as of Jan 10 3:00
  PM EST. Still adding content) UPDATE 2: Link should be working - MEGA contacted
  me and reinstated the account (and gave premium so I could upload more). I will
  be uploading more content that I find to the mega account. Still going through the
  comments, and the 900+ messages I have. Keep posting comments and I will upload
  them to the MEGA folder. UPDATE 3: "Bellingcat" has created a really efficient way

Content: I know many people on here already recommended SPD as a source for fair priced
  disks. I just wanted to add my $.02 after a recent experience with a failed drive
  I'd purchased a few months ago. A week ago I woke up to a TrueNas notification that
  a drive was faulted. I did some troubleshooting and wasn't able to recover any kind
  of connection to the drive. Plugging it in to a external adapter resulted in what
  sounded like a rock tumbler, so clearly it was beyond rescue. I started a RMA with
  SPD, and went back to work; expecting a few hours delay before hearing anything
  back. Later I realized I'd missed their almost immediate reply to the RMA request.
  I explained there was no way provide smart test results, and attached a video of
  my new rock tumbler. In short order the RMA# was provided. I shipped the faulted
  drive, and didn't think much of it. The drive was delivered yesterday and my replacement
  shipped this morning. Long story short, big kudos to ServerPartDeals for what is
  unprecedented customer service in the modern world; and to all the unsure shoppers,

  is a data preservation effort for just the articles, and does not help Sci-Hub directly.  Sci-Hub
  is not in any further imminent danger than it always has been, and is not at greater
  risk of being shut-down than before. A Rescue Mission for Sci-Hub and Open Science
  Elsevier and the USDOJ have declared war against Sci-Hub and open science. The era
  of Sci-Hub and Alexandra standing alone in this fight must end. We have to take
  a stand with her. On May 7th, Sci-Hub''s Alexandra Elbakyan revealed that the FBI
  has been wiretapping her accounts for over 2 years. This news comes after Twitter
  silenced the official Sci_Hub twitter account because Indian academics were organizing
  on it against Elsevier. Sci-Hub itself is currently frozen and has not downloaded
  any new articles since December 2020. This rescue mission is focused on seeding
  the article collection in order to prepare for a potential Sci-Hub shutdown. Alexandra
  Elbakyan of Sci-Hub, bookwarrior of Library Genesis , Aaron Swartz , and countless
  unnamed others have fought to free science from the grips of for-profit publishers.
  Today, they do it working in hiding, alone, without acknowledgment, in fear of imprisonment,
  and even now wiretapped by the FBI. They sacrifice everything for one vision: Open
  Science. Why do they do it? They do it so that humble scholars on the other side
  of the planet can practice medicine, create science, fight for democracy, teach,
  and learn. People like Alexandra Elbakyan would give up their personal freedom for
  that one goal: to free knowledge. For that, Elsevier Corp (RELX, market cap: 50
  billion) wants to silence her, wants to see her in prison, and wants to shut Sci-Hub
  down. It''s time we sent Elsevier and the USDOJ a clearer message about the fate
  of Sci-Hub and open science: we are the library, we do not get silenced, we do not
  shut down our computers, and we are many. Rescue Mission for Sci-Hub If you have
  been following the story, then you know that this is not our first rescue mission.
  We protected the Library Genesis book collection We unlocked over 5,000 COVID-19
  research articles We successfully petitioned publishers to unlock their COVID-19
  paywalls bookwarrior, the founder of Library Genesis, took his library onto the
  de-centralized and un-censorable IPFS web Next? Make Sci-Hub un-censorable too.
  Rescue Target A handful of Library Genesis seeders are currently seeding the Sci-Hub
  torrents. There are 850 scihub torrents , each containing 100,000 scientific articles,
  to a total of 85 million scientific articles: 77TB. This is the complete Sci-Hub
  database. We need to protect this. Rescue Team Wave 1: We need 85 datahoarders to
  store and seed 1TB of articles each, 10 torrents in total. Download 10 random torrents
  from the scimag index of < 12 seeders , then load the torrents onto your client
  and seed for as long as you can. The articles are coded by DOI and in zip files.
  Wave 2: Reach out to 10 good friends to ask them to grab just 1 random torrent (100GB).
  That''s 850 seeders. We are now the library. Final Wave: Development for an open
  source Sci-Hub. freereadorg/awesome-libgen is a collection of open source achievements
  based on the Sci-Hub and Library Genesis databases. Open source de-centralization
  of Sci-Hub is the ultimate goal here, and this begins with the data, but it is going

Content: Hello all! I have been hunting for the right location to ask my many, many
  questions. This may not be technical enough for this subreddit, but it seemed like
  the right place to go. I'm a big fan of physical media, likely casual to most here
  but to my friends I am perceived as intensely pro-physical media. As such, whenever
  people have spare tapes, CDs, DVDs, etc etc, I'm the man they throw them at. Unfortunately,
  I am horribly unfamiliar with the digitization process for everything except for
  CDs and DVDs, and even then I occasionally have hiccups. Recently I purchased the
  JVC RC-EZ38S CD Portable System (link to user manual) from a flea market to play
  some of my tapes and CDs, and realized I had a few tapes I'm unable to find anywhere
  online. Usually I wouldn't worry about my tapes growing old from wear because I
  can download songs and save them that way, but these tapes (mostly Halloween tracks)
  were impossible for me to find elsewhere, so I've been trying to preserve them.
  The JVC product I purchased plays CDs, cassette tapes, and the radio. It has one
  single 3.5mm jack, a headphone output. I have done some googling, and found my best
  bet to save the audio is through a combination of cables and Audacity. Unfortunately,
  my computer only recognizes my aux cord as headphones, and I cannot treat my JVC
  product as a microphone when using Audacity. I have two cables - one aux with two
  3.5mm ends, and one cable that has a male 3.5mm on one end and the other end has
  two male parts, white and yellow RCA jacks. How, if at all, can I use my JVC player
  to preserve the tapes I have? Is there a special cord combination I may be able
  to put together that won't put me out of house and home (I'm unemployed and in a
  somewhat difficult spot financially, even a $20 purchase has me aghast sometimes)
  or would I be better off looking for a different product to record my tapes? A friend
  of mine is currently looking to rehome an old car radio with cassette player - Do
  those typically have RCA plugs, and would that be a way to go about this? Anything
  helps, even just correcting my terms so I can communicate what I'm looking for a
  little better - I'm in a space where I truly don't know what it is that I don't
  know. I'd love to be a part of saving some lost media, even if it seems a little
  silly. People put work into those Halloween tapes, dammit!

  be acceptable but not ideal). The mergeFs harddrives are connected to a Ubuntu server.
  And I am moving the whole lot to a new server running proxmox (that has a Ubuntu
  server running in VM). can anyone help me figure out if it's possible to migrate
  this to a ZFS pool that will do what I want. I also have looked at unRAID because
  it supports adding disks, but that is its own hypervisor. So are there alternative

  I suspect that folks around here will either have advice or know where to point
  me if I''m better served asking this somewhere else. I built out my homelab to learn
  and get a job in IT. Mission success there. I''ve since gotten into all kinds of
  stuff and have a need to rework my storage, but I''m not sure how best to set things
  up. Here''s what I''m looking to do: Complete separation of storage and compute
  Compute consists of a handful of VMs running on Proxmox, and critically, a Kubernetes
  cluster The cluster is currently running in VMs but I have plans to move just about
  everything into the cluster and move into SFF PCs This is partially why the complete
  separation is important, for flexibility and future migration Here''s what I have
  currently for equipment: Brocade switch with 48x 1gbe and 8x10gig sfp 2x 12 bay
  3.5" servers, one with Proxmox, one with TrueNAS 1x 24 bay 2.5" server Repurposed
  NetApp 24x 3.5" chassis, modified to work as DAS 4x 16gb spinners, currently in
  raidz1 ~32 old 2, 3, and 4gb spinners I found that K8s cluster was very unstable
  with my first setup, which was an iscsi target on the TrueNAS server. The iSCSI
  share was mounted in Proxmox with LVM to create K8s VM OS and NFS storage for containers.
  This got much better when I moved to a local 3x SSD zpool on the Proxmox host. I
  understand that the latency with spinners and over the network was likely the cause,
  but this doesn''t allow for the separation if like. Use here is all over - media
  server is the main thing currently, which for transcoding needs fast seq read/writes,
  K8s app dev for work, and all kinds of testing containers for work and home. I''d
  also like to put all VM storage remote as well to play around with some different
  compute setups. I''d really love to be able to fully wipe Proxmox and try out XCP-ng,
  or Azure HCI, stuff like that... It''s a lab, after all. I''m competent enough to
  implement a solution, but I guess not enough experience yet to design. I''m not
  afraid of complex setup, but I do need redundancy, particularly if putting these
  small drives to use as I don''t trust them - came for free with the NetApp shelf.
  So... Any suggestions on how to set this up for minimal latency and fast read/write?
  Ceph? Mirrored ZFS using all those small spinners? Dedicated ZFS pools for each
  K8s node? Caching layers? Not against additional equipment, within reason, if needed.'

  drives idle at 43-45 C which is ok, but could be a little better. So i thought about
  adding a new and better fan to the enclosure (Icy Box IB-3805-C31), but the fan
  never changes speeds, literally never. I don't let my drives spin down but if they
  were to, the fan does stop spinning after a while, afaik that's the only control
  the DAS has over the fan. So if i were to add a 2000rpm fan, would it instantly
  shoot up to that rpm and always spin that fast? Is there a way to control fan speed?
  I can't see the DAS's fan on any program controlling fan speed so that's something...
  Any idea on how it would behave? Any idea if there is a way to controll the fan
  speed? Thanks.

  an early-release coronavirus article with a $35.95 access fee for non-subscribers.
  The fury I felt brought tears to my eyes. Me and a few friends share that fury,
  so we gathered a collection of five-thousand scientific studies covering any article
  title containing “ coronav* ” from 1968-2020. The scope of the papers spans not
  only the 7 human coronaviruses, but up to 40 other Coronaviridae family strains.
  The Ebola virus showed us that every study counts. We are on the first step towards
  compiling a complete open-access Coronaviridae research catalog for the world’s
  scientists, journalists, and virology experts to draw from to fight the virus and
  save lives. Our project is illegal, but it’s the right thing to do in this crisis.
  We refuse to put copyright before human lives. Sharing everything we know about
  the virus is essential, which is why international scientists are openly sharing
  their coronavirus findings in an unprecedented way . Developing-world scientists
  often work without article access due to complex and expensive contract agreements
  between publishers, universities, and hospitals, relying on overseas colleagues
  to help them hunt down PDF files. The virus is not going to wait for this, so we
  need to act with conviction, now. To their credit, publishers made a few dozen papers
  open-access in the last few days, which you can find over at Elsevier’s Novel Coronavirus
  Information Center and Wiley’s Coronavirus collection. While Wiley is slating to
  shut down their collection in April, our collection won’t be shutting down anytime
  soon. We’re going to keep growing to help our scientists out, and you can help us
  complete the catalog by identifying any papers we missed. All extant Coronaviridae
  research, accessible in seconds, by any scientist in the world. It’s the least we
  can do to help. Methodology How did we do it? We scanned Sci-Hub ''s 80 million
  title collection for the coronavirus, then we extracted the titles and Digital Object
  Identifiers (DOI) to an index, and exported the PDF files to upload them to The-Eye.eu’s
  full-text search repository. How can I help? We always need developers. You can
  also help us identify new articles by joining our team spreadsheet here . Request
  access and you can begin adding new article titles to the list. You can also help
  share word of the collection with the scientific community by reaching out to journalists.
  Who is helping us? Our brave host is The-Eye.eu , a “non-profit, community driven
  platform dedicated to the archiving and long-term preservation of any and all data,”
  making this project just one of the many public access preservation projects they
  stand behind. You can aid projects like this one by donating toward their server
  bills. A thank you to Sci-Hub and Library Genesis. Last year communities across
  reddit (including r/seedboxes and r/DataHoarder ) came together in a mission to
  secure and preserve Sci-Hub and Library Genesis, collectively the two largest free
  and open non-profit library collections in the world: Sci-Hub’s 80-million scientific
  article database that made this project possible, and LibGen’s 2.5-million scientific-book
  collection. The libraries fulfill United Nations world development goals mandating
  the removal of restrictions on access to science, and they serve developing world
  doctors, academic researchers, and other experts in society with the knowledge they
  need to build a better world. Keeping these libraries open and thriving means saving
  lives, educating the world, and providing invaluable science to humanity’s global
  experts. Thank you to everyone involved in the project, The-Eye.eu for their support,
  and to all the scientists around the world working on behalf of humanity today.'

Content: 'iFixit and their guides are a great source for learning how to repair and
  fix electronics. They offer all their guides in PDF format, which I thought might
  be easier for viewing and self-containment then HTML. I''ve downloaded all their
  guides as PDFs, and put them into a single torrent. I think this is information
  that is very valuable to have offline - for power outages, remote travel/backpacking,
  the end of the world, etc. I''m hoping this can join some of your collections, beside
  Wikipedia and first aid pamphlets. Magnet link: magnet:?xt=urn:btih:ed9889445d52d7882e844bd926e1b547a2c00781&dn=pdfs.zip&tr=udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969%2Fannounce&tr=udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.opentrackr.org%3A1337%2Fannounce&tr=udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969%2Fannounce&tr=udp%3A%2F%2Fp4p.arenabg.com%3A1337%2Fannounce
  Torrent file The torrent is just a single ZIP file named pdfs.zip , that contains
  all the guides. It is about 60 gigabytes in total. Each guide is named by the name
  of the guide, for easy searching. Duplicate names were fixed by adding numbers to
  the end, as in guide name [2].pdf and guide name [3].pdf . All filenames are Windows
  safe. Keep in mind that my upload speeds are slow, and it may take a bit for your
  computer to find mine. But I have always-on server that is seeding it, so it will
  download eventually. The contents of the torrent will also be up on the Internet
  Archive here , they are downloading it now. If you want to replicate what I''ve
  done, or update the archive yourself (I will try and update it every so often),
  there are wget and python3 scripts and source files (like lists of urls) in that
  archive as well. Those files are not part of the torrent. If you have any questions,
  or plan on seeding, let me know below! EDIT: As I mentioned above, my upload speed
  is slow. The torrent will take a very long time initially, and there''s not much
  I can do about that. Feel free to come back in a couple days when there will be
  more than just me with a full copy.'

Content: 'After my recent comment on here blew up, I figured you all would get a kick
  out of this. TL;DR: We scraped the internet for any and all medical equipment repair
  documentation we could find. We ended up with over 13,000 PDFs across 5,000 medical
  devices, all uploaded to iFixit.com and available for free to anyone and everyone.
  ----- Hospitals are having trouble getting service information to fix medical equipment
  and manufacturers can’t keep pace with the growing demand for repair of critical
  hospital equipment. On top of that, biomedical technicians spend countless hours
  scouring the internet searching for crucial repair information. This is not a great
  way to run a health system. So we’ve been fixing that. Over the last two months,
  we’ve pivoted half our company to build the world’s most comprehensive medical equipment
  service database . We just posted more than 13,000 PDFs from hundreds of manufacturers—online
  and available for free. You can find them in our Medical Device category. This has
  been an absolutely massive undertaking, and we were fortunate to have the help and
  support of over 200 librarians and archivists from across the country. Archivists
  from university and public libraries, research institutes, insurance and software
  companies, and of course biomedical technicians themselves, all donated their valuable
  time. Collectively, they’ve contributed thousands of hours organizing piles of documents
  into a navigable, searchable system. Some medical manufacturers, like Mindray ,
  allow biomeds to access their manuals freely. A few more released select documents
  after the outbreak of COVID-19. But for their day-to-day work, biomeds have long
  relied on a rag-tag set of web resources to get the job done. Among the most popular
  is Frank’s Hospital Workshop , a Tanzania-based site that hosts hundreds of medical
  device manuals—it’s the unofficial biomed bible. But we wanted to make it easier
  for anyone to find the right manual, especially in an emergency. Some of the documents
  in our collection were already available. Others were not publicly posted until
  now . And it was important to us that this resource didn’t just duplicate existing
  resources, but improved accessibility in a meaningful way. To be very clear: iFixit
  will not make any money off of this project . We are providing hosting and curation
  free of charge, and free of advertising, to the medical community. We welcome manufacturers
  to join us and contribute toward an up-to-date central repository for the biomedical
  community, as well as biomedical technicians around the world to join iFixit’s repair
  community . No technician is an island, and we hope to facilitate an exchange of
  knowledge and troubleshooting. This medical repository is most useful if it’s collaboratively
  moderated by biomedical technicians, with our assistance.'

  I'd purchased a few months ago. A week ago I woke up to a TrueNas notification that
  a drive was faulted. I did some troubleshooting and wasn't able to recover any kind
  of connection to the drive. Plugging it in to a external adapter resulted in what
  sounded like a rock tumbler, so clearly it was beyond rescue. I started a RMA with
  SPD, and went back to work; expecting a few hours delay before hearing anything
  back. Later I realized I'd missed their almost immediate reply to the RMA request.
  I explained there was no way provide smart test results, and attached a video of
  my new rock tumbler. In short order the RMA# was provided. I shipped the faulted
  drive, and didn't think much of it. The drive was delivered yesterday and my replacement
  shipped this morning. Long story short, big kudos to ServerPartDeals for what is
  unprecedented customer service in the modern world; and to all the unsure shoppers,

Content: Building my first DIY NAS. Need 2+2 tb to start off with. Trying to be as
  cheap as possible. Will be storing all memories and irreplaceable things. Will get
  an external HDD for offsite backup. Also, I do not care about read write speeds.
  I just want my data to be safe and backed up at the end of the day for as cheap
  as possible, I will add new data maybe once a month if not even more rarely. I will
  be using my old motherboard (6 SATA ports) and processor. Will get a new 500 GB
  ssd for OS and new RAM. Now here is the dilemma. I am from India and WD Purples
  are selling for 5250 INR each, cheapest. Next up, WD Blue is also selling for 6000+
  INR. I can technically afford (but want to avoid at all costs) to get a 10TB UltraStar
  or EXOS for 22000 INR but I need two physical drives at least and my total storage
  need for backup right now or even 3 years later will not exceed 4-5TB. so a 10TB
  HDD will be useless, not to mention spending 45K INR on drives only (which is VERY
  VERY EXPENSIVE FOR ME). I know WD Purple glosses over write errors and can be bad.
  Chucking is equally expensive, if not more. Should I just get 2x 2tb WD Purple for
  10.5K INR and set up my backup server for now. Will add more HDDs later as needed
  (1-4 years later). Can I do anything to prevent the write errors? Also, if there
  is a cheaper way, especially in the long run, I would appreciate it. Currently I
  have ~2TB data which grows by like 200-400GB a year. I have thought of BluRay drives
  but I am unable to procure new BluRay drives cheap enough.

  from various websites... Send or comment links of videos you need downloaded. Currently
  going through POV livestreams/replays. NOTE: livestreams/POV are of the utmost importance.
  AKA Twitch/dlive/Facebook Live, etc. If you find any of these POV angles, please
  tag me directly in your comment, or PM me. These generally get taken down VERY fast
  by the livestream website. UPDATE: Thank you to everyone who shared links (and continue
  to do so). I am noticing that a lot of the content is now duplicates, or variations
  (crops, lower quality, etc) of the same content. So I have put all the content I
  have on MEGA. If I have replied to your comment then the content for sure is in
  this torrent. MEGA: https://mega.nz/folder/30MlkQib#RDOaGzmtFEHkxSYBaJSzVA (this
  is the prefered way of downloading) (This is sitting in at ~350GB as of Jan 10 3:00
  PM EST. Still adding content) UPDATE 2: Link should be working - MEGA contacted
  me and reinstated the account (and gave premium so I could upload more). I will
  be uploading more content that I find to the mega account. Still going through the
  comments, and the 900+ messages I have. Keep posting comments and I will upload
  them to the MEGA folder. UPDATE 3: "Bellingcat" has created a really efficient way

Content: Hello all! I have been hunting for the right location to ask my many, many
  questions. This may not be technical enough for this subreddit, but it seemed like
  the right place to go. I'm a big fan of physical media, likely casual to most here
  but to my friends I am perceived as intensely pro-physical media. As such, whenever
  people have spare tapes, CDs, DVDs, etc etc, I'm the man they throw them at. Unfortunately,
  I am horribly unfamiliar with the digitization process for everything except for
  CDs and DVDs, and even then I occasionally have hiccups. Recently I purchased the
  JVC RC-EZ38S CD Portable System (link to user manual) from a flea market to play
  some of my tapes and CDs, and realized I had a few tapes I'm unable to find anywhere
  online. Usually I wouldn't worry about my tapes growing old from wear because I
  can download songs and save them that way, but these tapes (mostly Halloween tracks)
  were impossible for me to find elsewhere, so I've been trying to preserve them.
  The JVC product I purchased plays CDs, cassette tapes, and the radio. It has one
  single 3.5mm jack, a headphone output. I have done some googling, and found my best
  bet to save the audio is through a combination of cables and Audacity. Unfortunately,
  my computer only recognizes my aux cord as headphones, and I cannot treat my JVC
  product as a microphone when using Audacity. I have two cables - one aux with two
  3.5mm ends, and one cable that has a male 3.5mm on one end and the other end has
  two male parts, white and yellow RCA jacks. How, if at all, can I use my JVC player
  to preserve the tapes I have? Is there a special cord combination I may be able
  to put together that won't put me out of house and home (I'm unemployed and in a
  somewhat difficult spot financially, even a $20 purchase has me aghast sometimes)
  or would I be better off looking for a different product to record my tapes? A friend
  of mine is currently looking to rehome an old car radio with cassette player - Do
  those typically have RCA plugs, and would that be a way to go about this? Anything
  helps, even just correcting my terms so I can communicate what I'm looking for a
  little better - I'm in a space where I truly don't know what it is that I don't
  know. I'd love to be a part of saving some lost media, even if it seems a little
  silly. People put work into those Halloween tapes, dammit!

Content: Is it possible to transition my setup from mergeFs+Snapraid to zfs without
  a lot of spare storage that I don't have? I currently have 2x4TB mergeFs setup,
  with a 4TB drive for Snapraid parity. (Total 8TB usable storage). - currently holding
  7TB of data I have purchased 2x4TB more drives. And ideally want to end up in a

  be acceptable but not ideal). The mergeFs harddrives are connected to a Ubuntu server.
  And I am moving the whole lot to a new server running proxmox (that has a Ubuntu
  server running in VM). can anyone help me figure out if it's possible to migrate
  this to a ZFS pool that will do what I want. I also have looked at unRAID because
  it supports adding disks, but that is its own hypervisor. So are there alternative
  ways of working that can work inside a proxmox VM?

Content: I know many people on here already recommended SPD as a source for fair priced
  disks. I just wanted to add my $.02 after a recent experience with a failed drive
  I'd purchased a few months ago. A week ago I woke up to a TrueNas notification that
  a drive was faulted. I did some troubleshooting and wasn't able to recover any kind
  of connection to the drive. Plugging it in to a external adapter resulted in what
  sounded like a rock tumbler, so clearly it was beyond rescue. I started a RMA with
  SPD, and went back to work; expecting a few hours delay before hearing anything
  back. Later I realized I'd missed their almost immediate reply to the RMA request.
  I explained there was no way provide smart test results, and attached a video of
  my new rock tumbler. In short order the RMA# was provided. I shipped the faulted
  drive, and didn't think much of it. The drive was delivered yesterday and my replacement
  shipped this morning. Long story short, big kudos to ServerPartDeals for what is
  unprecedented customer service in the modern world; and to all the unsure shoppers,
  spend your money with SPD.

  from Sci-Hub, no one is in touch with Sci-Hub, and I don''t speak for Sci-Hub in
  any form. Always refer to sci-hub.do for the latest from Sci-Hub directly. This
  is a data preservation effort for just the articles, and does not help Sci-Hub directly.  Sci-Hub
  is not in any further imminent danger than it always has been, and is not at greater
  risk of being shut-down than before. A Rescue Mission for Sci-Hub and Open Science
  Elsevier and the USDOJ have declared war against Sci-Hub and open science. The era
  of Sci-Hub and Alexandra standing alone in this fight must end. We have to take
  a stand with her. On May 7th, Sci-Hub''s Alexandra Elbakyan revealed that the FBI
  has been wiretapping her accounts for over 2 years. This news comes after Twitter
  silenced the official Sci_Hub twitter account because Indian academics were organizing
  on it against Elsevier. Sci-Hub itself is currently frozen and has not downloaded
  any new articles since December 2020. This rescue mission is focused on seeding
  the article collection in order to prepare for a potential Sci-Hub shutdown. Alexandra
  Elbakyan of Sci-Hub, bookwarrior of Library Genesis , Aaron Swartz , and countless
  unnamed others have fought to free science from the grips of for-profit publishers.
  Today, they do it working in hiding, alone, without acknowledgment, in fear of imprisonment,
  and even now wiretapped by the FBI. They sacrifice everything for one vision: Open
  Science. Why do they do it? They do it so that humble scholars on the other side
  of the planet can practice medicine, create science, fight for democracy, teach,
  and learn. People like Alexandra Elbakyan would give up their personal freedom for
  that one goal: to free knowledge. For that, Elsevier Corp (RELX, market cap: 50
  billion) wants to silence her, wants to see her in prison, and wants to shut Sci-Hub
  down. It''s time we sent Elsevier and the USDOJ a clearer message about the fate
  of Sci-Hub and open science: we are the library, we do not get silenced, we do not
  shut down our computers, and we are many. Rescue Mission for Sci-Hub If you have
  been following the story, then you know that this is not our first rescue mission.
  We protected the Library Genesis book collection We unlocked over 5,000 COVID-19
  research articles We successfully petitioned publishers to unlock their COVID-19
  paywalls bookwarrior, the founder of Library Genesis, took his library onto the
  de-centralized and un-censorable IPFS web Next? Make Sci-Hub un-censorable too.
  Rescue Target A handful of Library Genesis seeders are currently seeding the Sci-Hub
  torrents. There are 850 scihub torrents , each containing 100,000 scientific articles,
  to a total of 85 million scientific articles: 77TB. This is the complete Sci-Hub
  database. We need to protect this. Rescue Team Wave 1: We need 85 datahoarders to
  store and seed 1TB of articles each, 10 torrents in total. Download 10 random torrents
  from the scimag index of < 12 seeders , then load the torrents onto your client
  and seed for as long as you can. The articles are coded by DOI and in zip files.
  Wave 2: Reach out to 10 good friends to ask them to grab just 1 random torrent (100GB).
  That''s 850 seeders. We are now the library. Final Wave: Development for an open
  source Sci-Hub. freereadorg/awesome-libgen is a collection of open source achievements
  based on the Sci-Hub and Library Genesis databases. Open source de-centralization
  of Sci-Hub is the ultimate goal here, and this begins with the data, but it is going
  to take years of developer sweat to carry these libraries into the future. Heartfelt
  thanks to the r/datahoarder and r/seedboxes communities, seedbox.io and NFOrce for
  your support for previous missions and your love for science.'
