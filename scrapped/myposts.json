{"Title": "Archiving ~500 raw comic books", "Author": "u/AndroidAssistant", "Content": "I'm trying to digitize my father's ~500 comic book collection before his birthday in August so he can read them on his tablet. He gifted them to me a while back because, while he wouldn't admit it, his eyes are starting to go, and he couldn't enjoy them anymore. With the tablet he can zoom in as far as needed so I know he would love to revisit the comics once they are in digital form. Everything is in pristine condition with sleeves and backers, but there is nothing insanely valuable in the collection. He has a couple that are worth something, but most sit at >$10. That said, it would crush him if any were damaged so the scanning method must be non-destructive. What I have tried: Czur Aura Pro Super quick, but random cropping and glare for days, even using the side lights. I tried using it with the official light box, outside the box, with 1-5 additional lights, with only external lights at every angle known to man, in a diffusion light box, with polarizers, etc. The only thing that worked 100% of the time was scanning while sitting on my back porch on an overcast day. I opened a ticket with their support and the response was \"Make your room light bright enough, but do not have direct light shining on the book.\". They didn't address the cropping issues. Epson Perfection V600 Epson Scan - Impressive for OEM software but inconsistent and changing the framing is a pain unless things are at perfect right angles. VueScan - Sometimes it decides just not to scan, sometimes it scans and the image is black. When it does scan it does fine, but the auto skew is ~90% accurate which may as well be 0 because I have to adjust every single picture. Silverfast - I was surprised at how much better the scans look, but the scans take 2-3 times as long as the Vue or Epson software. Also I have to take a prescan every time I move the page? At this point I'm ready to hire a service if anyone has any suggestions, but I would really prefer to do the scanning myself because I plan on at least completing the series that he has, and probably expanding on them. I do have an R10 and an M50, so I could try some sort of diybookscanner.com solution, but that is a lot of effort for something that may or may not have different results."},

I've got two drives right now (8TB Seagate Archive drives) that died suddenly. One seems like it could be a bad logic board and I do have another with not just the same general board but the same batch? (same qr code) but haven't transferred the ROM between the boards to see if that will address it. The other (the one that died today while trying to transfer data to a new drive) will spin up but then makes a sound like the heads are seeking twice and then spins down. As I understand that's likely a hardware problem and not as home fixable. While the data one these drives aren't critical it would be nice to be able to better diagnose the problems to see if it is worth the hassle to try to recover them."},

As I work on developing a robust backup strategy for my NAS, I wonder if QNAP offers a native solution that allows splitting backups across multiple external drives automatically, without manually dividing my directories into chunks of 4 TB each. The rationale is that a 24 TB backup cannot fit on a single 4 TB external HDD. This becomes even more apparent if I expand to a usable 144 TB in the future. In that case, it would be impossible to find a single 144 TB external drive, as such drives simply do not exist.

Important pictures are backed up, the most important of which are printed out. My consideration here is whether or not I get a high capacity internal HDD @ 7200 RPM or if I buy a high capacity portable HDD that can take abuse and is less likely to be damaged by physical adjustments and movements. This is rarely a concern in my day to day but I live in an earthquake prone area and I would agonise over losing everything to some shaking dirt. I can't do both due to financial constraints at the moment but the decision is as follows; Do I get a second external USB HDD that will be slower and have inferior transfer rates BUT be more protected in event of disaster and any other events that may happen (dog with zoomies for instance.) or Do I get a more efficient and practical internal HDD (I imagine its also cheaper) that I suspect to be significantly more fragile and susceptible to sudden movements and will likely be lost in the aforementioned events. If the internal is selected, should I acquire this before the sale ends? If I should go with an external what should I acquire? I'd like something larger than my current 5TB. I haven't used more than 1.1TB on it but I'd rather kick the can of running out of space a few more years down the road."},

This may not be technical enough for this subreddit, but it seemed like the right place to go. I'm a big fan of physical media, likely casual to most here but to my friends I am perceived as intensely pro-physical media. As such, whenever people have spare tapes, CDs, DVDs, etc etc, I'm the man they throw them at. Unfortunately, I am horribly unfamiliar with the digitization process for everything except for CDs and DVDs, and even then I occasionally have hiccups. Recently I purchased the JVC RC-EZ38S CD Portable System (link to user manual) from a flea market to play some of my tapes and CDs, and realized I had a few tapes I'm unable to find anywhere online. Usually I wouldn't worry about my tapes growing old from wear because I can download songs and save them that way, but these tapes (mostly Halloween tracks) were impossible for me to find elsewhere, so I've been trying to preserve them. The JVC product I purchased plays CDs, cassette tapes, and the radio. It has one single 3.5mm jack, a headphone output. I have done some googling, and found my best bet to save the audio is through a combination of cables and Audacity. Unfortunately, my computer only recognizes my aux cord as headphones, and I cannot treat my JVC product as a microphone when using Audacity. I have two cables - one aux with two 3.5mm ends, and one cable that has a male 3.5mm on one end and the other end has two male parts, white and yellow RCA jacks. How, if at all, can I use my JVC player to preserve the tapes I have? Is there a special cord combination I may be able to put together that won't put me out of house and home (I'm unemployed and in a somewhat difficult spot financially, even a $20 purchase has me aghast sometimes) or would I be better off looking for a different product to record my tapes? A friend of mine is currently looking to rehome an old car radio with cassette player - Do those typically have RCA plugs, and would that be a way to go about this? Anything helps, even just correcting my terms so I can communicate what I'm looking for a little better - I'm in a space where I truly don't know what it is that I don't know. I'd love to be a part of saving some lost media, even if it seems a little silly. People put work into those Halloween tapes, dammit!"},

I have 3 disks, one parity and two data drives. They're using XFS in Unraid. I want to use ext4 in OMV. I have formatted the parity drive to ext4, and planned to move data from disk 1 to the parity drive, then format disk 1 to ext4, and then move all data from disk 2 to disk 1 and make disk 2 the new parity drive for SnapRAID. However, I just realized I have hard links from the arr suite, spanning over both data disks ... How can I migrate and preserve the hard links? Preferably without having to move all data to one disk in Unraid before migrating. EDIT: For those of you wondering why I'm switching, I'm actually switching from Unraid to Proxmox, but I'll use OMV to handle my disks (combination of ZFS and ext4) and shares."},

I built out my homelab to learn and get a job in IT. Mission success there. I've since gotten into all kinds of stuff and have a need to rework my storage, but I'm not sure how best to set things up. Here's what I'm looking to do: Complete separation of storage and compute Compute consists of a handful of VMs running on Proxmox, and critically, a Kubernetes cluster The cluster is currently running in VMs but I have plans to move just about everything into the cluster and move into SFF PCs This is partially why the complete separation is important, for flexibility and future migration Here's what I have currently for equipment: Brocade switch with 48x 1gbe and 8x10gig sfp 2x 12 bay 3.5\" servers, one with Proxmox, one with TrueNAS 1x 24 bay 2.5\" server Repurposed NetApp 24x 3.5\" chassis, modified to work as DAS 4x 16gb spinners, currently in raidz1 ~32 old 2, 3, and 4gb spinners I found that K8s cluster was very unstable with my first setup, which was an iscsi target on the TrueNAS server. The iSCSI share was mounted in Proxmox with LVM to create K8s VM OS and NFS storage for containers. This got much better when I moved to a local 3x SSD zpool on the Proxmox host. I understand that the latency with spinners and over the network was likely the cause, but this doesn't allow for the separation if like. Use here is all over - media server is the main thing currently, which for transcoding needs fast seq read/writes, K8s app dev for work, and all kinds of testing containers for work and home. I'd also like to put all VM storage remote as well to play around with some different compute setups. I'd really love to be able to fully wipe Proxmox and try out XCP-ng, or Azure HCI, stuff like that... It's a lab, after all. I'm competent enough to implement a solution, but I guess not enough experience yet to design. I'm not afraid of complex setup, but I do need redundancy, particularly if putting these small drives to use as I don't trust them - came for free with the NetApp shelf. So...

I understand that the latency with spinners and over the network was likely the cause, but this doesn't allow for the separation if like. Use here is all over - media server is the main thing currently, which for transcoding needs fast seq read/writes, K8s app dev for work, and all kinds of testing containers for work and home. I'd also like to put all VM storage remote as well to play around with some different compute setups. I'd really love to be able to fully wipe Proxmox and try out XCP-ng, or Azure HCI, stuff like that... It's a lab, after all. I'm competent enough to implement a solution, but I guess not enough experience yet to design.

I was thinking maybe 8Tb+8Tb+6Tb+6Tb in the ZFS pool, then 16Tb+3Tb as single volumes on my second NAS.

{"Title": "Seeking Advice on Cost-Effective Backup Solutions for Multiple Hard Drives (beginner) - Thoughts on Bvckup 2?", "Author": "u/AlvTellez", "Content": "I have several larger hard drives: 5TB portable drive connected to my HTPC for films and series via Plex Two unused 8TB drives 4TB drive containing important media (that doesn't fit in my laptop and/or is more important) Initially, I considered getting a Synology NAS, but with less than 10TB of actual data, it seems like overkill, especially since I rarely access this data and usually keep the drives unplugged, except for the 5TB drive that's always connected to my HTPC (I also don't really need a NAS for my Plex needs, since I already have the HTPC as a server for that). After reading some posts, I thought about purchasing a license for Bvckup 2, which is more cost-effective and would allow me to use my other drives for backup. My plan is to transfer data from the 5TB drive to one of the 8TB drives and periodically back up the data to the other 8TB drive. If I run out of space, I could use the 4TB drive similarly and back up data to the other 5TB drive. While this might sound inefficient to experienced data hoarders, how bad/good is this idea? Are there any other software options that could simplify this process, compared to manually copying and pasting data between drives?"},

I built out my homelab to learn and get a job in IT. Mission success there. I've since gotten into all kinds of stuff and have a need to rework my storage, but I'm not sure how best to set things up. Here's what I'm looking to do: Complete separation of storage and compute Compute consists of a handful of VMs running on Proxmox, and critically, a Kubernetes cluster The cluster is currently running in VMs but I have plans to move just about everything into the cluster and move into SFF PCs This is partially why the complete separation is important, for flexibility and future migration Here's what I have currently for equipment: Brocade switch with 48x 1gbe and 8x10gig sfp 2x 12 bay 3.5\" servers, one with Proxmox, one with TrueNAS 1x 24 bay 2.5\" server Repurposed NetApp 24x 3.5\" chassis, modified to work as DAS 4x 16gb spinners, currently in raidz1 ~32 old 2, 3, and 4gb spinners I found that K8s cluster was very unstable with my first setup, which was an iscsi target on the TrueNAS server. The iSCSI share was mounted in Proxmox with LVM to create K8s VM OS and NFS storage for containers. This got much better when I moved to a local 3x SSD zpool on the Proxmox host. I understand that the latency with spinners and over the network was likely the cause, but this doesn't allow for the separation if like. Use here is all over - media server is the main thing currently, which for transcoding needs fast seq read/writes, K8s app dev for work, and all kinds of testing containers for work and home.

{"Title": "Why is XFS not more popular? Are there are any concerns with XFS still?", "Author": "u/ECrispy", "Content": "This is for home desktop usage, not servers/data centers where XFS is far more common. performance - in every test I could find, XFS is near the top, beating btrfs/ext4. Its esp good for parallel workloads and almost everything on a modern desktop is like that. The only perf concern I read about is it used to have higher cpu usage for updating metadata but I believe thats been fixed and no longer relevant? (I think for most users, performance in benchmarks may not be noticeable and other features matter more, but its still an important consideration) SSD/OS installs - XFS is almost as fast as f2fs for these. I see no reason why anyone would use f2fs on anything other than a sd card or on any NAND device with wear leveling. CoW/snapshots - this is no doubt a very powerful feature of zfs/btrfs. But I see very little mention of reflinks/snapshots on XFS which can achieve a lot of this. They are not atomic but enough to satisfy a lot of use cases. I don't see support for this in the usual tools like snapper/timeshift either. XFS also has support for deduping. All of this comes without the usual cost of CoW other features - dynamic inodes (on ext4 an inode for every 16kb/256kb is wasteful, even if most people never notice it), automatic fsck, journalling (sure, copied from ext3, but thats not a bad thing) stability/reliability - I don't think there should be any doubt about this. Its a proven enterprise class fs with a hallowed pedigree and reputation, is now backed by RHEL and has probably seen more active development than most other file systems. The biggest factor seems to be that the default ext4 is good enough, and frankly most people will not care or know about, and should not care, about the underlying fs. There are also distros like Fedora/OpenSuse that used to use XFS as the default and have switched to btrfs. I don't know of anything that uses XFS as default except unRaid now - unRaid is used to manage TBs by home users and that probably says something. The only concerns I've found are - a) it doesn't support shrinking a volume. how common is this anyway? I've never seen any home user need to do this, 99% of the time you only need this when you are installing another OS on the same ssd/hdd and need to shrink your current /, which is an advanced use case. b)supposedly XFS doesn't handle hw failures. Even on this I found no consensus - some people say its risky and can corrupt with no recovery, others say even with a forced  shutdown its safe. I'm not sure if its any less robust than ext4/btrfs? Is this actually a concern these days?"},

{"Title": "Recertified EXOS X18 constantly reading?", "Author": "u/wiadrovit", "Content": "Hey there Guys, I've bought a recertified EXOS X18 12TB for my NAS. The drive isn't exactly loud and it performs as I would expect, but there's one thing that I can't walk past - it acts as if it was doing something, even when completely idle. The drive lives in my Sabrent DS-SC5B hdd enclosure which I've been using for over a year now and which I'm very satisfied with. Video: https://imgur.com/a/o39cfd8 (it's the second one from the top - as you can see its LED is blinking in a regular manner). I've read that EXOS drives have their own APM feature which can be disabled using seachest tool. I've managed to successfully disable both EPC as well as the power balance feature, but that didn't change anything, the LED still blinks and I can hear a regular, gentle cracking sound as if something was read/written. The drive is mounted on my Debian installation and I've confirmed that no process is using it. What's weird is that activities stop as soon as I unmount the drive (and start again as soon as I mount it back). In fact, this is a second drive that does the same thing. I've returned previous one to the seller as I've felt something is not right with it. Both were manufactured (or rather reassembled?) back in March 2024. I should add that I have another EXOS drive (X16 16TB sitting in my backup device) and it doesn't act this way. Is it normal for these drives or do you think I should return this one as well and go for something else? It isn't that much annoying, I am just worried that if the head keeps flying all the time, the drive will wear sooner and might die prematurely. Thanks for any advice."},

I'm wondering if there's an app similar to CamScanner but more appropriate for photographs? Or a different method altogether. I know some people melt the glue keeping the spine together, scan the pages individually, and then glue everything back on. This wouldn't work for all of the books in my collection- but I have considered trying it on a handful of them. I'm just a little scared of screwing the process up. Thanks in advance."},

Its esp good for parallel workloads and almost everything on a modern desktop is like that. The only perf concern I read about is it used to have higher cpu usage for updating metadata but I believe thats been fixed and no longer relevant? (I think for most users, performance in benchmarks may not be noticeable and other features matter more, but its still an important consideration) SSD/OS installs - XFS is almost as fast as f2fs for these. I see no reason why anyone would use f2fs on anything other than a sd card or on any NAND device with wear leveling. CoW/snapshots - this is no doubt a very powerful feature of zfs/btrfs. But I see very little mention of reflinks/snapshots on XFS which can achieve a lot of this. They are not atomic but enough to satisfy a lot of use cases. I don't see support for this in the usual tools like snapper/timeshift either. XFS also has support for deduping. All of this comes without the usual cost of CoW other features - dynamic inodes (on ext4 an inode for every 16kb/256kb is wasteful, even if most people never notice it), automatic fsck, journalling (sure, copied from ext3, but thats not a bad thing) stability/reliability - I don't think there should be any doubt about this. Its a proven enterprise class fs with a hallowed pedigree and reputation, is now backed by RHEL and has probably seen more active development than most other file systems. The biggest factor seems to be that the default ext4 is good enough, and frankly most people will not care or know about, and should not care, about the underlying fs. There are also distros like Fedora/OpenSuse that used to use XFS as the default and have switched to btrfs. I don't know of anything that uses XFS as default except unRaid now - unRaid is used to manage TBs by home users and that probably says something. The only concerns I've found are - a) it doesn't support shrinking a volume. how common is this anyway? I've never seen any home user need to do this, 99% of the time you only need this when you are installing another OS on the same ssd/hdd and need to shrink your current /, which is an advanced use case. b)supposedly XFS doesn't handle hw failures.

I've just had all 3 drives in my desktop PC suddenly have problems. Thank god I can still read/write to the drives though. It's just god awful slow, especially during data transfers, where it will render the whole OS unusable until it's done. So that was a lot of pain and agony to temporarily move everything to the spare PC and laptops I have laying around (PC has 1tb, laptops have 1.5tb and 4.5tb). Means I now have no backups at all, since I still haven't finished setting up my work PC to be my off-site backup PC yet (it's basically manage/byo PC at my work BC it's such a small store). Annoying as well since that PC hosts my active directory and vaultwarden as well as the file server (thankfully I had a secondary active directory server set up, but no vaultwarden). Gotta love Crucial NVMes. All of them only 11 months old. Never again. 2 of 3 RMAs processed but I still gotta get data off of the third (OS drive) before I can post that.

For context, I'm mostly a hobbyist photographer that wants to just keep my data safe and I don't believe I'd have a need for most of what a NAS offers, so I'm looking into DAS/JBOD as a solution. I currently have around 6TB of photo/video I consider \"important\" enough to backup. My current setup is just a single 14 TB WD External HD which is not really being backed up anywhere so I'd like to improve my setup. At the core, I'm currently planning on doing the following: Buying a new 8TB HDD that I'll be \"working off of\", and moving all of my existing data into it Buying a 4 bay DAS, either using 2 drives for now for RAID1 or buying 4 for RAID4/5 (??) to periodically mirror data from the single 8TB drive onto. Using Backblaze to backup my PC + DAS. Does this setup make sense for my needs? If it does make sense, does anybody have any particular product recommendations for the DAS/JBOD and if there's any specific thing to look for in the type of drive(s) to purchase? Is this perhaps overkill for the use case? Please let me know if I'm not providing enough information, thanks."},

The only perf concern I read about is it used to have higher cpu usage for updating metadata but I believe thats been fixed and no longer relevant? (I think for most users, performance in benchmarks may not be noticeable and other features matter more, but its still an important consideration) SSD/OS installs - XFS is almost as fast as f2fs for these. I see no reason why anyone would use f2fs on anything other than a sd card or on any NAND device with wear leveling. CoW/snapshots - this is no doubt a very powerful feature of zfs/btrfs. But I see very little mention of reflinks/snapshots on XFS which can achieve a lot of this. They are not atomic but enough to satisfy a lot of use cases. I don't see support for this in the usual tools like snapper/timeshift either. XFS also has support for deduping. All of this comes without the usual cost of CoW other features - dynamic inodes (on ext4 an inode for every 16kb/256kb is wasteful, even if most people never notice it), automatic fsck, journalling (sure, copied from ext3, but thats not a bad thing) stability/reliability - I don't think there should be any doubt about this.

I've never seen any home user need to do this, 99% of the time you only need this when you are installing another OS on the same ssd/hdd and need to shrink your current /, which is an advanced use case. b)supposedly XFS doesn't handle hw failures.

{"Title": "Recertified EXOS X18 constantly reading?", "Author": "u/wiadrovit", "Content": "Hey there Guys, I've bought a recertified EXOS X18 12TB for my NAS. The drive isn't exactly loud and it performs as I would expect, but there's one thing that I can't walk past - it acts as if it was doing something, even when completely idle. The drive lives in my Sabrent DS-SC5B hdd enclosure which I've been using for over a year now and which I'm very satisfied with. Video: https://imgur.com/a/o39cfd8 (it's the second one from the top - as you can see its LED is blinking in a regular manner). I've read that EXOS drives have their own APM feature which can be disabled using seachest tool. I've managed to successfully disable both EPC as well as the power balance feature, but that didn't change anything, the LED still blinks and I can hear a regular, gentle cracking sound as if something was read/written. The drive is mounted on my Debian installation and I've confirmed that no process is using it. What's weird is that activities stop as soon as I unmount the drive (and start again as soon as I mount it back). In fact, this is a second drive that does the same thing. I've returned previous one to the seller as I've felt something is not right with it. Both were manufactured (or rather reassembled?) back in March 2024. I should add that I have another EXOS drive (X16 16TB sitting in my backup device) and it doesn't act this way. Is it normal for these drives or do you think I should return this one as well and go for something else? It isn't that much annoying, I am just worried that if the head keeps flying all the time, the drive will wear sooner and might die prematurely. Thanks for any advice."},

{"Title": "Getting creative and hacky with SFF as NAS.", "Author": "u/kkgmgfn", "Content": "Trigger Warning : This post is for DataHoarders + SFF enthusiasts. So please don't come saying get a 2TB NVME, get a 2.5 SATA SSD and yap yap yap.. And I have other systems too. One EATX, One MFF, Two SFF and One HTPC. So I am not a new builder. Posting here since it will be more appropriate than posting in Homelab or DataHoarder sub. As we know it we have very limited SFF cases with HDD support. Manufacturers hardly make them anymore. Some options that we have today: Node 304: Outdated and front panel is very restrictive. 92mm fans in front are noisy as they are 3pin. In my country I can't find any 92mm fan. Jonsbo N series: Pat on the back for Jonsbo on launching several SFF NAS cases back to back. They feel like they have restrictive airflow. They aren't available in my country. SAMA IM 01 and its copies: Supports 4 - 5. A cheap knock of this is available. But is an option. So my question is have you guys though about squeezing extra HDDs in cases like Deepcool CH 160, Coolermaster NR200P etc. For example if I can use rear fan mount for 120 AIO intake then does 120 fan slot above have motherboard has hinges for 3. 5\"HDD? Does it have space to tuck one below a dual slot dual fan GPU. I know 1 3.5\" HDD can go on front panel when I use a SFX PSU. Similarly for NR200P. More suggestions are welcome. I'll use a Noctua L9i or 120 AIO as I have then lying around. I wish this post to be open for coming years so people can get ideas and inspiration from the comments."},

My current laptop is an old HP and I have yet to decide between a new Windows laptop or a Chromebook. I have a Plex library I would like to expand, even bought an external DVD reader to start the library. I don't necessarily need NAS. Plugging something into the TV or my laptop would be fine when I want to watch something on Plex (which isn't very often). The same goes for when I need to do a regular backup of files. I would prefer to buy something once instead of paying a monthly subscription and to not add another constant draw on our power supply. Most of the storage is for movies/shows, photos, and PDF scans of documents from when I went paperless. I would like to add music to this once I figure out a few things.

I guess my questions are as followed: What/how many tests need to be run on a refurb drive? I've seen some posts listing multiple long tests and others just saying a few SMART tests. Is there any general consensus? Badblocks is on Linux only, would that work on something like WSL? Or would I have to get a Linux machine/VM setup? I have a Pi 3 collecting dust, could that be used? How long would testing the drives take? I've seen that a full badblocks 4 pass run can take days or even a week of 24/7 running just for one drive. Does that sound right? I was thinking about using a secondary machine like my old Thinkpad if it was going to take a week. My desktop (where the drive will eventually end up) is in use daily, and I'd be a bit concerned about leaving it on but not killing the test accidentally. I'm a bit new to all this, only having a 2TB and 4TB drive for the past few years. Any help in making sense of all this would be appreciated."},

{"Title": "Ripping entire Russian Encyclopedia - viable?", "Author": "u/gulisav", "Content": "I'm not extremely tech savy, so I have some possibly silly questions. Two days ago it's been announced that Great Russian Encyclopedia has been given no funding this year at all and the encyclopedia will be discontinued. (The encyclopedia is a heir to the Great Soviet Encyclopedia, and is fairly decent as far as general encyclopedias go.) Apparently Russia has bigger priorities than funding an encyclopedia... So, I think I might try my hand at saving the encyclopedia's online edition, before it 404s. Now, there are two domains, bigenc and old.bigenc (both .ru domains), and I'll focus on the latter. It seems fairly simple to rip, because each encyclopedic article has a corresponding PDF file, with the URLs only changing their final number (with 6 or 7 digits). I could produce a list of all the possible URLs in Excel. However, if I were to feed that list to a download manager, I'm wondering if that would cause any serious issues on the part of the server. There's probably close to a hundred thousand articles available on the site, and the downloader would also have to check possibly millions of URLs that contain no PDFs. Would this be like a sort of borderline DDOS attack? Could my requests be blocked? Furthermore, even if I rip all that stuff, it would result in thousands of files with nothing in particular to identify them, as the filenames are just numbers. Is there a way to derive the article titles from the text within the PDFs (which ofc include the title of the article) and rename the files accordingly? (The PDFs themselves are small in size, so I'm not worrying about space constraints.)"},

{"Title": "Have joined the club", "Author": "u/mdwkelly", "Content": "Good day all. Well I have joined the club and am now the proud owner of a Supermicro 45 Bay JBOD Expansion Server Shelf 847E16-RJBOD1 with ~30 drives and ~460TB. Currently have it hooked up via 2 SFF-8088 to SFF-8088 cables to a LSI 9201-16e 6Gbps 16-lane external SAS HBA installed in my \"server\". This is replacing my previous setup with the same \"server\", 2 x LSI 9201-16e 6Gbps 16-lane external SAS HBA cards with 8 x SFF-8088 to 4 SATA cables running to 8 x RSV-SATA-Cage-34 that are/were on a couple of shelves. Been up and running for about a week and thoughts so far are: It looks cool in the 4-post 42U rack It is loud! (I knew it was loud but that holy s#$% moment when you first power it up) snapraid backup/scrub is only happening at about 2/3 the speed of before (sort of knew this as well) that was a lot of screws to remove the drives from the RSV caddies and screw them into the JBOD caddies. It looks cool! As mentioned, I have it hooked up via 2 SFF-8088 to SFF-8088 cables, one for each backplane, and am wondering if I can hook up the other 2 SFF-8088 ports on the JBOD with two more cables to get some additional speed. I did read the manual it it discusses the other two ports are used for daisy-chaining but you never know. Not being one to let well enough alone, I am now on the journey to repackage my two \"servers\", one from above and the other used for acquiring linux ISO's, into a couple of 2U cases so I can get them nicely into the rack. For the latter, am thinking about a RackChoice MicroATX/Mini-ITX 2U Rackmount Server Chassis as I am running a mitx MB and a couple of 3.5 drives and a couple of SSD's with no add-on cards so should fit just nice.

{"Title": "Ripping entire Russian Encyclopedia - viable?", "Author": "u/gulisav", "Content": "I'm not extremely tech savy, so I have some possibly silly questions. Two days ago it's been announced that Great Russian Encyclopedia has been given no funding this year at all and the encyclopedia will be discontinued. (The encyclopedia is a heir to the Great Soviet Encyclopedia, and is fairly decent as far as general encyclopedias go.) Apparently Russia has bigger priorities than funding an encyclopedia... So, I think I might try my hand at saving the encyclopedia's online edition, before it 404s. Now, there are two domains, bigenc and old.bigenc (both .ru domains), and I'll focus on the latter. It seems fairly simple to rip, because each encyclopedic article has a corresponding PDF file, with the URLs only changing their final number (with 6 or 7 digits). I could produce a list of all the possible URLs in Excel. However, if I were to feed that list to a download manager, I'm wondering if that would cause any serious issues on the part of the server. There's probably close to a hundred thousand articles available on the site, and the downloader would also have to check possibly millions of URLs that contain no PDFs. Would this be like a sort of borderline DDOS attack? Could my requests be blocked? Furthermore, even if I rip all that stuff, it would result in thousands of files with nothing in particular to identify them, as the filenames are just numbers.

{"Title": "Have joined the club", "Author": "u/mdwkelly", "Content": "Good day all. Well I have joined the club and am now the proud owner of a Supermicro 45 Bay JBOD Expansion Server Shelf 847E16-RJBOD1 with ~30 drives and ~460TB. Currently have it hooked up via 2 SFF-8088 to SFF-8088 cables to a LSI 9201-16e 6Gbps 16-lane external SAS HBA installed in my \"server\". This is replacing my previous setup with the same \"server\", 2 x LSI 9201-16e 6Gbps 16-lane external SAS HBA cards with 8 x SFF-8088 to 4 SATA cables running to 8 x RSV-SATA-Cage-34 that are/were on a couple of shelves. Been up and running for about a week and thoughts so far are: It looks cool in the 4-post 42U rack It is loud! (I knew it was loud but that holy s#$% moment when you first power it up) snapraid backup/scrub is only happening at about 2/3 the speed of before (sort of knew this as well) that was a lot of screws to remove the drives from the RSV caddies and screw them into the JBOD caddies. It looks cool! As mentioned, I have it hooked up via 2 SFF-8088 to SFF-8088 cables, one for each backplane, and am wondering if I can hook up the other 2 SFF-8088 ports on the JBOD with two more cables to get some additional speed. I did read the manual it it discusses the other two ports are used for daisy-chaining but you never know. Not being one to let well enough alone, I am now on the journey to repackage my two \"servers\", one from above and the other used for acquiring linux ISO's, into a couple of 2U cases so I can get them nicely into the rack.

Had to manually add it to the battery optimization exclusion list on a OnePlus device (like in 3 different places, for background running, Optimize Battery Use etc.), or it would lose connection.

Ideally, every change would automatically get synced between both computers, through a cloud storage provider (that also stores the files for access from outside), as long as either computer is connected to the internet. Now, plenty of services offer this, in its most basic form. I get 1TB OneDrive though my parents' family plan and OneDrive is pretty nice. It integrates well enough into Windows. But there is one major limitation that makes it pretty much unsuitable for me: I don't want all my syncable data to be in one single folder. I want it spread out over different folders and even drives, because I run quite a few different drives with different purposes. Is there a service that basically offers a way to set custom endpoints for syncable folders? Say I have a cloud folder /Files , then I want a client that runs on any connected computer where I can set /Files to be synced to G:\\Files , or to C:\\Users\\some_user\\Documents\\CloudFiles on another computer?

In this case, is it okay to just build a decently powerful modern personal desktop - killing 2 birds with 1 s tone, instead of building 2 computers, one for desktop (desperately need the upgrade now) and one specifically for a server/nas? Is this totally okay? I live by myself so aside from being a personal computer with data storage, it'll just be serving me alone at home. To be honest, at the moment, I pretty much just consume media on my desktop, so even nas/media server features like plex, jellyfins aren't even 100% necessary - though nice to have perhaps in the future. Summary : Decently powerful personal desktop with a focus on datahoarding/data storage that can also perform some server side of things like running VMs, and other homelab things down the road. OS : FreeBSD with ZFS + ECC Memory CASE : thinking of a big case like Fractal Design Define 7 XL that is capable of holding 14-18 HDDs. MOBO : SSD : What's a good NVMe 2.0 ?(maybe 1TB) CPU : amd or intel? what series/models would you guys recommend? MEM : looking for ECC ram as the main focus will be data storage. but how much memory will I need for zfs (assuming I will fill up the whole case with 18 HDDs down the road)? GPU : a gpu capable of driving maybe a LG DualUp 2560 x 2880 with a 34\" 1440p 3440×1440 ultrawide monitor. I will also be doing some photo editing with darktable, rawtherapee, etc. as well so a designated gpu that is good enough should be enough. (don't think there will be much gaming). PSU : how big of a power supply? keep in mind the full capacity is 18 HDD, with dual monitor, etc. CPU COOLER : HDD : thinking of 18 or 20TB seagate exos (are they too loud to use in the bedroom in a personal desktop? should i go for ironwolf pro?)"},

Feel free to lmk if you think there's a better place to post this. I'm trying to archive the different versions of Disney movies that have regional differences. For example, I have the different versions of Inside Out where Riley hates either broccoli (US) or green bell peppers (Japan). Most movies only have a few variations, but Cars 2 and Planes each has about 7 variations each where the design of a car or a plane changes depending on the region. I've gotten nearly all of them, and almost all the variations of all the other movies, except for three: Chinese Zootopia (secondary newscaster is a panda) Russian Cars 2 (Car is styled as the Russian flag) Russian Planes (the \"sexy\" girl plane is styled after the Russian flag) You can probably see why I'm having trouble with these. Disney+ isn't offered in those countries for geopolitical reasons. I've scoured the internet that is available to me looking for ways to source these either physically or digitally, but even my non-public sources are not very interested in this kind of thing.

{"Title": "Advice/Recommendation on a Personal Desktop Build with a focus on Data Storage that can also be used as a small homeserver for myself.", "Author": "u/curiousdoggo", "Content": "Goal: I know people typically separate their data storage/server/nas from their personal desktop so it can be left to do its designated tasks and so that it won't affect the performance of the desktop (if it has to serve a multitude of people or perform a lot of different tasks), but what if my server/nas needs are minimal and my primary focus is just a good personal desktop with a focus on datahoarding/data storage, some file sharing, running a few VMs, and possibly a few more server features? In this case, is it okay to just build a decently powerful modern personal desktop - killing 2 birds with 1 s tone, instead of building 2 computers, one for desktop (desperately need the upgrade now) and one specifically for a server/nas? Is this totally okay? I live by myself so aside from being a personal computer with data storage, it'll just be serving me alone at home. To be honest, at the moment, I pretty much just consume media on my desktop, so even nas/media server features like plex, jellyfins aren't even 100% necessary - though nice to have perhaps in the future. Summary : Decently powerful personal desktop with a focus on datahoarding/data storage that can also perform some server side of things like running VMs, and other homelab things down the road. OS : FreeBSD with ZFS + ECC Memory CASE : thinking of a big case like Fractal Design Define 7 XL that is capable of holding 14-18 HDDs. MOBO : SSD : What's a good NVMe 2.0 ?(maybe 1TB) CPU : amd or intel? what series/models would you guys recommend? MEM : looking for ECC ram as the main focus will be data storage. but how much memory will I need for zfs (assuming I will fill up the whole case with 18 HDDs down the road)? GPU : a gpu capable of driving maybe a LG DualUp 2560 x 2880 with a 34\" 1440p 3440×1440 ultrawide monitor. I will also be doing some photo editing with darktable, rawtherapee, etc. as well so a designated gpu that is good enough should be enough. (don't think there will be much gaming). PSU : how big of a power supply? keep in mind the full capacity is 18 HDD, with dual monitor, etc. CPU COOLER : HDD : thinking of 18 or 20TB seagate exos (are they too loud to use in the bedroom in a personal desktop? should i go for ironwolf pro?)"},

For example, I have the different versions of Inside Out where Riley hates either broccoli (US) or green bell peppers (Japan). Most movies only have a few variations, but Cars 2 and Planes each has about 7 variations each where the design of a car or a plane changes depending on the region. I've gotten nearly all of them, and almost all the variations of all the other movies, except for three: Chinese Zootopia (secondary newscaster is a panda) Russian Cars 2 (Car is styled as the Russian flag) Russian Planes (the \"sexy\" girl plane is styled after the Russian flag) You can probably see why I'm having trouble with these. Disney+ isn't offered in those countries for geopolitical reasons. I've scoured the internet that is available to me looking for ways to source these either physically or digitally, but even my non-public sources are not very interested in this kind of thing.

After discussion in another thread, I've decided to not go with Windows OS on the server and instead run a Linux based OS so some sort. My hardware is a i5-9500 with 8gb or ram. In terms of storage I have a 256gb m2 NVME, 2x 10tb HDD and a 256g 2.5\" SSD if it is useful in some way. This leaves me with 2 sata3 ports(1 if I use the 2.5\" SSD) and 1 m2 slot available for further expansion of storage. Initial intended uses are to run JellyFin media server, Home Assistant and an image management app for pics, all local. I would like full redundancy via raid1, this is where I'm a bit uncertain on approach. I assume I'll run the OS and any apps on the NVME, not the HDD. Since i have the additional NVME slot available is there benefit to adding a second NVME drive for cache or even a mirror of the OS and apps? Should I be looking to manage my raid with an application of some sort or in the Debian OS itself? If the raid is setup in Debian, how does that affect future expansion?

The drive is originally in exFAT with some warranty content on it. I have Windows 10, so not using badblocks, but have HD Sentinel. My order is this: Minimum: Short Long self-test (which will do an initial READ) Surface WRITE+Read with default 0's Quick format (to NTFS for use) Extensive: Short self-test Quick format (to NTFS, solely for the next step) Filling disk with large files ( using TeraCopy verify+test using H2TestW) Surface READ test Surface WRITE+Read with default 0's Surface WRITE+Read with 1's ( 0xFF) Surface WRITE+Read back with 0's Quick format (to NTFS) Alternatively, badblocks instead of steps 5-7, or full u/ EchoGecko795 routine below in the comments. Thanks to everyone, all questions answered! Some notes: Extended self-test can be skipped, as it just short self-test + READ test sequence within the drive, just less informative than the Surface read test as doesn't consider connectivity performance Full format in Windows isn't needed, as it's the same as Surface READ + WRITE (with 0's) tests, maybe more limited, and quick format is enough just to change the filesystem Different surface write+read patterns emulate the 4-pass badblocks test A few things I wanted to clarify: how redundant is filling the drive with files, considering further WRITE+Read surface test? Does it only serve as another WRITE pass, just with different data? do I really need the Read test before the WRITE+Read test , or is the latter enough? (i.e. can a READ before WRITE indicate something that a READ after WRITE won't?). My idea was to see the initial READ after the drive is filled with files, then overwriting it with 0's and reading again how important is changing the pattern/flipping 0's to 1's? should I flip 1's to 0's back again? Can the 1's pattern remain, following a quick format prior to using the drive? And finally, is the more time-consuming 3-4 pass procedure really worth it, and not an overkill?"},

The drive is originally in exFAT with some warranty content on it. I have Windows 10, so not using badblocks, but have HD Sentinel. My order is this: Minimum: Short Long self-test (which will do an initial READ) Surface WRITE+Read with default 0's Quick format (to NTFS for use) Extensive: Short self-test Quick format (to NTFS, solely for the next step) Filling disk with large files ( using TeraCopy verify+test using H2TestW) Surface READ test Surface WRITE+Read with default 0's Surface WRITE+Read with 1's ( 0xFF) Surface WRITE+Read back with 0's Quick format (to NTFS) Alternatively, badblocks instead of steps 5-7, or full u/ EchoGecko795 routine below in the comments. Thanks to everyone, all questions answered! Some notes: Extended self-test can be skipped, as it just short self-test + READ test sequence within the drive, just less informative than the Surface read test as doesn't consider connectivity performance Full format in Windows isn't needed, as it's the same as Surface READ + WRITE (with 0's) tests, maybe more limited, and quick format is enough just to change the filesystem Different surface write+read patterns emulate the 4-pass badblocks test A few things I wanted to clarify: how redundant is filling the drive with files, considering further WRITE+Read surface test? Does it only serve as another WRITE pass, just with different data? do I really need the Read test before the WRITE+Read test , or is the latter enough? (i.e. can a READ before WRITE indicate something that a READ after WRITE won't?). My idea was to see the initial READ after the drive is filled with files, then overwriting it with 0's and reading again how important is changing the pattern/flipping 0's to 1's? should I flip 1's to 0's back again? Can the 1's pattern remain, following a quick format prior to using the drive? And finally, is the more time-consuming 3-4 pass procedure really worth it, and not an overkill?"},

With the machine powered off, I boot to BIOS, and the disk is found. However, after rebooting, the machine doesn't boot. If I unplug the drive after step 2, the machine boots normally.

After discussion in another thread, I've decided to not go with Windows OS on the server and instead run a Linux based OS so some sort. My hardware is a i5-9500 with 8gb or ram. In terms of storage I have a 256gb m2 NVME, 2x 10tb HDD and a 256g 2.5\" SSD if it is useful in some way. This leaves me with 2 sata3 ports(1 if I use the 2.5\" SSD) and 1 m2 slot available for further expansion of storage. Initial intended uses are to run JellyFin media server, Home Assistant and an image management app for pics, all local. I would like full redundancy via raid1, this is where I'm a bit uncertain on approach. I assume I'll run the OS and any apps on the NVME, not the HDD. Since i have the additional NVME slot available is there benefit to adding a second NVME drive for cache or even a mirror of the OS and apps? Should I be looking to manage my raid with an application of some sort or in the Debian OS itself? If the raid is setup in Debian, how does that affect future expansion? Do i have to add pairs of drives or could I for example just add a 18tb random drive?

The drive is originally in exFAT with some warranty content on it. I have Windows 10, so not using badblocks, but have HD Sentinel. My order is this: Minimum: Short Long self-test (which will do an initial READ) Surface WRITE+Read with default 0's Quick format (to NTFS for use) Extensive: Short self-test Quick format (to NTFS, solely for the next step) Filling disk with large files ( using TeraCopy verify+test using H2TestW) Surface READ test Surface WRITE+Read with default 0's Surface WRITE+Read with 1's ( 0xFF) Surface WRITE+Read back with 0's Quick format (to NTFS) Alternatively, badblocks instead of steps 5-7, or full u/ EchoGecko795 routine below in the comments. Thanks to everyone, all questions answered! Some notes: Extended self-test can be skipped, as it just short self-test + READ test sequence within the drive, just less informative than the Surface read test as doesn't consider connectivity performance Full format in Windows isn't needed, as it's the same as Surface READ + WRITE (with 0's) tests, maybe more limited, and quick format is enough just to change the filesystem Different surface write+read patterns emulate the 4-pass badblocks test A few things I wanted to clarify: how redundant is filling the drive with files, considering further WRITE+Read surface test? Does it only serve as another WRITE pass, just with different data? do I really need the Read test before the WRITE+Read test , or is the latter enough? (i.e. can a READ before WRITE indicate something that a READ after WRITE won't?). My idea was to see the initial READ after the drive is filled with files, then overwriting it with 0's and reading again how important is changing the pattern/flipping 0's to 1's? should I flip 1's to 0's back again? Can the 1's pattern remain, following a quick format prior to using the drive? And finally, is the more time-consuming 3-4 pass procedure really worth it, and not an overkill?"},

It does not store data on the servers - rather, two devices have to be online at the same time for data to be synced. It's been a while so I don't remember the mechanisms through which it operates There are a couple of downsides. First being that wireless syncing is slow, second being that errors are more common with wireless syncing (from my experiences). Imagine a folder and imagine that every day I make a few changes to the files within it. I need the ability to sync all the changes within the folder for 2 devices.

{"Title": "looking for something similar to Qsync", "Author": "u/niloproject", "Content": "Hi everyone, I could use some help. I've put together a NAS for my business and I was wondering if there were any alternatives to Qnap Qsync that would work with Truenas. (I also asked this in the truenas server but figured it would hurt to ask here too). The functionality in specific that I'm looking for is the ability to create users that can then establish a two way sync with the server, but similar to with Qsync, there would ideally be a smart sync that would only download what users actually need locally and not anything that isn't necessary to their work so they're not having to deal with terabytes of storage being synced.  They could then work directly on the mounted drive from their machines and anything they create will be synced to everyone and they won't have to worry about manually downloading/duplicating files on the server. When building this I didn't realize how hard it would be to find a tool for this, and everything I've found just isn't very useful. Syncthing is not helpful, its not smart and would require everyone mirror 20tb of files (unless im misunderstanding what it does.) SMB sharing technically works but is too slow for people to work off of for our purposes as our files have huge datarates (multilayer EXR sequences, 1gb a frame kind of stuff).  I'm also experimenting with Google Workspace to see if that works any better for this but I'd figure I'd ask for help before I go down that road. If any of you have any experience with this or could maybe point me to a client-side software that can manage client side downloads from the server in a smart way like Qsync that would be amazing."},
