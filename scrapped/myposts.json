{"Title": "Loopy, high boyfriend coming off of anesthesia", "Author": "Unknown author", "Content": "My boyfriend (M21) had a very long, very invasive surgery today. He was under strong anesthesia for nearly 4 hours. They finally call and say we can come see him, but warned us he was EXTREMELY high from the anesthesia. I (F19) have been with him for almost a year and a half. We tell each other we love each other multiple times a day every day. I have never doubted he loves me. But today was just a new level. He comes out of the ICU, he doesn’t see me at first, and then the nurse points to me and says “there she is!” He looks at me, begins to cry and reaches his hands out for me like a baby, telling me I was the most beautiful thing he’s ever seen in the whole world, he is so happy to see me, he loves me, he can’t believe I’m his girlfriend, staring at my face, kissing my hands. The nurses told me he couldn’t stop talking about me when he woke up after the surgery. He grabbed my hand the whole way back to his room, and while we are in the room, every single time a nurse came in, he asked them “isn’t she so pretty? This is my girlfriend!! She is so sweet” and I honestly could not keep myself from crying. He was in so much pain, yet he would still grab onto my hand and smile at me from his hospital bed. He would drift off to sleep still holding my hand, then wake up and freak out until I reassured him I was right next to him, and he would just smile so big and adorable and fall back asleep again. I don’t even know if he will remember all of this tomorrow, but I don’t care. I don’t know how I could love this boy even more, but I do. Just wanted to gush. Thanks Reddit"},
{"Title": "My wife is a SAHM and I kicked her out of the house", "Author": "Unknown author", "Content": "I M33 am married to my wife 32f She is a SAHM to three kids. 7,5,3. And I work from home full time and provide for my family. Through my office door, I can hear the kids definitely challenging her today. Just not listening, extra fussy. I left my office, and I can see all over my wife’s face that she is overwhelmed, stressed and tired. Sooo. I called off work, gave her my credit card, we both have bank cards. And a joint account that we both use freely. But for today, I think some serious retail therapy is in order. And I will pay the balance off at the end of the month. So I am the one with the credit card. I gave her kiss a hug and kicked her out of the house. I told her not to come back until she buys something for herself that she truly wants, eats a nice meal, drink a fancy drink, go get a message. Shoot, even book a hotel room for two days just to be by yourself and enjoy peace. Whatever you need to do for your self care, go do it! She gave me a kiss, a hug, didn’t fight me and left in her car. Will she be back? I’m not sure 😅 Now im going to have a clam but firm conversation with our boys. On why they need to respect their mother. And challenge all of them on what we can do around the house to show her how much we love her. Before she gets back home.( if she comes back) You see as a dad, I don’t struggle with kids like she does. Granted I work 9-5 so I am not with them all day. But when I do have days off, or let my wife sleep in while I cook the kids breakfast, or their lunch. I don’t get any back talk, attitudes. What I say goes and that’s it. If the kids are getting in each other’s nerves, I give them a warning and they stop. I don’t yell at them or spank them. If my wife and I are together with the kids. It’s calm and quiet. As soon as I leave let’s say to go to the bathroom, store whatever. All Hell breaks loose. I grew up in a household where my parents were both physically, mentally and emotionally abusive to me. I wanted to kill myself at age five. My parents were both youth  pastors and prayed, encouraged and uplifted everyone at church. But behind closed doors. It was my hell. I survived suicide, alcoholism, depression and anxiety. I had really some serious trauma that I needed to work on. And learn how to love and be kind to myself. Admit my mistakes and confront my shame. Nearly killed me again. But made it out. Barley…. Now 33m I haven’t left my faith in God. And I promised my self once I have kids, I won’t be like my parents. I just feel so sorry for her and the stress she endures. I see her and acknowledge her hardship. I hope she stays out all day today and relaxes. So how can truly bring it home to my children. That they need to respect their mother? EDIT #1: my gosh! My DMs are blowing up so positive and some bad. To the positive ones I am enjoying the conversation and all your advice. As well as sharing my life story with you. And hearing your stories as well! To the bad dms and comments. I am sorry if it came across as me bragging or wanting kudos. This is not the case. I was just telling a story of my day. And legit wanted advice to be a better father. EDIT #2 : some people are hung on the credit card situation. She has her own credit card. We just paid it off and mutually decided together to do all the big spending on mine. Since we are in a one income household. We kept catch ourselves getting into debt and not communicating properly when we made purchases. So 2024 this was our New Year’s resolution we decided to do together when it comes to credit cards EDIT #3 : She did come back. I had a baby sitter on standby to watch the kids at night. And I took her to a nice relaxing restaurant and bought stuff at Ulta"},

He automatically said no, which I expected. I said “I know that’s a tricky question” and he replied “yeah, I don’t appreciate that question.” So I told him “I would really like an honest answer” so he stopped and thought about it. He looked at me and said “since the beginning of this relationship we have both gained a little weight” as he grabbed the tummy of his wonderful dad bod “even now, when we are walking in the store, I look at you and think wow. You are the perfect shape. Exactly what I like. However, if you feel the need to eat healthier I will do it with you. I know I can’t go to the gym with you because one of us has to stay home with our son (3yo), but we can start working on being healthier together.” And this brought me peace and gratitude. I just wanted to say “thank you for being honest with me and validating my feelings about my body. Thank you for flowing love into your words about such a sensitive topic. Thank you for loving me enough to make this effort for me. I really will love you forever.” But I just said “thank you baby, that sounds great.”"},
{"Title": "My girlfriend is sweet to me all the time, even when she’s sleeping", "Author": "Unknown author", "Content": "My girlfriend is a very light sleeper. Somehow even when she’s sleeping, she registers what’s going on in the outside world. I, on the other hand, have sleep problems so I’m usually up later than she is. Some reports: If I kiss her while she’s asleep, she always kisses back. If I tell her I love her while she’s asleep, she says it back. Bonus: if I whisper it, she whispers back too. If I shift around on the bed and get close to her shoulder, she kisses my forehead immediately. If I ask to cuddle, she immediately puts her arms around me and kisses me. Every time, she does this and goes right back to sleep. She’s only conscious for that split second it takes to respond. She has no memory of this in the morning. It makes me feel so special and safe."},
{"Title": "I couldn’t reach my boyfriend for a while tonight and called him 15+ times before he answered. He was just sleeping. His reaction melted me.", "Author": "u/ams712", "Content": "Backstory: I am diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder. So yes, I have a problem, and I am actively working on it through medications and therapy. My boyfriend always calls me before he goes to sleep. If for some reason he falls asleep without calling, which is very rare, I call him before I go to sleep which has always woken him up. (We only sleep apart from each other once a week). Tonight for about an hour I couldn’t get a hold of him. Thinking back on it, rationally I should have realized he was probably deeply sleeping as he didn’t get much sleep the night before. But my anxiety convinced me he was dead somewhere. So my call finally woke him up and I just was a sobbing, blubbering mess. He didn’t once berate me, make excuses, or make me feel stupid. He just apologized (he had nothing to apologize for) and reassured me. I told him i felt crazy. He said that is not true. He told me that my anxiety is part of me and he loves all of me, even the anxiety. I’ve never felt so reassured and safe. This man understands everything about me, even the parts I don’t truly understand fully. He understands my anxiety without ever having experienced it himself. He amazes me every day."},

She was wearing dark leggings that clung to her legs tightly and a very cute, fuzzy pink sweater that she'd just gotten for Christmas. Then, out of the blue in between words of our conversation, she leaned forward and gave me a kiss. Just a quick touching of our lips, then she leaned back upright, watching me silently with her big, beautiful blue eyes, like she was nervous about how I would react. I couldn’t stop smiling. I leaned forward and gave her a hug and a kiss on the head, stroking her hair and telling her how sweet she was and how soft her lips were. That was my first kiss, and hers too, and it felt wonderful. She said that it had taken a lot of courage for her to do that, but that she was glad she did. With me, of all people! At the end of the date, we kissed twice more in her driveway before I got in the car. Another quick kiss and one slightly longer one."},

I walked up to him and gave him a small peck on the cheek, nothing extravagant. When I moved back to look at him, he had the biggest smile on his face and was blushing a little bit. I literally melted when I saw how something so small could make him so happy. Ughh I love him sooooo much. He told he he loves little kisses like that and they make him all warm and fuzzy on the inside. I keep falling more and more I love with him everyday we’re together. I love you my muffin❤️😘"},

I’m 25 years old and I’ve never felt the way about a partner that I feel about him, my whole body and mind craves him and he feels the same way about me. I feel like I’ve won guys The best part about all of this is that he is extremely emotionally ready to be with me for the rest of our lives, we will be getting married and he is so devoted to me the same way I am to him. We communicate so efficiently and in the year we’ve been together it’s just getting better and better. I was truly lost and I never thought I would find a love like this until I met him.

{"Title": "So, I looked through my Partner’s phone. Here’s what I found:", "Author": "u/ithinkyoushouldlurk", "Content": "Tbf, we use each other’s phones all the time for googling stuff, looking up directions, etc., so we’re already in each other’s phones fairly frequently. We were friends for years before dating, so we naturally have 0 secrets from each other. I have some attachment / trust wounds from a previous (abusive) relationship and he is so patient with me. If I ever get in my head and start to worry, I can always sheepishly ask to peek through his phone. This doesn’t happen often, but it happened this past week. So, I asked him to look through it and here’s what I found: 5 photo albums. Named: ‘My girlfriend is a Baddie 🥵’ ‘Life with the love of my life’ ‘For C’s playlist’ ‘For C’s photo album’ ‘Presents for C’ 4+ lists in his Notes app of gift ideas for me 10+ lists of thoughtful things to do for me while I’m out of town Anyway. Just wanted to share how ridiculously wholesome my bf is. Been together going on 3 years and he’s just everything good in the world. 🥹 EDIT: WOW I did not expect all the love on this, thank you beautiful people so much! your kind comments and other amazing stories brightened my day. BF and I had a good chuckle reading thru the few “you’re toxic and pathetic” and “he’s still hiding something, you just don’t know it” comments lol. I am truly sorry some of y’all have been hurt so badly. it’s wonderful having a partner who loves and understands you even when you’re not at your best, and wants to give you all the love and reassurance in the world because they care about you and have nothing to hide. I truly wish that for all the sad people commenting their own projections and misgivings 💕 oh and PS, of course I didn’t peek into any of the gift ideas. I’m not a monster 👹😉"},

{"Title": "Today I learned grief is the toll we pay for love.", "Author": "u/Godspeed411", "Content": "I sit here in tears today grieving the end of my 8 year relationship. We met as strangers on the internet. We had our first FaceTime just a day after exchanging emails. I’ll never forget it. We are just 5 years apart in age. 8 months later we signed a lease on our first apartment together. It was nicer than anything either of us had ever stayed in. It was our home. We texted everyday “I love you” and “I love you more”. It was unlike any relationship I had ever had. It felt safe, and l felt loved. Sure we have our arguments but it tore us both apart to not be connected. The arguing would end in “I’m sorry” and “I hate being apart from you”. The pandemic hit and while many couples hated being locked up together, we found ways to have fun. We would shoot nerf guns at red solo cups we setup as targets. We started saving to buy a house. Then one day I got a message through Facebook from someone who said I was being cheated on. Sure enough it was true. My heart broke. I decided to forgive and we moved on. We got engaged, we bought our first house and took the in laws to Italy. Life was good but I had trust issues which then affected our sex life. We went to therapy but we still argued. And then late in 2023 I get a text from another person letting me know I’ve been cheated on. It was true. That’s when I ended it. Of course I’m leaving so many details out because I don’t want this to be a longer post than it already is but I want to say this to all of you looking for love… love with your whole heart. Love deep. Love is a risk and if I had the choice to do this all over again knowing how it would end, I would. But I’d still leave. True vulnerable love is the most beautiful and fullfilling feeling you can have. don’t take any moment for granted. Looking back, I did. I assumed that we’d always have each other and I regret focusing on work so much. no one is perfect. Own up to how you played a part in any arguments. Remember why you love each other. And I’ll leave you with this…you’ll know if you truly loved because in the end (whether death or breakup) you’ll have to pay the toll and it’s grief. And it’s deep deep grief but it’s so worth it. Edit: to everyone telling me to get therapy, just stop. My post isn’t about asking for your help. Everyone’s journey is different and I alone made a very conscious choice to remain in my relationship. I’m not blaming anyone for my choices. That’s what being an adult is. My post left out many details for brevity sake so I’ll mention here that the heavy grief is being felt on both sides. We hold each other and cry so hard some nights. Yes we still live together. I move this week."},

Earlier today he mentioned that he's at peace when he's near me. And for some reason I couldn't figure out why that perplexed me. Well just a few minutes ago I remembered when we first met. I remember when he hugged me. To comfort me. He said he was at peace and that his soul felt drawn to me even though we had just met. I have tears rolling down my face now.  I read that that feeling can be described as \"coming home\". Because that means whatever he had been searching for he found in me. And whenever he drifts off he searches for me subconsciously.

She didn’t even ask what happened the only thing she said to me was that she knew and that she was there for me Through a clenched throat and gutted tears my mom told me that above even my dad that she felt like I was her soulmate. She told me that she felt like she waited her entire life for me to come to her and that no one else she’s ever been close to has had such a connection to her that she’s had with me This obviously made me immediately start to cry and i told her I felt the exact same way and that I feel like we had probably been through multiple lives together  while hugged and both had tears running down our face. I don’t know, I know it feels probably dry to type this out but I didn’t  know where to share it. Lucky me that my mom said this to me but I just feel like it goes to show, you dont always have to meet the “right person” to find this kind of love and connection. Sometimes, they’re right there next you in your family. This being said, going into the new year I feel so incredibly lucky to be alive and to have felt something like this in my life. I hope anyone who reads this feels loved and knows that they really are the center of someone’s universe and that there’s no definition of what a soulmate should look like. If you love someone tell them, and make that a priority in your life no matter who it is, there’s too much hatred that exists out there otherwise.

We've been friends since 20. We hang out most often and have sleepovers. She's kinda socially awkward and we're each other's best friend. We watch movies together, have drinks, beer mostly and share everything with each other, fight occasionally too. Even our parents mistook us for a couple, but we never imagined it in our wildest dreams. All these times we never had any feelings to each other, at least that's what I thought and we have not dated anyone else. A year ago unexpectedly we started sleeping together, we became FWB. People say its really bad to be FWB with your best friend but in our case it dint ruin our friendship or made anything weird. Actually we sleep together and for us it was very casual, like playing a video game together. And last month things took a turn. I went to her apartment (she's hardly 2 kilometers away) to hangout as usual and she seemed upset. She was pregnant! She cried to me, apologized but I tried to be a supportive friend. I dint blame her or anything cuz it's my responsibility too. Although I acted brave with her I've never slept a wink till yesterday. Thought of having a kid terrified me (she was too). We haven't told our mum and dad yet but we're telling them tomorrow. To the incident of today, for the last month I have been contemplating on my life till that time, about why I'm still single, why we've been sleeping together etc. At some point at night, I imagined a situation some guy marries a girl he made pregnant and suddenly I don't know why I replaced those people with us. That moment, I thought about how my life would be if we were a couple. I felt a little joy inside. I think that's how everyone feels about a person the love. I thought about all of our interactions for the last few years and it hit me hard why others took us for a couple. I was startled and felt awkward when I realised I have feelings for my best friend. I was really tensed, we're both strangers to romance and I was terribly scared to tell her. Some thing happened an hour ago, following and someone on reddit, I talked to her, mustering all the courage I can. I thought she will freak out and we never speak to each other again. But she wept, hugging me. She couldn't even speak properly when she said she loved me all this time, for years. I couldn't stop shedding some tears too even though I tried to look tough. She told me she was scared sick I might reject her. Said she always dropped hints.(I swear dint even realise it.) When I told her she said, \"You son of a b**ch I've been loving you for over six years\"!. I could not not drop my jaw. Anyway we promised to raise the kid together and make our relationship official and go on a date tomorrow evening. We don't know shit about dating but we are very optimistic about our future. I don't know if there will be a marriage in the future but we sure see us together. Edit: someone told me to asked her to write her side of the story. She agreed to post it soon"},

Please!\" So I said \"But it's me\" she said \"No!\" I got nervous and asked for a name and she said my complete full name. She then realized it was me and hugged me as tight as she could.

It took about 15 minutes for me to get the food, but when I came out she said “I knew they were going to make you wait!” I think I just laughed and walked away. Idk. Then she calls out to me and says “hey, would a hug make you feel better” I was fine so I’m not sure what she meant but I told her she could if she wanted to. Then we hugged and before she walked away, she gave me a kiss on the neck and said something about getting more tips. Now this wasn’t like a sloppy love making kiss, it was more like a quick peck. But it literally didn’t make sense what happened. I’m not good looking, I’m not fit, I don’t stand out. Only thing I can think of is that maybe she was drunk. But it was the middle of the day so I’m not sure. All I know is that I was BRICKED for the next half hour, also that it made me feel like someone wanted me. I was stressing over some shit that happened earlier and that just blew everything away. I know this reads as a “and then every one clapped” story but I don’t care.

I’ve been afraid he would leave me with everything going on. We closed on our house on Wednesday, and due to a clerical error his name got left off all the documents. We have to go back in six weeks and pay a 200 dollar fee to add his name to the house. He could leave me at anytime because currently, he’s free and clear. I’m the only one stuck. We don’t have any furniture yet. We have been sleeping on the floor. It hurts his back and he’s been saying how uncomfortable sleeping on the floor is. So. ....We borrowed an air mattress from a friend. It’s SMOL. I’m used to sleeping on the floor. I lived in my car for a year. It’s not the most comfortable. But I can tolerate it pretty well. I let him sleep on the air mattress last night because I wanted him to be comfortable. Or bed is supposed to get delivered Monday. This morning, I woke up with him next to me on the floor. Snuggled up against my back. He said he couldn’t wait until Monday to sleep next to me. He slept on the floor just to cuddle me.  I’m full of doubts and insecurities but he always seems to make them better. I cried this morning when he said that. We may be going through an extremely stressful time right now but I love him and he loves me. I slept on the floor so he could be comfortable. He slept on the floor because he wasn’t comfortable without me. We both slept on the floor last night."},

{"Title": "My first date with a shy guy 🥰❤️", "Author": "u/LittlePineTrees", "Content": "Hi everyone! Ugh I’m still gushing over the date I had with my shy friend earlier today. We’re both 20F and 20M Some backstory, I’ve known him since around February. I met him in one of my classes and I could instantly tell he was shy/introverted/a little awkward which didn’t bother me. I started talking to him originally about the class and the worksheets we had but then it switched to different things like some things we enjoy. Well since about the beginning of may, I started to catch feelings for him. I know it’s taken him that long to open up by I feel like that’s a big part of my initial crush for him. I’ve seen him open up to me from hiding in his shell all the time to coming out and showing me his true self. I feel so special knowing I’m one of the only people on this planet who can see who this shy, sweet, intelligent guy really is. It was around that time that I started to realize what a hidden gem I had discovered. So a couple months go by, my crush seemingly getting bigger with each passing day. Until I finally decided to just go and ask him out on a date. Nothing special or fancy, it was just us two at Dave and busters. Even his reaction was adorable! When I asked him, his cheeks flushed red and he had a smile on that he couldn’t wipe off. Everything went amazingly well during the date! I dressed in a nice pair of jeans and a nice shirt which got another cute reaction out of him. He blushed when he saw me and was a little speechless because he’d never seen me dressed up. We got some food to eat and we played a bunch of games throughout the store until we headed back home. I held his hand as we walked back to the valet. Again he blushed, smiled, and gave my hand a little squeeze. I seriously can’t get enough of his reactions to doing little things like when I kissed him goodbye, It was like a computer resetting with tons of blushing cheeks🥰. He actually told me I was special to him because of the date and also the fact that I was the only person who decided to stick around and watch him come out of his shell and open up to someone. He likes that I’d invite him to go eat somewhere or hangout after class made a difference to him which is why around mid-April he started having feelings for me too. Ugh I seriously can’t get enough of that boy and how the smallest sign of affection will make him all happy and blush. It makes me feel special too because my previous partners wouldn’t care for those little acts of affection where it makes his week if I kiss him. 🥰🥰 I’m just so happy right now 😊"},

We hadn't seen each other in a couple days but had been fighting mainly over the phone, and the next time we saw each other it was with a group of people, so we didn't really get a chance to air it out in person until later that night. When we were finally alone and he got into my bedroom, I sighed and closed the door, ready to hash it out with him. Really give him a piece of my mind, yknow? I took off my jacket though and he just stared at me and my cute outfit, took off his glasses, then came up and kissed me so passionately I nearly melted into the floor. He basically told me he was sorry but he couldn't stop himself because I looked so good and he loved and missed me. Guys. Guys. Honestly despite rehearsing what I was going to say to him beforehand, I completely forgot my whole speech. I completely forgot what the dumb fight was even about. Hell I'm pretty sure for a while there, I completely forgot my own name. I think I blacked out for a bit because my heart was beating so fast. I felt like freaking anastasia steele when she was kissed in that elevator (fifty shades is a terrible movie but that scene was hot af). And because we don't really like having sex without fixing our issues, we managed to keep our hands off eachother for long enough to laugh about what a stupid fight we were having and to really discuss it all. He triple checked with me that I was okay with everything before proceeding to blow my mind again...if you know what I mean.

He said he was falling out of love with me, and he doesn't think he'll ever be in the same mental state to love me again. I asked if he was willing to go to couples therapy or therapy in general. He doesn't think anything will help. To be honest, there were signs. He became distant. We would still have good chats, but he rarely initiated physical intimacy (hugs, kisses). He would rarely initiate sex either. He told me, at one point, he was trying to avoid me. It hurts. It hurts being the person who still has so much love to work and fight for the relationship, but not getting any of that back. It hurts not being able to grow old with him, to grow with him, to face any challenges with him. It hurts watching him pull away, and me playing it off as tiredness. I hate feeling this way. It feels like a rug was pulled under me. It's hard to fight back the tears. ETA: Thank you for your support and kind comments.

And I work from home full time and provide for my family. Through my office door, I can hear the kids definitely challenging her today. Just not listening, extra fussy. I left my office, and I can see all over my wife’s face that she is overwhelmed, stressed and tired. Sooo. I called off work, gave her my credit card, we both have bank cards. And a joint account that we both use freely. But for today, I think some serious retail therapy is in order. And I will pay the balance off at the end of the month. So I am the one with the credit card. I gave her kiss a hug and kicked her out of the house. I told her not to come back until she buys something for herself that she truly wants, eats a nice meal, drink a fancy drink, go get a message. Shoot, even book a hotel room for two days just to be by yourself and enjoy peace. Whatever you need to do for your self care, go do it! She gave me a kiss, a hug, didn’t fight me and left in her car. Will she be back? I’m not sure 😅 Now im going to have a clam but firm conversation with our boys. On why they need to respect their mother. And challenge all of them on what we can do around the house to show her how much we love her. Before she gets back home.( if she comes back) You see as a dad, I don’t struggle with kids like she does. Granted I work 9-5 so I am not with them all day. But when I do have days off, or let my wife sleep in while I cook the kids breakfast, or their lunch. I don’t get any back talk, attitudes. What I say goes and that’s it. If the kids are getting in each other’s nerves, I give them a warning and they stop. I don’t yell at them or spank them. If my wife and I are together with the kids. It’s calm and quiet. As soon as I leave let’s say to go to the bathroom, store whatever. All Hell breaks loose. I grew up in a household where my parents were both physically, mentally and emotionally abusive to me. I wanted to kill myself at age five. My parents were both youth  pastors and prayed, encouraged and uplifted everyone at church. But behind closed doors. It was my hell. I survived suicide, alcoholism, depression and anxiety. I had really some serious trauma that I needed to work on. And learn how to love and be kind to myself. Admit my mistakes and confront my shame. Nearly killed me again. But made it out. Barley…. Now 33m I haven’t left my faith in God. And I promised my self once I have kids, I won’t be like my parents. I just feel so sorry for her and the stress she endures. I see her and acknowledge her hardship. I hope she stays out all day today and relaxes. So how can truly bring it home to my children. That they need to respect their mother? EDIT #1: my gosh! My DMs are blowing up so positive and some bad. To the positive ones I am enjoying the conversation and all your advice. As well as sharing my life story with you. And hearing your stories as well! To the bad dms and comments. I am sorry if it came across as me bragging or wanting kudos. This is not the case. I was just telling a story of my day. And legit wanted advice to be a better father. EDIT #2 : some people are hung on the credit card situation. She has her own credit card. We just paid it off and mutually decided together to do all the big spending on mine. Since we are in a one income household. We kept catch ourselves getting into debt and not communicating properly when we made purchases. So 2024 this was our New Year’s resolution we decided to do together when it comes to credit cards EDIT #3 : She did come back. I had a baby sitter on standby to watch the kids at night.

You are the perfect shape. Exactly what I like. However, if you feel the need to eat healthier I will do it with you. I know I can’t go to the gym with you because one of us has to stay home with our son (3yo), but we can start working on being healthier together.” And this brought me peace and gratitude. I just wanted to say “thank you for being honest with me and validating my feelings about my body. Thank you for flowing love into your words about such a sensitive topic. Thank you for loving me enough to make this effort for me. I really will love you forever.” But I just said “thank you baby, that sounds great.”"},

Somehow even when she’s sleeping, she registers what’s going on in the outside world. I, on the other hand, have sleep problems so I’m usually up later than she is. Some reports: If I kiss her while she’s asleep, she always kisses back. If I tell her I love her while she’s asleep, she says it back. Bonus: if I whisper it, she whispers back too. If I shift around on the bed and get close to her shoulder, she kisses my forehead immediately. If I ask to cuddle, she immediately puts her arms around me and kisses me. Every time, she does this and goes right back to sleep. She’s only conscious for that split second it takes to respond. She has no memory of this in the morning. It makes me feel so special and safe."},

So yes, I have a problem, and I am actively working on it through medications and therapy. My boyfriend always calls me before he goes to sleep. If for some reason he falls asleep without calling, which is very rare, I call him before I go to sleep which has always woken him up. (We only sleep apart from each other once a week). Tonight for about an hour I couldn’t get a hold of him. Thinking back on it, rationally I should have realized he was probably deeply sleeping as he didn’t get much sleep the night before. But my anxiety convinced me he was dead somewhere. So my call finally woke him up and I just was a sobbing, blubbering mess. He didn’t once berate me, make excuses, or make me feel stupid. He just apologized (he had nothing to apologize for) and reassured me. I told him i felt crazy. He said that is not true. He told me that my anxiety is part of me and he loves all of me, even the anxiety. I’ve never felt so reassured and safe. This man understands everything about me, even the parts I don’t truly understand fully. He understands my anxiety without ever having experienced it himself. He amazes me every day."},

I leaned forward and gave her a hug and a kiss on the head, stroking her hair and telling her how sweet she was and how soft her lips were. That was my first kiss, and hers too, and it felt wonderful. She said that it had taken a lot of courage for her to do that, but that she was glad she did. With me, of all people!

If I ever get in my head and start to worry, I can always sheepishly ask to peek through his phone. This doesn’t happen often, but it happened this past week. So, I asked him to look through it and here’s what I found: 5 photo albums.

I am truly sorry some of y’all have been hurt so badly. it’s wonderful having a partner who loves and understands you even when you’re not at your best, and wants to give you all the love and reassurance in the world because they care about you and have nothing to hide.

{"Title": "Today I learned grief is the toll we pay for love.", "Author": "u/Godspeed411", "Content": "I sit here in tears today grieving the end of my 8 year relationship. We met as strangers on the internet. We had our first FaceTime just a day after exchanging emails. I’ll never forget it. We are just 5 years apart in age. 8 months later we signed a lease on our first apartment together. It was nicer than anything either of us had ever stayed in. It was our home. We texted everyday “I love you” and “I love you more”. It was unlike any relationship I had ever had. It felt safe, and l felt loved. Sure we have our arguments but it tore us both apart to not be connected. The arguing would end in “I’m sorry” and “I hate being apart from you”. The pandemic hit and while many couples hated being locked up together, we found ways to have fun. We would shoot nerf guns at red solo cups we setup as targets. We started saving to buy a house. Then one day I got a message through Facebook from someone who said I was being cheated on. Sure enough it was true. My heart broke. I decided to forgive and we moved on. We got engaged, we bought our first house and took the in laws to Italy. Life was good but I had trust issues which then affected our sex life. We went to therapy but we still argued. And then late in 2023 I get a text from another person letting me know I’ve been cheated on. It was true. That’s when I ended it. Of course I’m leaving so many details out because I don’t want this to be a longer post than it already is but I want to say this to all of you looking for love… love with your whole heart. Love deep. Love is a risk and if I had the choice to do this all over again knowing how it would end, I would. But I’d still leave. True vulnerable love is the most beautiful and fullfilling feeling you can have. don’t take any moment for granted. Looking back, I did. I assumed that we’d always have each other and I regret focusing on work so much. no one is perfect. Own up to how you played a part in any arguments. Remember why you love each other. And I’ll leave you with this…you’ll know if you truly loved because in the end (whether death or breakup) you’ll have to pay the toll and it’s grief. And it’s deep deep grief but it’s so worth it. Edit: to everyone telling me to get therapy, just stop. My post isn’t about asking for your help. Everyone’s journey is different and I alone made a very conscious choice to remain in my relationship. I’m not blaming anyone for my choices. That’s what being an adult is. My post left out many details for brevity sake so I’ll mention here that the heavy grief is being felt on both sides. We hold each other and cry so hard some nights. Yes we still live together.

I remember when he hugged me. To comfort me. He said he was at peace and that his soul felt drawn to me even though we had just met. I have tears rolling down my face now.

She told me that she felt like she waited her entire life for me to come to her and that no one else she’s ever been close to has had such a connection to her that she’s had with me This obviously made me immediately start to cry and i told her I felt the exact same way and that I feel like we had probably been through multiple lives together  while hugged and both had tears running down our face. I don’t know, I know it feels probably dry to type this out but I didn’t  know where to share it.

We've been friends since 20. We hang out most often and have sleepovers. She's kinda socially awkward and we're each other's best friend. We watch movies together, have drinks, beer mostly and share everything with each other, fight occasionally too. Even our parents mistook us for a couple, but we never imagined it in our wildest dreams. All these times we never had any feelings to each other, at least that's what I thought and we have not dated anyone else. A year ago unexpectedly we started sleeping together, we became FWB. People say its really bad to be FWB with your best friend but in our case it dint ruin our friendship or made anything weird. Actually we sleep together and for us it was very casual, like playing a video game together. And last month things took a turn. I went to her apartment (she's hardly 2 kilometers away) to hangout as usual and she seemed upset. She was pregnant! She cried to me, apologized but I tried to be a supportive friend. I dint blame her or anything cuz it's my responsibility too. Although I acted brave with her I've never slept a wink till yesterday. Thought of having a kid terrified me (she was too). We haven't told our mum and dad yet but we're telling them tomorrow. To the incident of today, for the last month I have been contemplating on my life till that time, about why I'm still single, why we've been sleeping together etc. At some point at night, I imagined a situation some guy marries a girl he made pregnant and suddenly I don't know why I replaced those people with us. That moment, I thought about how my life would be if we were a couple. I felt a little joy inside. I think that's how everyone feels about a person the love. I thought about all of our interactions for the last few years and it hit me hard why others took us for a couple. I was startled and felt awkward when I realised I have feelings for my best friend. I was really tensed, we're both strangers to romance and I was terribly scared to tell her. Some thing happened an hour ago, following and someone on reddit, I talked to her, mustering all the courage I can. I thought she will freak out and we never speak to each other again. But she wept, hugging me. She couldn't even speak properly when she said she loved me all this time, for years. I couldn't stop shedding some tears too even though I tried to look tough. She told me she was scared sick I might reject her. Said she always dropped hints.(I swear dint even realise it.) When I told her she said, \"You son of a b**ch I've been loving you for over six years\"!. I could not not drop my jaw. Anyway we promised to raise the kid together and make our relationship official and go on a date tomorrow evening. We don't know shit about dating but we are very optimistic about our future.

He knows my music taste so well, that he can hear if I don't like a song and he will come in and change it for me. He always gets it right too. It's the little things lady's, stop settling. Not to mention he always knows that \"I don't want any food\" means \"order me something anyway because I will change my mind\" what more can you ask for Edit: because it is apparently not obvious, this is just a joke 🙃 if your man doesn’t do this it doesn’t mean you’re “settling”"},

I've always loved him but lately I feel like I'm just head over heels for him like when we were younger. My stomach gets butterflies and I almost feel sick just from thinking about him, like the jitters you get before you meet up with a new boyfriend. When we are in a room together I can feel the electricity between us almost like a magnet just pulling us together. During Thanksgiving I couldn't help looking at him from across the room and doing little things to catch his attention. I think he feels it too, as he's been very vocal about wanting me and any chance he gets he'll come up and touch me or kiss me. He's always been more affectionate than me but lately it's been taken up several notches. I've caught him several times staring at me, checking me out, and looking love struck. Complimenting and asking why I'm moving a certain way and why I'm teasing him when to me I'm just going about doing my normal chores. I don't know what's going on with us but I hope this feeling stays."},

A little backstory- I told her I have aspirations to join the navy, and when I do, I'll be away for a while, and then after seeing her for a little bit after Bootcamp, I'll be on active duty for 4 years and will only see her every now and again when she comes out to visit or I go home on saved up leave. As she spoke through the tears, she said she didn't want me to go and that she loved me so much. I just held her for what seemed like forever and I just rocked her back and forth on my lap for over an hour as she cried and I consoled her. I loved this girl more than anything. We just cuddled until her sobs turned into smiles and I told her I was going to marry her someday (we have talked about this before) she just smiled and hugged me. And Jesus, you best believe me when I tell you this girl is the most stunning thing you could ever see. She looks so cute and innocent when she weeps, I just have an urge to comfort her."},

{"Title": "My first date with a shy guy 🥰❤️", "Author": "u/LittlePineTrees", "Content": "Hi everyone! Ugh I’m still gushing over the date I had with my shy friend earlier today. We’re both 20F and 20M Some backstory, I’ve known him since around February. I met him in one of my classes and I could instantly tell he was shy/introverted/a little awkward which didn’t bother me. I started talking to him originally about the class and the worksheets we had but then it switched to different things like some things we enjoy. Well since about the beginning of may, I started to catch feelings for him. I know it’s taken him that long to open up by I feel like that’s a big part of my initial crush for him. I’ve seen him open up to me from hiding in his shell all the time to coming out and showing me his true self. I feel so special knowing I’m one of the only people on this planet who can see who this shy, sweet, intelligent guy really is. It was around that time that I started to realize what a hidden gem I had discovered. So a couple months go by, my crush seemingly getting bigger with each passing day. Until I finally decided to just go and ask him out on a date. Nothing special or fancy, it was just us two at Dave and busters. Even his reaction was adorable! When I asked him, his cheeks flushed red and he had a smile on that he couldn’t wipe off. Everything went amazingly well during the date! I dressed in a nice pair of jeans and a nice shirt which got another cute reaction out of him. He blushed when he saw me and was a little speechless because he’d never seen me dressed up. We got some food to eat and we played a bunch of games throughout the store until we headed back home. I held his hand as we walked back to the valet. Again he blushed, smiled, and gave my hand a little squeeze. I seriously can’t get enough of his reactions to doing little things like when I kissed him goodbye, It was like a computer resetting with tons of blushing cheeks🥰. He actually told me I was special to him because of the date and also the fact that I was the only person who decided to stick around and watch him come out of his shell and open up to someone. He likes that I’d invite him to go eat somewhere or hangout after class made a difference to him which is why around mid-April he started having feelings for me too. Ugh I seriously can’t get enough of that boy and how the smallest sign of affection will make him all happy and blush. It makes me feel special too because my previous partners wouldn’t care for those little acts of affection where it makes his week if I kiss him. 🥰🥰 I’m just so happy right now 😊"},

We hadn't seen each other in a couple days but had been fighting mainly over the phone, and the next time we saw each other it was with a group of people, so we didn't really get a chance to air it out in person until later that night. When we were finally alone and he got into my bedroom, I sighed and closed the door, ready to hash it out with him. Really give him a piece of my mind, yknow? I took off my jacket though and he just stared at me and my cute outfit, took off his glasses, then came up and kissed me so passionately I nearly melted into the floor. He basically told me he was sorry but he couldn't stop himself because I looked so good and he loved and missed me. Guys. Guys. Honestly despite rehearsing what I was going to say to him beforehand, I completely forgot my whole speech. I completely forgot what the dumb fight was even about. Hell I'm pretty sure for a while there, I completely forgot my own name. I think I blacked out for a bit because my heart was beating so fast. I felt like freaking anastasia steele when she was kissed in that elevator (fifty shades is a terrible movie but that scene was hot af). And because we don't really like having sex without fixing our issues, we managed to keep our hands off eachother for long enough to laugh about what a stupid fight we were having and to really discuss it all. He triple checked with me that I was okay with everything before proceeding to blow my mind again...if you know what I mean. Can't believe how lucky I am that we're this in love after being together for 7 years.  :)"},

He said he was falling out of love with me, and he doesn't think he'll ever be in the same mental state to love me again. I asked if he was willing to go to couples therapy or therapy in general. He doesn't think anything will help. To be honest, there were signs. He became distant. We would still have good chats, but he rarely initiated physical intimacy (hugs, kisses). He would rarely initiate sex either. He told me, at one point, he was trying to avoid me. It hurts. It hurts being the person who still has so much love to work and fight for the relationship, but not getting any of that back. It hurts not being able to grow old with him, to grow with him, to face any challenges with him. It hurts watching him pull away, and me playing it off as tiredness. I hate feeling this way. It feels like a rug was pulled under me. It's hard to fight back the tears. ETA: Thank you for your support and kind comments. I've read through all of your responses and am glad to see I'm not the only one going through this. I never expected us to go through this journey, from strangers to lovers to strangers again. He says he doesn't see a future with me, and I still don't understand how this suddenly happened. I wish I could say I hate him, but I don't. I love him and I want him to be happy. Despite all of this, he still deserves the world. I wish I could be part of his happiness because I would have done anything to stand by him. ETA2: Wow.

He didn’t touch me. He didn’t cuddle me or hold my hand. I counted once and he kissed me twice in one month. He rarely told me he loved me. We went on dates maybe once every few months, and he’d complain the whole time. Begging for the absolute bare minimum for years from the person who claims to be in love with you does horrible things to your self esteem, and I didn’t even realize it until I got out of it.

My ex never wanted to hold my hand, but I never get in a car with this man wherein he doesn’t hold my hand. I get told I’m pretty constantly. My ex used to complain about going to dinner or the movies; this man has asked to take me into the city for dinner and a symphony, to have sex with me on a hotel balcony overlooking the beach, to take me out to California to show me things he saw on his visit years ago. I get good morning texts. Every door I ever approach is opened for me. I told him once what my dream engagement ring would be while we were both absolutely plastered, and the next day when we’d sobered up he listed off everything I’d said I liked. If I even mention I might like it, he’s already bought it for me. He checks and changes my oil because he knows I’ll never remember to do it myself and never lets me go to work without caffeine because he knows I’ll have a headache. I’m so taken care of. I forgot what it feels like to have a relationship that makes you feel better. I’m smiling for no reason. Coworkers have commented on it. I feel prettier. I try harder. My house is cleaner.

I was really happy to not be in a relationship anymore and didn't want or need a significant other, I was just happy with my friends and my hobbies. Also I just have been recovering from months of daily anxiety and bad panic attacks and I struggled a lot with eating and didn't eat enough. When I met him, everything happened just so naturally. In the beginning I just thought: maybe we'll be friends. I didn't even want any romantic thoughts in my head. But with the time passing and us spending a lot of time together (almost every day), I more and more noticed that he actually was exactly the person I have always been wishing for to be in my life. He is really smart, we laugh about the same stuff, we both like learning new things and gaming, the list goes on... but especially emotionally we're just so similar which is really important to me. In addition, after meeting him and spending a lot of time with him, my anxiety became even less and when I was around him I had almost no more problems eating. I felt he was really good for me. After one month of knowing each other, he kissed me and after 3 months we officially got together as a couple and I am really happy with him because he makes me a better person.

Just wanted to share this! Sending love to all of you! ❤️❤️❤️ EDIT: Guys, please stop posting negative comments, this is not what this subreddit is about. I simply do not care about the negative things, because the reasons she broke up with me doesn’t matter because its in the past. I made my peace with it and I am happy with it. So stop posting negative things like: „she found someone new, good thing because she wanted to get rid of you, she never truly loved you, etc.“ How would you, a complete stranger on reddit, even know that? You dont know even me or her personally, or the relationship we had at all. So stop making assumptions about our relationships and stop posting negative things. This subreddit is about love and I just posted my side of unconditional love. I am happy we ended things on a positive note, because quarantine and long distance was getting to heavy for the both of us, so its much better this way for us. I am happy with it, and so is she. Peace. ✌🏼"},

It’s truly exceptional that I find him sleeping outside of bedtime. He isn’t a coffee person either, he just grits his teeth through any tiredness and carries on. But when he’s with me, he falls asleep rather soundly. When we cuddle, I can see the slow blinking, his breathing starts to calm down and next thing I know, he’s asleep. He always says “You’re just too comfy!” or “I just feel so relaxed!\". He will vehemently deny all the sleepy allegations, even when he’s outright snoring he will say he’s just resting his eyes. I think it is absolutely sweet. I never feel like my time is wasted if he falls asleep when he’s with me. I know it’s a truly special thing. Plus he leaves his scent all over my pillows, so I get to savour his embrace even while he's not around :)"},

We were friends all through college and decided to pursue a relationship after I opened my big mouth and blurted out that I had feelings for him. Best decision I’ve made so far, by far. The other night we were snuggling and watching tv and I was laying behind him with my arm under his pillow and my head against his back. At one point I fell asleep and when I woke up he had scooted forward so my hand was right next to his face and he was resting his head in the palm of my hand just giving little tiny kisses to my fingers and the palm of my hand while watching tv. It was the cutest thing ever and I don’t even think he realized he was doing it which made it even cuter. I loved it so much that I just laid there and didn’t move and pretended I was still asleep because I didn’t want him to be embarrassed and stop!! It makes me sooooo happy to see him be lovey dovey and vulnerable with me because so many men have a hard time expressing their feelings and he had a hard time with it for such a long time and he doesn’t really open up 100% to anyone, but he seems to be coming around to me. I absolutely adore him and I can’t wait to spend my whole life getting little hand kisses from him."},

He begrudgingly did it at first, stating that it didn’t make much sense to him. I used the excuse that it was easier to share food, but I really just liked being next to him. And ever since then his default was to sit next to me, without me even mentioning or asking for it. The waiter would put two menus across from each other, and he would just slide the menus next to each other and sit beside me so nonchalantly. It makes me melt every-time he does that. We would even sit next to each other with an extremely tiny table. To be honest, he probably doesn’t realize all the small things he does that mean so much to me. I remember everything he’s ever done for me, and small moments like these make me so happy."},
{"Title": "My girlfriend of 3 years left me and I’m so happy, so proud, and love her even more", "Author": "u/HKHRex", "Content": "We’d been through some harder times recently but I had thought we were only stronger for it. Life just happens in a way you never expect. But, I have also noticed that she’d been enjoying the things she used to less and less. She’s really been struggling with her mental health and while I found her a therapist and encouraged her to see friends and do new things it wasn’t really helping. She’s been unsure of what she wants to do in life, and I’ve just been encouraging her to pursue her interests whatever they may be but even so she’s still just been so sad. She ended talking to me after the breakup and telling me why she left me, that she’d been putting so much of her own self worth and existence on the fact that I loved her. That she’d been pushing herself to the limit just to try to have me constantly love her so she could feel like she mattered. That despite the fact that I wanted to put her first and to have her focus on herself she never could because she thought she would be letting me down in some way. I think I cried harder than I have in years. While her leaving me is devastating, I also see the woman I fell in love with through the talk. She’s such a fiercely strong and emotionally intelligent person and that she has been able to recognize this and made this decision, even though it was hard for her, makes me so proud. I’m so happy she can take this step for herself and I truly hope she can find herself again, but if the talk was any indication then I think the woman I love will be just fine. While I am immensely sad that I lost someone I thought I had a forever with, I’d be so much more sad if she stayed with me at her own expense. I think I just love her more for doing this for herself, even if it’s not meant to be for now, or ever. She will always hold such an important place in my heart, she taught me so much and I loved her in every moment. I do hope that I might one day have another chance with her, however, even if not I’ll be okay, just knowing she’s doing better and is happy is more than enough for me."},

I try not to, these days, since I have nowhere to go and nothing to get up for. His routines aren't really affected by this quarantine, he never liked leaving the house anyhow. I'm more social, I want to be outside, do new things, meet people, and I've been miserable walled-up, sometimes far more than I realise. Yesterday he asked me if I'm feeling alright, and I said I have a headache I guess. He asked if it's coffee withdrawal, since he hasn't seen me drink any recently, and I said it shouldn't be, since it's been days. Today I woke up to him awkwardly clunking around the coffee machine. He doesn't know how to use it. He doesn't drink coffee, he's never made any, but he figured he'd make me coffee. He's also started doing something he's never done before - playing some online team playing videogames with his friend he hadn't really spent much time with. I'm guessing the friend is also a more active person, and he's quarantined too, so my boyfriend is keeping him company, chatting with the headphones while they play. Some people love in such silent ways, you have to stop and listen."},

I ended up replacing my blankets and pillows with his because I missed him so bad. Well, turns out I really love his pillow, lol. It’s the only pillow I’ve ever used that doesn’t hurt my ear or shoulder when sleeping on it. Unfortunately, I have no idea what brand it is since the tag is old enough it’s just sold white. Now that we live together, I’ll playfully steal his pillow and cuddle it refusing to give it back. Tonight he tickled me until I let go and then he sat the pillow smack dab in the middle of the bed. He pulled me to him and assigned the left half to me. I said, “it’s okay, cutie. I can sleep with my pillow.” He refused and asked me to stay sleeping on his. All night, we snuggled and I slept so well. I needed to vent a little because I had tears coming out of my eyes last night from being so happy. Sometimes I don’t think he realizes how much the little things he does means to me, but he never goes unappreciated. I never thought I’d fall in love, but I fell so deep. Meeting him was the best thing that’s ever happened to me. 💜"},

{"Title": "I forgot that relationships are supposed to make you feel better about yourself.", "Author": "u/gxzzymo", "Content": "I spent six years with somebody who was the least affectionate, least willing to compromise person I’ve ever met. He didn’t touch me. He didn’t cuddle me or hold my hand. I counted once and he kissed me twice in one month. He rarely told me he loved me. We went on dates maybe once every few months, and he’d complain the whole time. Begging for the absolute bare minimum for years from the person who claims to be in love with you does horrible things to your self esteem, and I didn’t even realize it until I got out of it. Now I’m with someone else, a man that I’ve been best friends with for five years. Whereas my ex wouldn’t even tell me he loved me, this man constantly tells other people how in love with me he is. My ex never wanted to hold my hand, but I never get in a car with this man wherein he doesn’t hold my hand. I get told I’m pretty constantly. My ex used to complain about going to dinner or the movies; this man has asked to take me into the city for dinner and a symphony, to have sex with me on a hotel balcony overlooking the beach, to take me out to California to show me things he saw on his visit years ago. I get good morning texts. Every door I ever approach is opened for me. I told him once what my dream engagement ring would be while we were both absolutely plastered, and the next day when we’d sobered up he listed off everything I’d said I liked. If I even mention I might like it, he’s already bought it for me. He checks and changes my oil because he knows I’ll never remember to do it myself and never lets me go to work without caffeine because he knows I’ll have a headache. I’m so taken care of. I forgot what it feels like to have a relationship that makes you feel better. I’m smiling for no reason. Coworkers have commented on it. I feel prettier. I try harder. My house is cleaner. I have a generally better attitude. I’m sleeping better. I am so fucking STOKED to be in this relationship. I have to marry him. He’s it. I just know it."},

All we ahead of us was pitch black and the tail light. After hours of talking and listening to music,  I start to fall asleep in the passenger seat but wake up shortly after to him singing to songs I had no idea he was interested in, word for word. I pretended to still be asleep because seeing him happy made me feel happy inside. An hour later he pulls up to a hotel, got all our stuff into a room and then came to me. He still had no idea I was awake (I think) and he carried me between his arms to the room. He was struggling but it was still super cute! He lied me down, tucked me in, and kissed me on my forehead. After that, I he fell right into the bed next to me, with all his clothes still on . I kept staring at him the whole night. When I woke up my heart was filled. I went to cuddle him and he acted so confused to why I was so happy. Looking back at it, he probably did know I was awake, but I didn't want to ruin it. :)"},

Friday evening my boyfriend and I got into a huge, huge fight that ended with me leaving in tears. No yelling, no verbal abuse, nothing. Just very emotional. I must have caught a stomach bug or ate something bad, because Friday night til Saturday evening, I was vomiting my guts out. I literally couldn’t move a muscle without having to puke. I texted my boyfriend that I was feeling awful and he immediately rushed over with medicine. He built me a little bed next to the toilet, rushed out for some stomach safe food, held my hand while I shivered with a fever. He swaddled me when I was freezing, held ice to my head when I was burning up. He ran out to grab some stomach safe food again and gave me ice chips. I wanted to apologize for my part in our fight and he just stroked my hair and said everything was okay. I asked him if he was mad and he said no, he was just worried about me. And that he would always love and support me, no matter what. I have never felt so supported in my entire life. So completely accepted and fully and deeply loved.

I was really happy to not be in a relationship anymore and didn't want or need a significant other, I was just happy with my friends and my hobbies. Also I just have been recovering from months of daily anxiety and bad panic attacks and I struggled a lot with eating and didn't eat enough. When I met him, everything happened just so naturally. In the beginning I just thought: maybe we'll be friends. I didn't even want any romantic thoughts in my head. But with the time passing and us spending a lot of time together (almost every day), I more and more noticed that he actually was exactly the person I have always been wishing for to be in my life. He is really smart, we laugh about the same stuff, we both like learning new things and gaming, the list goes on... but especially emotionally we're just so similar which is really important to me. In addition, after meeting him and spending a lot of time with him, my anxiety became even less and when I was around him I had almost no more problems eating. I felt he was really good for me. After one month of knowing each other, he kissed me and after 3 months we officially got together as a couple and I am really happy with him because he makes me a better person. Sorry for this long and chaotic post, but what I wanted to tell you guys, is that it's more likely to find love if you don't actually look for or pressure it and just let the things happen naturally.

We started talking about our future plans and how grateful we are to have each other. She then brought up marriage (which we have talked about before) and I jokingly asked her “so are you asking me to get married this time!?” Just as I finished asking, we made eye contact, which is when I realized there was a little box in front of my face. Turns out, she was asking me! Inside the box was an engagement ring that her sister designed! I was in shock, out of words, but the happiest I have been in a long time. We went for dinner afterwards as I was still processing what just happened. I love her so much and am now happily engaged."},

I said yes and he got his brush and asked me to sit down and very gently started to part and brush all my hair. I don’t know why but I was sitting on the bed and he was standing and I just leaned into him and he kind of cradled my face with his arm against his chest and just brushed my hair out smooth. It was so nice and comforting and I just felt so loved and taken care of. It almost made me cry it was so sweet and loving, I’m very lucky.  It took about 15 minutes because I have very thick hair  and he worked extra softly to get my knots out. Just wanted to share this sweet moment that shocked me with how lovely it felt.

And ever since then his default was to sit next to me, without me even mentioning or asking for it. The waiter would put two menus across from each other, and he would just slide the menus next to each other and sit beside me so nonchalantly. It makes me melt every-time he does that. We would even sit next to each other with an extremely tiny table. To be honest, he probably doesn’t realize all the small things he does that mean so much to me. I remember everything he’s ever done for me, and small moments like these make me so happy."},
{"Title": "My girlfriend of 3 years left me and I’m so happy, so proud, and love her even more", "Author": "u/HKHRex", "Content": "We’d been through some harder times recently but I had thought we were only stronger for it. Life just happens in a way you never expect. But, I have also noticed that she’d been enjoying the things she used to less and less. She’s really been struggling with her mental health and while I found her a therapist and encouraged her to see friends and do new things it wasn’t really helping. She’s been unsure of what she wants to do in life, and I’ve just been encouraging her to pursue her interests whatever they may be but even so she’s still just been so sad. She ended talking to me after the breakup and telling me why she left me, that she’d been putting so much of her own self worth and existence on the fact that I loved her. That she’d been pushing herself to the limit just to try to have me constantly love her so she could feel like she mattered. That despite the fact that I wanted to put her first and to have her focus on herself she never could because she thought she would be letting me down in some way. I think I cried harder than I have in years. While her leaving me is devastating, I also see the woman I fell in love with through the talk. She’s such a fiercely strong and emotionally intelligent person and that she has been able to recognize this and made this decision, even though it was hard for her, makes me so proud. I’m so happy she can take this step for herself and I truly hope she can find herself again, but if the talk was any indication then I think the woman I love will be just fine. While I am immensely sad that I lost someone I thought I had a forever with, I’d be so much more sad if she stayed with me at her own expense. I think I just love her more for doing this for herself, even if it’s not meant to be for now, or ever. She will always hold such an important place in my heart, she taught me so much and I loved her in every moment. I do hope that I might one day have another chance with her, however, even if not I’ll be okay, just knowing she’s doing better and is happy is more than enough for me."},

Yesterday he asked me if I'm feeling alright, and I said I have a headache I guess. He asked if it's coffee withdrawal, since he hasn't seen me drink any recently, and I said it shouldn't be, since it's been days. Today I woke up to him awkwardly clunking around the coffee machine. He doesn't know how to use it. He doesn't drink coffee, he's never made any, but he figured he'd make me coffee. He's also started doing something he's never done before - playing some online team playing videogames with his friend he hadn't really spent much time with. I'm guessing the friend is also a more active person, and he's quarantined too, so my boyfriend is keeping him company, chatting with the headphones while they play.

Now that we live together, I’ll playfully steal his pillow and cuddle it refusing to give it back. Tonight he tickled me until I let go and then he sat the pillow smack dab in the middle of the bed. He pulled me to him and assigned the left half to me. I said, “it’s okay, cutie. I can sleep with my pillow.” He refused and asked me to stay sleeping on his. All night, we snuggled and I slept so well. I needed to vent a little because I had tears coming out of my eyes last night from being so happy. Sometimes I don’t think he realizes how much the little things he does means to me, but he never goes unappreciated. I never thought I’d fall in love, but I fell so deep.

Everything I didn't have in my last relationships I have with her. Our communication is fantastic, she makes me happy, we complete each other. I truly love her with my whole heart.

He worked for corporate, I worked for a store... it was a NSFW/Nicholas Sparks Notebook kind of love. A true affair of the heart. Anyway, it’s been five years that we have been together. About a year ago he noticed that I truly hated the task of washing my long, thick hair. He offered once while we were showering to wash it for me. I happily agreed, and he spent the next thirty minutes figuring how to get the soap to penetrate through my tangled locks. It was the best shampoo I’ve ever had. In April, it will make a full year that every other day (or as close to that as possible) we take every shower together, and he washes my hair. We have a busy life and that extra 30 minutes he could use for himself, for me time. But he chooses to shower with me and wash my hair. It’s such a simple, small task to him, but it means the world to me. I love you so much, Reggie. ❤️ *3/23/20 I can’t believe this post is still going around!

A little backstory - Junior year in high school I had a date to homecoming. It wasn’t my girlfriend or anything, but it was a chick that I had met from two of my friends. Basically, long story short – during most of the night she had to go to the bathroom or get some water, but it turns out that she was dancing with my best friend. But me being the type of never give up, I tried to kiss her (first kiss I attempted) and she turned her face and I may have barely grazed her cheek. Present day, I was driving by all of the important places to me because I wanted to share them with the woman that I love more than anything else. So I showed her old apartments, where I used to work, where my friends lived, parent’s house, etc.. Then I took her to the high school (I had already told her about both junior and senior dances being unsuccessful) and as we were leaving, she grabbed me, pulled me in close, and kissed me. And she said, “Now you’ve had a girl you love kiss you here.” And it was so sweet. She is just the sweetest woman that I have ever met, and I am so lucky that she even gives me the time of day, let alone loves me. It is something that her and I do sometimes, where we “rewrite old memories” with better ones. I’ve rewritten some for her, and she has rewritten some for me. We basically make a more perfect memory together now than one that could have been created in the past. Man, I love this woman so much! She is by far the best thing that ever happened to me and I smile at the most random times of the day thinking about her. She is gorgeous, funny, a genius, and so sweet! I love her so much. Cuerpo, alma, y corazón. Tú más q nadie mereces ser feliz EDIT: TL/DR: She makes me melt everyday, but when she did this I felt something else completely!"},

{"Title": "I caught him off guard and it was the cutest thing ever.", "Author": "u/fictionalkearacter", "Content": "The other day I decided to surprise my boyfriend while he was working by just showing up. Once he had talked about wanting me to come see him at work in conversation, which gave me an idea. I didnt let myself react to it that much in hopes that'd he forget his own comment, so I gave him kind of an \"Oh yeah, I should when our work schedules line up.\" nonchalant response. I really wanted to catch him off guard, but I really wanted to see him. Well the day arrived when our schedules lined up. I got off work while he was a couple hours into his shift. I texted him that I was leaving work, like I normally do and usually I text him when I get to our house if he's not already there. Again, the art of surprise needed to be on my side so I had to get sneaky. So I knew I had to time my drive right as to not raise any suspicion... (occasionally he'll check my location around the time I'm supposed to arrive home so he knows I did safely). So, I'm calculating that if it takes me 15 minutes to get home and it'll take me 25 minutes to get to his work... I can totally make it so it doesn't look suspicious. I booked it. I made that 25 into 18. When I pulled into the parking lot of his store my heart was racing! I was just giddy to see him and his reaction. Even though we've been together for a little over a year now, he still puts butterflies in my stomach. He was working the registers, I could see him walk past the front doors and thought, \"Well shit, he'll see me right off the bat!\" Kind of an oh well, but I march my ass up to the store, (think like a smaller Lowe's/Home Depot) and walk through the doors. I look at him and... he's fucking oblivious, has no clue I walked in. I'm probably like a giant alligators length away from him. I quickly just decided to keep it that way and I disappeared for a few moments between the shelves, just wandering. I finally pop in his checkout line and wait. I watch him, he looks so stern. His lips pursed just a little bit, eyes look bored, but his movements are quick and efficient. He's a good worker, but he definitely has resting bitch face syndrome. I think its cute. I'm still standing in line holding my fricking breath. Every time he looks up from his register and glances around I wonder if he'll FINALLY see me. He glances up once again, scans the line and lands on me, double takes for half a second and immediately the biggest smile spreads over his face accompanied by a slight head tilt. Kind of as  a silent \"Hey you're here?!\". Watching his eyes light up and him smile at me like that just made me grin back just as hard. I love him so much and I love how happy he got as soon as he saw me and that smile didnt leave either of our faces. I know it's such a silly thing and it's not like we dont see each other every day because we live together, but I'm just glad I got that sweet little moment with him. TL;DR I got a little sneaky the other day so I could catch my boyfriend off guard at work. He made my heart melt when he lit up like a Christmas tree as soon as he saw me. So cute. EDIT: Aw guys thank you so much for the support! I never thought I get this much attention from this post, I was literally gushing so hard internally I had to let some of it spill. I showed my boyfriend the post and he immediately was all smiles and said \"We're famous now!\". He also made me show his mom, she read it and she thought it was sweet/funny and we had a laugh over, \"Oh yeah, he totally does have resting bitch face\" and his gleeful, but jokingly cocky bragging about our new found \"fame\". Im just so thankful for my boyfriend he's so sweet and cute and gushy. You know how when you see a puppy or a baby and it's just so adorable you have to clench your teeth and your stomach ties up in knots from excitement and you just wanna, I dunno, have that weird urge to like eat it or maybe just squeeze it really hard or something? Maybe someone will understand the feeling I'm trying to describe. Lol I promise I'm not crazy, I just have really intense emotions for this boy. THANK YOU!"},

I remember telling the worker there that I’d definitely be bringing my girlfriend here at some point. Well, fast forward. I got home from work one day. She was all made up, absolutely beautiful. I put my leather jacket on and we drove about 30 minutes to get where we were going. Once again, she had no idea. We got there, both absolutely hungry. I ordered a large Buffalo chicken salad, chicken strips with a side of Honey Mustard, and some deep fried Oreos. She ordered a small Buffalo chicken salad, a bacon cheeseburger, and some bacon cheese fries, and we both got Pepsi’s. When we were waiting for our food, I just saw her scanning the room, appreciating it like she was a kid in the candy store. I took an opportunity and snapped a pic of her, it’s one of my absolute favorite pictures of her. Her eyes are shining and she looks so happy. It makes me melt. The food? Absolutely delicious. It did not disappoint. I knew in my head that if I didn’t pay for it without her knowing, she would insist on paying for her own meal. She’d put up a fight. I admire her independence. So, I snuck to the “bathroom” and paid the bill. She was all like: “You know you didn’t have to do that, I could’ve paid for myself.” I responded with: “Listen, you paid for my dinner last time, I don’t want you to worry about the bill, this time.” She smiled and thanked me, gave me a big kiss on my forehead and we went home to sleep peacefully with our filled up tummies."},

It's really rare for us to get on each other's nerves cause we are the kind of couple who just get along well effortlessly. He was tired and I was tired as well and one thing led to another. We were yelling at each other and it was horrible. so I decided to sleep in another room. But I wasn't able to. We always used to cuddle while sleeping. We loved to keep our bodies as close to each other as we can. His warmth, his smell, his soft nuzzles, and snores. I loved sleeping with him as it gave me a feeling of being protected and loved. But today was not the case. So I lay on the bed thinking deep of the situation I was in and what I could have done. I realized that no matter who was at fault, it was wrong of me to raise my voice. And once I reached this realization, I ran back to our shared room. When I opened the door, I saw him sitting on the bed with a pillow in his lap. I met his eyes and knew it in an instant that he reached the same realization. I wanted to apologize first. \"I am sorry for raising my voice on you. No matter what happened, I should have seen things from your perspective as well. I am so selfish. It's just that I went to lay in that dark room all alone by myself and it hit me that this is the kind of place where I don't want to be. My body craves for your warmth. For your soft lisps, your soft nuzzles, and when you hug me tighter in the middle of the night. I missed you. I missed you so much when you weren't even gone anywhere. And I can't imagine anything happening to us so I am here to apologize.\" I was actually sobbing while saying all this to him. He just looked me with a soft look in his eyes and pulled me in a warm embrace. It was so soothing and reassuring. \"Let's sleep now, okay? We will talk about this tomorrow\" He said in his soft voice. \"yes\" And I was there. Once again, beside him, feeling loved and protected again. He woke up early and made me some breakfast and then we talked about our fight and our opinions. We reached a mutual understanding and played Mario kart after that (I absolutely slaughtered him in the game btw ;) I wanted to write about this just to tell you that don't give up on love. Its never too late and you can always do something about it. Try to communicate with your partner, get to know what she/he/they want, be honest with him/her/them, and don't give up.

So bad that I was bedridden for my entire first trimester and a couple weeks into my second trimester.

I told my boyfriend that I feel so nasty and gross for not being able to shower very often due to the sickness and lack of energy. You know what he did? He told me to pick some comfy pajamas and a candle and he’d run a bath for me. Not only did he run the bath with bubbles, music, a candle, and a warm towel. He washed my hair for me and brushed it when I was done in the bath. I’ve never felt so loved and cherished in my whole life. Instead of calling me gross or scolding me like past partners would have done, he took care of me and calmed me down.

In the beginning of the middle of this pandemic we would work the same schedule so we would stay up until 4 in the morning on our weeks off to talk and text. We finished TV shows together and would discuss them together. I loved the attention and the lack of toxicity in our friendship. It was so beautiful. We started hanging out more often and eventually I was spending weeks with her and only going back to my place for a new backpack full of clothes. Everything I didn't have in my last relationships I have with her. Our communication is fantastic, she makes me happy, we complete each other. I truly love her with my whole heart. I am SO happy with where I'm at in life right now. I plan on proposing to her at the end of the year. I cant see my future with anyone else other than her. I've always said that if I found the person I want to spend the rest of my life with I will propose to them in Paris in front of the Eiffel Tower so that is what I intend to do. I'm going to start saving money to be able to get us both to Paris. But before I do that I want to make sure I have a career to build our life together. I cant support a family on the wage I'm making now. But I know that if I want her in my life I will have to start doing things for us both. She deserves nothing but 100% of my efforts.

I was so shocked, all I had told him was that I was trying to think of a song, I didn't say any lyrics or sing the tune or anything. He barely even knows the song. It was so wonderfully strange. He even knows what I'm feeling before I do. I suffer with PTSD and he knows when something is up with me immediately. And I couldn't have asked for a more supportive partner for it.

Most people think that he served in some type of military unit or was a police officer at some point. He was none of those things. In fact, we met while working for the adult company Adam & Eve. He worked for corporate, I worked for a store... it was a NSFW/Nicholas Sparks Notebook kind of love. A true affair of the heart. Anyway, it’s been five years that we have been together. About a year ago he noticed that I truly hated the task of washing my long, thick hair. He offered once while we were showering to wash it for me. I happily agreed, and he spent the next thirty minutes figuring how to get the soap to penetrate through my tangled locks. It was the best shampoo I’ve ever had. In April, it will make a full year that every other day (or as close to that as possible) we take every shower together, and he washes my hair. We have a busy life and that extra 30 minutes he could use for himself, for me time. But he chooses to shower with me and wash my hair. It’s such a simple, small task to him, but it means the world to me. I love you so much, Reggie. ❤️ *3/23/20 I can’t believe this post is still going around! My husband and I are currently staying at home due to COVID-19. We are spending this time falling more in love with each other.

{"Title": "She has done so many sweet things for me, but this one made me melt", "Author": "Unknown author", "Content": "So, my gf (27 F) and I (26 M) finally went to my hometown. A little backstory - Junior year in high school I had a date to homecoming. It wasn’t my girlfriend or anything, but it was a chick that I had met from two of my friends. Basically, long story short – during most of the night she had to go to the bathroom or get some water, but it turns out that she was dancing with my best friend. But me being the type of never give up, I tried to kiss her (first kiss I attempted) and she turned her face and I may have barely grazed her cheek. Present day, I was driving by all of the important places to me because I wanted to share them with the woman that I love more than anything else. So I showed her old apartments, where I used to work, where my friends lived, parent’s house, etc.. Then I took her to the high school (I had already told her about both junior and senior dances being unsuccessful) and as we were leaving, she grabbed me, pulled me in close, and kissed me. And she said, “Now you’ve had a girl you love kiss you here.” And it was so sweet. She is just the sweetest woman that I have ever met, and I am so lucky that she even gives me the time of day, let alone loves me. It is something that her and I do sometimes, where we “rewrite old memories” with better ones. I’ve rewritten some for her, and she has rewritten some for me. We basically make a more perfect memory together now than one that could have been created in the past. Man, I love this woman so much! She is by far the best thing that ever happened to me and I smile at the most random times of the day thinking about her. She is gorgeous, funny, a genius, and so sweet! I love her so much. Cuerpo, alma, y corazón. Tú más q nadie mereces ser feliz EDIT: TL/DR: She makes me melt everyday, but when she did this I felt something else completely!"},

She normally does not respond to anything I say or do when she’s asleep, except when I say I love you to her. Without fail, every single time I say I love her she always says she loves me too. I’ve been testing this out lately and have said things like “the house is on fire!” “The apocalypse has started!” but nothing.

{"Title": "I caught him off guard and it was the cutest thing ever.", "Author": "u/fictionalkearacter", "Content": "The other day I decided to surprise my boyfriend while he was working by just showing up. Once he had talked about wanting me to come see him at work in conversation, which gave me an idea. I didnt let myself react to it that much in hopes that'd he forget his own comment, so I gave him kind of an \"Oh yeah, I should when our work schedules line up.\" nonchalant response. I really wanted to catch him off guard, but I really wanted to see him. Well the day arrived when our schedules lined up. I got off work while he was a couple hours into his shift. I texted him that I was leaving work, like I normally do and usually I text him when I get to our house if he's not already there. Again, the art of surprise needed to be on my side so I had to get sneaky. So I knew I had to time my drive right as to not raise any suspicion... (occasionally he'll check my location around the time I'm supposed to arrive home so he knows I did safely). So, I'm calculating that if it takes me 15 minutes to get home and it'll take me 25 minutes to get to his work... I can totally make it so it doesn't look suspicious. I booked it. I made that 25 into 18. When I pulled into the parking lot of his store my heart was racing! I was just giddy to see him and his reaction. Even though we've been together for a little over a year now, he still puts butterflies in my stomach. He was working the registers, I could see him walk past the front doors and thought, \"Well shit, he'll see me right off the bat!\" Kind of an oh well, but I march my ass up to the store, (think like a smaller Lowe's/Home Depot) and walk through the doors. I look at him and... he's fucking oblivious, has no clue I walked in. I'm probably like a giant alligators length away from him. I quickly just decided to keep it that way and I disappeared for a few moments between the shelves, just wandering. I finally pop in his checkout line and wait. I watch him, he looks so stern. His lips pursed just a little bit, eyes look bored, but his movements are quick and efficient. He's a good worker, but he definitely has resting bitch face syndrome. I think its cute. I'm still standing in line holding my fricking breath. Every time he looks up from his register and glances around I wonder if he'll FINALLY see me. He glances up once again, scans the line and lands on me, double takes for half a second and immediately the biggest smile spreads over his face accompanied by a slight head tilt. Kind of as  a silent \"Hey you're here?!\". Watching his eyes light up and him smile at me like that just made me grin back just as hard. I love him so much and I love how happy he got as soon as he saw me and that smile didnt leave either of our faces. I know it's such a silly thing and it's not like we dont see each other every day because we live together, but I'm just glad I got that sweet little moment with him. TL;DR I got a little sneaky the other day so I could catch my boyfriend off guard at work. He made my heart melt when he lit up like a Christmas tree as soon as he saw me. So cute. EDIT: Aw guys thank you so much for the support! I never thought I get this much attention from this post, I was literally gushing so hard internally I had to let some of it spill. I showed my boyfriend the post and he immediately was all smiles and said \"We're famous now!\". He also made me show his mom, she read it and she thought it was sweet/funny and we had a laugh over, \"Oh yeah, he totally does have resting bitch face\" and his gleeful, but jokingly cocky bragging about our new found \"fame\". Im just so thankful for my boyfriend he's so sweet and cute and gushy. You know how when you see a puppy or a baby and it's just so adorable you have to clench your teeth and your stomach ties up in knots from excitement and you just wanna, I dunno, have that weird urge to like eat it or maybe just squeeze it really hard or something? Maybe someone will understand the feeling I'm trying to describe. Lol I promise I'm not crazy, I just have really intense emotions for this boy. THANK YOU!"},

I remember telling the worker there that I’d definitely be bringing my girlfriend here at some point. Well, fast forward. I got home from work one day. She was all made up, absolutely beautiful. I put my leather jacket on and we drove about 30 minutes to get where we were going. Once again, she had no idea. We got there, both absolutely hungry. I ordered a large Buffalo chicken salad, chicken strips with a side of Honey Mustard, and some deep fried Oreos. She ordered a small Buffalo chicken salad, a bacon cheeseburger, and some bacon cheese fries, and we both got Pepsi’s. When we were waiting for our food, I just saw her scanning the room, appreciating it like she was a kid in the candy store. I took an opportunity and snapped a pic of her, it’s one of my absolute favorite pictures of her. Her eyes are shining and she looks so happy. It makes me melt. The food? Absolutely delicious. It did not disappoint. I knew in my head that if I didn’t pay for it without her knowing, she would insist on paying for her own meal. She’d put up a fight. I admire her independence. So, I snuck to the “bathroom” and paid the bill. She was all like: “You know you didn’t have to do that, I could’ve paid for myself.” I responded with: “Listen, you paid for my dinner last time, I don’t want you to worry about the bill, this time.” She smiled and thanked me, gave me a big kiss on my forehead and we went home to sleep peacefully with our filled up tummies."},

So bad that I was bedridden for my entire first trimester and a couple weeks into my second trimester. I struggled a lot with hygiene because standing for 15 minutes to shower took the life out of me and I always felt so exhausted afterwards. I told my boyfriend that I feel so nasty and gross for not being able to shower very often due to the sickness and lack of energy. You know what he did? He told me to pick some comfy pajamas and a candle and he’d run a bath for me. Not only did he run the bath with bubbles, music, a candle, and a warm towel. He washed my hair for me and brushed it when I was done in the bath. I’ve never felt so loved and cherished in my whole life. Instead of calling me gross or scolding me like past partners would have done, he took care of me and calmed me down. This man really loves me and I’m so so lucky to be with someone that treats me this way."},

{"Title": "When someone just… loves you. It’s still so weird to me 8 years later", "Author": "u/guava_jam", "Content": "Before I(32F) met my husband(33M) 8 years ago, I was made to feel like I was too clingy, too emotional, too sensitive, etc. I was never enough for the men I loved, and I always wanted too much from them. Until I met my husband. From the start he just… loved me. I was a mess back then and I tested him a lot, but he always passed with flying colors. When I asked him if he knew he was being tested he said yes, but that he understood because of everything I had been through. We’d spend hours over the weekends in bed just snuggling until I was overstimulated which was never a thing because no one ever wanted to do that with me. 8 years later it’s still the same, we can spend all day happily hanging out in bed and just getting up for food and to pee, which is our plan for this Sunday. Sometimes my insecurities from the past creep up and last night I asked him, “Aren’t I too much sometimes?” He responded, “No. What do you mean?” And I reminded him that even I know I can still be way intense, energetic, and physically and emotionally needy sometimes and he said, “Well that’s you and I just love you. I don’t have to think about it harder than that.” This morning while he was working I sent him a joke video about getting me baby Highlander cows for Valentine’s Day. Within 15 minutes he sent me info about a farm an hour away that offers private tours to feed and snuggle baby cows. I never knew this was a thing and we’ve set a date to go. I love this man so much, and I still find it so weird that he just loves me and I don’t have to play games or pretend to be anyone else. I do try to hold myself back when I know he needs time alone as we are both pretty introverted, but if ever I feel disconnected from him I just say so and he will open his arms without hesitation so I can jump in. The only time I can’t do that is when he is in a meeting lol. I don’t know how I got this lucky. Edit: thanks for the love everyone 💕"},

I knew I was a goner. It was a simple moment, not after sex or anything with heightened emotions, just a simple moment. That’s when I knew, I truly loved you. I just didn’t want to say it first because of how hard I pursued you, and how long you took to come around” I’m a very hard person to get to know because I don’t let others in easily. He stuck through it for months of me saying “I’m not sure yet” and I am so glad he did. We’ve been officially dating a year and 4 months now. It’s my longest relationship ever and I cannot wait to marry this man one day. We are literally soul mates.

He sat upright and I thought he was annoyed with me, that made me cry a bit more. He sat cross-legged, took me by my arm (I was facing away from him) and just said \"come here\" in a soft whisper. I sat on his lap, wrapped my arms and legs around him and cried. It was a chilly night so he wrapped the blanket around the both of us and slowly rocked back and forth while rubbing my back slowly and giving me light/soft kisses here and there. At one point he whispered \"cry your heart out if you want to dear, ive got you\". And I did, I cried quite a bit but it was okay, he was there, rocking me back and forth gently in his embrace, reassuring me and giving me soft kisses throughout. After I was done, I felt so much better. I was smiling and giggling a bit too. He gave me more kisses, quickly ran his fingers through my hair, smiled and tickled me too. It was such a nice feeling after crying so much that my eyes felt sore. He cuddled with me to sleep, making sure I was okay. I'm so grateful."},

I’ve finished chemo 2 1/2 months ago, and I’ve just now started to look a bit more like a human being, lol. Seeing how I looked over the past few months breaks my heart, honestly. I wasn’t doing too bad physically all things considered, but holy shit, I looked like I was from a different species at times. Deep bags under my eyes, blue lips, yellow skin, bald, eyebrows gone… picture a naked mole rat on the brink of death and yeah, that’s exactly what I looked like at times. And yet, my boyfriend constantly made me feel like the sun shined out of my bald ass. Frankly speaking, I have no idea how we have managed to have an active sex life while I was going through treatment, but he didn’t make it look difficult at all. Mind you, this is not a long relationship: I am 23, he’s 25, and we’ve been together for just a bit over 6 months now. We’ve met while I was going through treatment: I never would’ve started a relationship in those circumstances, but he made it seem like the easiest, most natural thing. He has known about my condition from the very start, and he has never been intimidated by it. If anything, I feel like it makes him love me even more. My last boyfriend broke up with me due to cancer, so this is such a huge deal for me. He takes care of me with such kindness and patience, I don’t know how he does it. He has never made me feel like a burden in the slightest. Whenever I feel bad, either physically or mentally, he just showers me with a seemingly infinite supply of love and care. I can’t believe I am lucky enough to have someone like him in my life. Staying alive is so hard at times, but it becomes easy when I think of those in my life who want me to stay alive. If my cancer ever recurs, I’ll take any treatment with a smile on my face for more time with those I love, him especially. With how hard it’s been at times, I feel like staying alive and sane is the biggest act of love I have to give. I didn’t think men like him existed, especially after my last boyfriend - but they do. If any of you reading this ever feel like you’re too much for anyone to love, take me as living (for now, LOL) proof that there’s someone out there for you.

{"Title": "My boyfriend keeps making me coffees that I can barely keep down but I will \"gladly\" keep drinking them", "Author": "u/thepieintheoven", "Content": "When I was younger my mom used to make what she would call \"children's coffee\", which was essentially heated soy milk (I'm lactose intolerant) mixed with a bit of instant coffee powder. One day while my bf and I were at my parents' house, I asked my mom to make me this \"children's coffee\" and my boyfriend asked me what that was and I explained the story behind it and how I used to drink it a lot when I was younger. That's where it all began. Ffw a few weeks, we're at his mom's house and for a change there's soy milk in the fridge there (leftover from a family holiday we went on) so he asks me if I want children's coffee. Surprised, I asked him if he wanted to make it for me and he said yes. So obviously I agreed, it's a cute gesture. And it was good. Better than my mom's, even. Which is what I told him too. I guess from that point on it became his go-to act of service, because every single day when we're together he asks me if I want children's coffee, sometimes more than once a day too. Every time I say yes, because I can tell it makes him happy to make the coffees. But here's the problem: his recipe tastes HORRIBLE with almond milk. At least the almond milk we have at my parents' house. My mom does not want soy milk in her house because of the estrogen, so this substitute is the only thing my bf could use for the coffee, but man it tastes bad. I'm talking \"the flavor gives me a nauseated feeling if I drink more than half of it\" kind of bad. Still, every time he prepares it for me in the morning, I force myself to drink it all. I've asked him to switch up the recipe a bit to accommodate for the different milk substitute, but it's like no matter what he does, each time it ends up tasting worse. But whenever he hands me that coffee mug with a proud smile on his face it's like he just handed me a cup of love, how could I not drink that? There are many ways to get out of this situation. I am not afraid of being honest. I could easily tell him it just doesn't taste good with almond milk and he will not get upset. But I don't want to. I don't want him to stop doing this. It's almost like the bad flavor makes it better/sweeter? Sometimes I even consider asking him myself if he wants to make me that coffee, knowing it will taste bad. I guess that's just how love works."},

You made me smile, laugh, cry, FEEL, for the first time in years. We had passion, chemistry, connection, intellectual conversation, fun, mind blowing sex. Our relationship was beautiful and has so much potential to be beautiful for a long time. You are so smart, kind, fit, happy, self aware, full of self love and love for others. You set boundaries better than any person I have ever met. All of which are aspects of you that I truly admire. I had learned, and still have so much to learn, from you. In our time together, you made me a better man, a better human, a better partner. You challenged me in so many ways - I miss this. I miss you. I’m in love with you. There is no other way to say it.

{"Title": "What's the difference between loving someone and being IN love with them?", "Author": "u/SunfireElfAmaya", "Content": "I'm 19NB and have been trying to understand the difference. Like, I get loving someone—you appreciate who they are, you enjoy being around them, you feel loved and safe with them etc—but how does that differ from being in love with them ie loving them romantically not platonically? For example, your best friend vs your romantic partner, you love both of them but other than (presumably) also being sexually attracted to your partner and not to your friend (would also appreciate if anyone has advice on what that actually means, is it literally looking at someone and having a desire to have sex with them?), is there a difference in how you feel about them?

We hadn’t been together for very long, just a couple months, but we both knew it was very different from anything else we had experienced. We had unashamed conversations of marriage, children, homes, issues, exes, strengths, weaknesses and just what life would be like together. It felt so right, but not in a rose colored glasses way, in a very raw and vulnerable way. One night we were at my house and we were drinking a little bit of wine, we went out to look at the stars and have a little smoke. We were in the middle of a silly conversation and he did a totally random 180 to ask me about what kind of tree growth my woods were (he works in forestry!). I laughed so hard and let the I love you I had been holding on the tip of my tongue for weeks slip. He just laughed along with me and the night continued without mention of what I said. The next day rolls around and this part of the story gets a little confusing but I’ll give the short version. Basically I had a friend who was friends with my partners ex girlfriend. That friend (m) liked to tell me(f) all the negative details of my partners past relationship. I hear another story from this friend and shoot my partner a text. (just to clarify we had been openly communicating about his previous relationship from day one prior to my friends input, as well as all of my previous relationships). I tell him that i heard more from my friend and would like to talk. He comes right over even though i was just expecting a phone call. After we talked everything through we go outside again to let the dogs out. He starts apologizing for putting me through all of this drama because he knows it’s not really enjoyable for anyone involved. We talk a bit more and I just tell him that it’s okay, and I trust him, and that our relationship is what we make it and these things don’t have to influence us negatively, they can build us up. He says “I think I love you.”, and I tell him that “I know I love you.”…. A day or two later we’re talking about it and HE NEVER HEARD MY I LOVE YOU FROM THE PREVIOUS NIGHT!!! He thought he was saying it first and I thought I had said it first. I just find that to be the cutest thing. Neither of us were afraid of taking that first step. Everything was perfectly balanced and it makes me feel incredibly happy to think about. He is my person. Thank you for reading♥️"},

I just moved here and was feeling a bit nostalgic, so I decided to check out a few local restaurants to ask about job openings. I figured finding something to do at night a party from my day job would help me settle in. After a few stops, I found this place called Le Colonial, which is a cool mix of Vietnamese and French cuisine. It really caught my eye. Inside, I met someone who really stood out. The manager—a young blonde with the most striking blue eyes I’ve ever seen—initially threw me off because I thought she was the hostess! After a quick chat, I left, but I couldn't stop thinking about her. So, 15 to 20 minutes later, I walked back in, pretending I needed a business card, but honestly, I just wanted to see her again and ask her out. When I asked her out, she seemed pleasantly surprised and genuinely happy, even though she mentioned she had a boyfriend. Her warm smile didn’t stop me. I took the business card, smiled back, and hinted that I’d be back. Boyfriend or not, I felt a connection I couldn't ignore. Hopefully, she’s not getting married anytime soon! I forgot to ask her name and it wasn’t on the card since she wasn’t the general manager, but I’ll make sure to remember it next time. Those eyes are hard to forget! Has anyone else had a spontaneous encounter like this? Any tips for my next visit to Le Colonial? I’d like to build a genuine connection with this beautiful woman while also respecting boundaries. 😈 you never know... Q1: What are some subtle, respectful ways to show her I'm interested without overstepping? Q2: Has anyone successfully turned a friendly connection into something more? How did you do it? Q3: Any tips for balancing persistence with respect in situations like this?"},

During the next two failed relationships, he was somewhat correct; I felt I had fumbled the one man I had an authentic, non-forced romantic relationship with to try and force relationships with men who weren’t truly in love with me or compatible. During the most recent failed relationship, I told myself that at 30, I had to settle for a less-than-ideal relationship, because I had already experienced one relationship with a man who was head over heels for me. In my early 30s, I’m in a relationship where I feel secure and where my partner regularly approves he genuinely adores me. Nothing was forced, everything progressed naturally. I’m a more mature and emotionally independent person than I was when I was engaged; that relationship was doomed to fail because of my own immaturity, toxicity and codependence, but that doesn’t mean what I experienced then wasn’t true love, nor does it detract from the love I’m experiencing now.

How true is that really? In my case, if I really like someone I will start to fantasize about a life together but it’s more in the fun of getting to know each other. It isn’t like I’d actually marry them after a month but the idea is there. It’s like excitement, not love bombing or anything drastic. Are there people who didn’t have those thoughts until months or years later and everything is okay? Additional question: for those of you that were nervous about rushing into things, like the people who get nervous thinking of marriage or buying a ring, what made you change your mind? Asking this as someone who has never had a guy love bomb or vocalize thoughts like this and it’s making me a little nervous about that phrase. EDIT: thanks everyone for the replies! It’s so sweet to see how you all talk about your loved ones. Feeling a lot better :’)"},

Since then, you keep reaching out to me but not making plans with me to talk about any of this, or called me. I keep trying to be patient. We have such amazing chemistry, it's easy being with you.  I have given more of myself to you than I have to anybody else in my entire life. You could have just told me you needed a breather, I would have been fine. I just want you. I want to get close to you. You said I was beautiful, that you wanted me, that you loved being with me.  You call me sweetie and hold my hand, you took a day off work to spend time with me.

Sunday I was exhausted after getting home after it , swollen feet , and sleep deprived . Monday became a Monday for no reason, and it hit like a tidal wave .  I cleaned my car out and vacuumed it out . My dad was being annoying bc he just had to see how good of a job I did on my own car . He wanted to \" Inspect \" it . I said no your not seeing the inside of my car , I bought it and pay for it . He returned with being petty and on my case about stuff . I asked him where I could get my state inspection done , he wasn't a help . Every Monday is trash day .... he is an odd ball about it . I did the dishes after dinner and I apparently had to take the trash out asap .  I was over his attitude mostly. It hit me the wrong way , and then my bf ... I wanted to see him . I offered to get dinner and drinks and I didn't get a response till later on . It was too late to go out with him bc my dad was also making dinner at the time . I was just over the whole day , and I was still exhausted.  I got to see my bf today for lunch on his break , and it was nice . Last night I just bawled.  I bawled like a baby , bc I was over the wedding stuff , my ex husband didn't want to do a huge thing for us getting married, and I guess again grieving in a way . Grieving bc I didn't have a big wedding, grieving bc of a lot back then.  I'm not sure if it was any sort of a trigger , but damn it.

He offered to spend time with me this weekend as well,  and tomorrow night.  Sometimes , I forget that I have someone who actually cares and loves me . I felt a disconnect from him, but I over think . My gut feelings weren't screaming,  just my heart was aching . I really was sad and mad at the world . I tried to call my bestie , bc she usually helps me figure shit out . I think I understand why I was upset and what I needed.  Long story short , I feel better and get to be spoiled tomorrow night .

Either way I can't catch my breath. And I feel so stupid because you probably forgot what day is today. You probably already forgot what we were. To you, mine was just a role, right? No matter who takes it. I finally had a stable and well paid job. I was gonna get us a new home. Everything seemed perfect at first. But I guess the taller, toxic guy with a random job who lived close to you was even better. How can I start loving somebody else as easily as you did? You have fun with him while I keep dreaming of you at night. In my dreams I can see you, talk with you, hug you, lay on a bed with you. Everything feels better. Then I wake up, and everything feels worse than before. I begin asking myself, why should I even get up from bed and work? Yeah, for myself. To keep my life going. But who's giving me back the one half you took away from me? It's as if I never existed in the first place, and I hate you for what you've done to me. Still. You will always be family to me.

I feel like a teenager lol I do love him but I never said it regularly after the first time because I don’t want to put pressure on him. For a little context we both had really damaging long relationships before meeting. My husband was abusive and passed away and his ex seems to have been verbally and mentally abusive toward him.

For the last few months I’ve been dating a lovely man. Not a drug addict, looks like a model, he’s sooo kind and respectful of women, owns his own business, never shouts or takes his anger out on me. Shows me love and affection. I met him through one of my friends of 16 years who has vetted him and told him he’s good for me and tried to set us up. He accepts me whole heartedly and is supportive. My mum passed away and he supported me all the way through it and came to the funeral, he’s generous with me and showers me with adoration and wants to spend as much time with me as possible. One of my close friends told my other friend, I’m looking forward to meeting him because he seems good for her.

I eventually caved and downloaded Tinder and literally within 2 weeks I had met my amazing partner and went on our first date and a week later we were officially a couple. It was completely out of character for me to go so quickly into a relationship but it just felt natural and it was one of those things where it just felt right to take the chance. We've now been together for a year and a half and I definitely can say I found my person. We not only have similar interests but we get along so well and really understand each other. He does everything he can to make sure I'm happy in the relationship and occasionally asks if there's any issues or concerns I have. He does little things for me like take out the trash, surprise me with little things like Starbucks, or offers to get me food delivered if I'm not feeling well. He also took me to his home country and I got to meet his family and I just felt so welcomed and it was so nice to see where he grew up.

I’ve finished chemo 2 1/2 months ago, and I’ve just now started to look a bit more like a human being, lol. Seeing how I looked over the past few months breaks my heart, honestly. I wasn’t doing too bad physically all things considered, but holy shit, I looked like I was from a different species at times. Deep bags under my eyes, blue lips, yellow skin, bald, eyebrows gone… picture a naked mole rat on the brink of death and yeah, that’s exactly what I looked like at times. And yet, my boyfriend constantly made me feel like the sun shined out of my bald ass. Frankly speaking, I have no idea how we have managed to have an active sex life while I was going through treatment, but he didn’t make it look difficult at all. Mind you, this is not a long relationship: I am 23, he’s 25, and we’ve been together for just a bit over 6 months now. We’ve met while I was going through treatment: I never would’ve started a relationship in those circumstances, but he made it seem like the easiest, most natural thing. He has known about my condition from the very start, and he has never been intimidated by it. If anything, I feel like it makes him love me even more. My last boyfriend broke up with me due to cancer, so this is such a huge deal for me. He takes care of me with such kindness and patience, I don’t know how he does it. He has never made me feel like a burden in the slightest. Whenever I feel bad, either physically or mentally, he just showers me with a seemingly infinite supply of love and care. I can’t believe I am lucky enough to have someone like him in my life. Staying alive is so hard at times, but it becomes easy when I think of those in my life who want me to stay alive. If my cancer ever recurs, I’ll take any treatment with a smile on my face for more time with those I love, him especially. With how hard it’s been at times, I feel like staying alive and sane is the biggest act of love I have to give. I didn’t think men like him existed, especially after my last boyfriend - but they do. If any of you reading this ever feel like you’re too much for anyone to love, take me as living (for now, LOL) proof that there’s someone out there for you.

I just moved here and was feeling a bit nostalgic, so I decided to check out a few local restaurants to ask about job openings. I figured finding something to do at night a party from my day job would help me settle in. After a few stops, I found this place called Le Colonial, which is a cool mix of Vietnamese and French cuisine. It really caught my eye. Inside, I met someone who really stood out. The manager—a young blonde with the most striking blue eyes I’ve ever seen—initially threw me off because I thought she was the hostess! After a quick chat, I left, but I couldn't stop thinking about her. So, 15 to 20 minutes later, I walked back in, pretending I needed a business card, but honestly, I just wanted to see her again and ask her out. When I asked her out, she seemed pleasantly surprised and genuinely happy, even though she mentioned she had a boyfriend. Her warm smile didn’t stop me. I took the business card, smiled back, and hinted that I’d be back. Boyfriend or not, I felt a connection I couldn't ignore. Hopefully, she’s not getting married anytime soon! I forgot to ask her name and it wasn’t on the card since she wasn’t the general manager, but I’ll make sure to remember it next time. Those eyes are hard to forget! Has anyone else had a spontaneous encounter like this? Any tips for my next visit to Le Colonial? I’d like to build a genuine connection with this beautiful woman while also respecting boundaries. 😈 you never know...

{"Title": "My boyfriend keeps making me coffees that I can barely keep down but I will \"gladly\" keep drinking them", "Author": "u/thepieintheoven", "Content": "When I was younger my mom used to make what she would call \"children's coffee\", which was essentially heated soy milk (I'm lactose intolerant) mixed with a bit of instant coffee powder. One day while my bf and I were at my parents' house, I asked my mom to make me this \"children's coffee\" and my boyfriend asked me what that was and I explained the story behind it and how I used to drink it a lot when I was younger. That's where it all began. Ffw a few weeks, we're at his mom's house and for a change there's soy milk in the fridge there (leftover from a family holiday we went on) so he asks me if I want children's coffee. Surprised, I asked him if he wanted to make it for me and he said yes. So obviously I agreed, it's a cute gesture. And it was good. Better than my mom's, even. Which is what I told him too. I guess from that point on it became his go-to act of service, because every single day when we're together he asks me if I want children's coffee, sometimes more than once a day too. Every time I say yes, because I can tell it makes him happy to make the coffees. But here's the problem: his recipe tastes HORRIBLE with almond milk. At least the almond milk we have at my parents' house. My mom does not want soy milk in her house because of the estrogen, so this substitute is the only thing my bf could use for the coffee, but man it tastes bad. I'm talking \"the flavor gives me a nauseated feeling if I drink more than half of it\" kind of bad. Still, every time he prepares it for me in the morning, I force myself to drink it all. I've asked him to switch up the recipe a bit to accommodate for the different milk substitute, but it's like no matter what he does, each time it ends up tasting worse. But whenever he hands me that coffee mug with a proud smile on his face it's like he just handed me a cup of love, how could I not drink that? There are many ways to get out of this situation. I am not afraid of being honest. I could easily tell him it just doesn't taste good with almond milk and he will not get upset. But I don't want to. I don't want him to stop doing this. It's almost like the bad flavor makes it better/sweeter? Sometimes I even consider asking him myself if he wants to make me that coffee, knowing it will taste bad. I guess that's just how love works."},

Like, I get loving someone—you appreciate who they are, you enjoy being around them, you feel loved and safe with them etc—but how does that differ from being in love with them ie loving them romantically not platonically? For example, your best friend vs your romantic partner, you love both of them but other than (presumably) also being sexually attracted to your partner and not to your friend (would also appreciate if anyone has advice on what that actually means, is it literally looking at someone and having a desire to have sex with them?), is there a difference in how you feel about them? I feel like there has to be since I know that there are plenty of asexual people or people who just otherwise aren't interested in sex who still fall in love and differentiate between romantic and platonic relationships, so clearly being \"in love\" with someone is different than just loving them.

We hadn’t been together for very long, just a couple months, but we both knew it was very different from anything else we had experienced. We had unashamed conversations of marriage, children, homes, issues, exes, strengths, weaknesses and just what life would be like together. It felt so right, but not in a rose colored glasses way, in a very raw and vulnerable way. One night we were at my house and we were drinking a little bit of wine, we went out to look at the stars and have a little smoke. We were in the middle of a silly conversation and he did a totally random 180 to ask me about what kind of tree growth my woods were (he works in forestry!). I laughed so hard and let the I love you I had been holding on the tip of my tongue for weeks slip. He just laughed along with me and the night continued without mention of what I said. The next day rolls around and this part of the story gets a little confusing but I’ll give the short version. Basically I had a friend who was friends with my partners ex girlfriend. That friend (m) liked to tell me(f) all the negative details of my partners past relationship. I hear another story from this friend and shoot my partner a text. (just to clarify we had been openly communicating about his previous relationship from day one prior to my friends input, as well as all of my previous relationships). I tell him that i heard more from my friend and would like to talk. He comes right over even though i was just expecting a phone call. After we talked everything through we go outside again to let the dogs out. He starts apologizing for putting me through all of this drama because he knows it’s not really enjoyable for anyone involved. We talk a bit more and I just tell him that it’s okay, and I trust him, and that our relationship is what we make it and these things don’t have to influence us negatively, they can build us up. He says “I think I love you.”, and I tell him that “I know I love you.”…. A day or two later we’re talking about it and HE NEVER HEARD MY I LOVE YOU FROM THE PREVIOUS NIGHT!!! He thought he was saying it first and I thought I had said it first. I just find that to be the cutest thing. Neither of us were afraid of taking that first step. Everything was perfectly balanced and it makes me feel incredibly happy to think about. He is my person. Thank you for reading♥️"},

So, although i was not feeling it and was slightly hurt he really replies late, I still gave him a long message thanking him and letting him know i'm always here for him and that these things may have happened to him but I consoled him and told him that the Lord has better plans for him. I even told him sweet things like thanks for being a blessing etc. but he has yet to respond. I have a rough idea that he is going through something but I thought my message will cheer him up.

In my early 30s, I’m in a relationship where I feel secure and where my partner regularly approves he genuinely adores me. Nothing was forced, everything progressed naturally. I’m a more mature and emotionally independent person than I was when I was engaged; that relationship was doomed to fail because of my own immaturity, toxicity and codependence, but that doesn’t mean what I experienced then wasn’t true love, nor does it detract from the love I’m experiencing now.

After that it’s yk what time then we shower and watch tv together. It’s so simple and mundane but so meaningful. I can talk to her about anything and she just gets me and vice versa. She is the most beautiful amazing woman I’ve ever met and I’m so excited for our future. We will be moving in together near the end of the summer and I haven’t been this excited for anything in so long. She’s already started picking out decorations and furniture; it’s so adorable. She tells me she loves me at least 50 times a day. We’re both young and started supporting ourselves younger than most so it’s so nice to be with someone who understands the challenges that comes with. I would do anything for this girl. The only gripe I have is that she won’t play against me in chess because she just started and I’ve been playing for years. Anyways, I’m not that great at writing these kind of things but I hope you enjoyed."},

They say that I shouldn’t need a woman to be happy. Are they right? Well, yeah. Of course they’re right, but a woman makes life better. You would make my life better, and I would do everything in my power to add to your life. All this time I’ve spent alone is going to be worth it, because someday, you, the woman who will love me through my flaws, my depression, my past, my mistakes, my failures, my insecurities, my fears, and my emotions… will walk into my life and love me. You’ll see me, the real me. You’ll see the purity in my heart. You’ll hear the wisdom I share and feel empowered with me by your side. You’ll know that no matter what, I will still hold you, kiss you on the forehead, and tell you that I’ve got you. My dear, I make this vow to you. I vow to sacrifice for you. I vow to lift you up and permanently spin you around in a dance of love. I vow to stay by your side until your very last breath. I vow to stay loyal, to communicate with you, and to do anything and everything to protect you and our unborn children from whatever challenges or obstacles that may come our way, even death, whom I no longer fear. I will stare him in eyes for your sake, my love. When you feel weak, I will be your strength. When you feel afraid, I will lend you my hand. When you feel angry, I will soothe your pain. When you feel sad, I will comfort you. When you feel alone, I will be present. Your happiness will be my happiness. Your pleasure will be my pleasure. Your pain will be my pain. Your grief will be my grief. Your anger will be my anger. Your triumphs will be my triumphs. Your sadness will be my sadness. Your enemies will be my enemies. Your friends will be my friends. Your family will be my family. I will worship your mind, your heart, your soul, and every inch of your body. And I will serve you second to only the almighty God. And on I read, Until the day was gone, And I sat in regret, Of all the things I've done, For all that I've blessed, And all that I've wronged, In dreams until my death, I will wander on, In your house, I long to be, Room by room, patiently, I'll wait for you there, Like a stone, I'll wait for you there, Alone, Alone."},

He's also cared for my emotions and well-being, I know he won't be revengeful and vindictive with my things, our parents would've preferred to speak out anything agaisnt me. He doesn't take his stress and his bad feelings out of me, and if he will, I know he's a human being with slip-ups but it will never be intentional, a routine or a second nature. He's going to accept me, he's already suspected but accepted me anyway even if nothing is confirmed. He encourages this life style, he's so cute complementing and flattering my new hairstyle changes when I'd received threats and backlash. He's defended me when I thought he would've never dared to protest agaisnt his first most beloved person who was the one mistreating me the most.

My brother got married this past weekend,  and I'm so happy for him . Little did I know a wedding would break me down , and it did Monday night. Sunday I was exhausted after getting home after it , swollen feet , and sleep deprived . Monday became a Monday for no reason, and it hit like a tidal wave .  I cleaned my car out and vacuumed it out . My dad was being annoying bc he just had to see how good of a job I did on my own car . He wanted to \" Inspect \" it . I said no your not seeing the inside of my car , I bought it and pay for it . He returned with being petty and on my case about stuff . I asked him where I could get my state inspection done , he wasn't a help . Every Monday is trash day .... he is an odd ball about it . I did the dishes after dinner and I apparently had to take the trash out asap .  I was over his attitude mostly. It hit me the wrong way , and then my bf ... I wanted to see him . I offered to get dinner and drinks and I didn't get a response till later on . It was too late to go out with him bc my dad was also making dinner at the time . I was just over the whole day , and I was still exhausted.  I got to see my bf today for lunch on his break , and it was nice . Last night I just bawled.  I bawled like a baby , bc I was over the wedding stuff , my ex husband didn't want to do a huge thing for us getting married, and I guess again grieving in a way . Grieving bc I didn't have a big wedding, grieving bc of a lot back then.  I'm not sure if it was any sort of a trigger , but damn it.  My bf called me tonight like usual , and he is making me dinner , washed the bed sheets and wants to go to the beach for sunset tomorrow . I mentioned that I see him once a week , and it kills me . He offered to spend time with me this weekend as well,  and tomorrow night.  Sometimes , I forget that I have someone who actually cares and loves me . I felt a disconnect from him, but I over think . My gut feelings weren't screaming,  just my heart was aching . I really was sad and mad at the world . I tried to call my bestie , bc she usually helps me figure shit out . I think I understand why I was upset and what I needed.  Long story short , I feel better and get to be spoiled tomorrow night . Oh and the hot water heater blew... so a cold shower is a must tomorrow yay ."},

How true is that really? In my case, if I really like someone I will start to fantasize about a life together but it’s more in the fun of getting to know each other. It isn’t like I’d actually marry them after a month but the idea is there. It’s like excitement, not love bombing or anything drastic. Are there people who didn’t have those thoughts until months or years later and everything is okay? Additional question: for those of you that were nervous about rushing into things, like the people who get nervous thinking of marriage or buying a ring, what made you change your mind? Asking this as someone who has never had a guy love bomb or vocalize thoughts like this and it’s making me a little nervous about that phrase. EDIT: thanks everyone for the replies!

I'm trying my best to stop thinking about you although we text often and send reels a lot. I try not to be as excited to see your name pop up on my screen. You did make me happy, but it's all you. I'm just a hopeless romantic with my heart slowly repairing itself. Thanks for letting me talk to you about what has gone on in my life that made me who you see today. I know it's pointless to hold on to these feelings and I'm trying to let go of them, but that is difficult. I hope whoever you decide to be with one day knows how lucky they are to have you.

To me you are the golden beams of sunlight peeking through emerald treetops on a summers evening. You’re the nostalgia of childhood; The long lasting happy memories of being young and carefree. You are the joyful exclamation, ‘the best day ever!’ In you I see patterns perfectly aligned. I see colours a shade brighter. In you I see raindrops turn to falling diamonds. I see natures finest beauty. A heart of the most precious gold. A soul in his purest form. In fact I know that you’re one of a kind. In you I see life, I see everything that makes life worth living. In you, I see my life. I see me spending it with you. I see a locket of your heart with my photo placed in its delicate frame. In you I see my last breath. I see forever in you. - u/scrapiee"},

We'd been getting really close, really fast and the intensity of our physical relationship has been a whirlwind. Three weeks ago, that changed when we spent the night together for the first time.  You were super sweet for the next two days and then you became cold and shut me out.  You told mutual friends of ours that you needed time.  This was obviously becoming more than a FWB thing and you freaked. You promised me you wouldn't run for the hills. Since then, you keep reaching out to me but not making plans with me to talk about any of this, or called me. I keep trying to be patient. We have such amazing chemistry, it's easy being with you.  I have given more of myself to you than I have to anybody else in my entire life. You could have just told me you needed a breather, I would have been fine. I just want you. I want to get close to you. You said I was beautiful, that you wanted me, that you loved being with me.  You call me sweetie and hold my hand, you took a day off work to spend time with me. And now we're nowhere. Do you even miss me? What are you so scared of? Somebody loving you? I am trying, but I can't put myself through this for much longer.

Either way I can't catch my breath. And I feel so stupid because you probably forgot what day is today. You probably already forgot what we were. To you, mine was just a role, right? No matter who takes it. I finally had a stable and well paid job. I was gonna get us a new home. Everything seemed perfect at first. But I guess the taller, toxic guy with a random job who lived close to you was even better. How can I start loving somebody else as easily as you did? You have fun with him while I keep dreaming of you at night. In my dreams I can see you, talk with you, hug you, lay on a bed with you. Everything feels better. Then I wake up, and everything feels worse than before. I begin asking myself, why should I even get up from bed and work? Yeah, for myself. To keep my life going. But who's giving me back the one half you took away from me? It's as if I never existed in the first place, and I hate you for what you've done to me. Still. You will always be family to me.

He travels for work, usually a week or so at a time but this trip is only a day or two and I’m at his house. He woke me this morning and as he was leaving he said “I love you” my half asleep brain didn’t process it immediately so I said “be safe” Now I’m questioning if it was a slip or if he meant it. I won’t have this conversation through the phone so I’m waiting till probably tomorrow night for him to get home. I feel like a teenager lol I do love him but I never said it regularly after the first time because I don’t want to put pressure on him. For a little context we both had really damaging long relationships before meeting. My husband was abusive and passed away and his ex seems to have been verbally and mentally abusive toward him.

Two of the least toxic relationships I had still weren’t healthy, one because he sold drugs and I was a 17 year old with a drug problem due to being homeless and the second was addicted to ketamine so it came with problems, but they were both nice to me. Every other relationship I have been in as been abusive. I’ve been with narcissists, people who’ve emotionally, physically and sexually abusive to me. For the last few months I’ve been dating a lovely man. Not a drug addict, looks like a model, he’s sooo kind and respectful of women, owns his own business, never shouts or takes his anger out on me. Shows me love and affection. I met him through one of my friends of 16 years who has vetted him and told him he’s good for me and tried to set us up. He accepts me whole heartedly and is supportive. My mum passed away and he supported me all the way through it and came to the funeral, he’s generous with me and showers me with adoration and wants to spend as much time with me as possible. One of my close friends told my other friend, I’m looking forward to meeting him because he seems good for her. This other friend also knew of him, he said “he had a healthy relationship with with his ex, but (my name) has only been in toxic relationships” it made me feel that most people think I’m at fault for being abused in relationships. I feel relieved that I’ll be in a healthy relationship and won’t be victim blamed or villainised for the abuse I’ve endured, this will be the relationship that maybe will wake people up that I’m not the problem other than condoning it for too long.

He does everything he can to make sure I'm happy in the relationship and occasionally asks if there's any issues or concerns I have. He does little things for me like take out the trash, surprise me with little things like Starbucks, or offers to get me food delivered if I'm not feeling well.

{"Title": "When someone just… loves you. It’s still so weird to me 8 years later", "Author": "u/guava_jam", "Content": "Before I(32F) met my husband(33M) 8 years ago, I was made to feel like I was too clingy, too emotional, too sensitive, etc. I was never enough for the men I loved, and I always wanted too much from them. Until I met my husband. From the start he just… loved me. I was a mess back then and I tested him a lot, but he always passed with flying colors. When I asked him if he knew he was being tested he said yes, but that he understood because of everything I had been through. We’d spend hours over the weekends in bed just snuggling until I was overstimulated which was never a thing because no one ever wanted to do that with me. 8 years later it’s still the same, we can spend all day happily hanging out in bed and just getting up for food and to pee, which is our plan for this Sunday. Sometimes my insecurities from the past creep up and last night I asked him, “Aren’t I too much sometimes?” He responded, “No. What do you mean?” And I reminded him that even I know I can still be way intense, energetic, and physically and emotionally needy sometimes and he said, “Well that’s you and I just love you. I don’t have to think about it harder than that.” This morning while he was working I sent him a joke video about getting me baby Highlander cows for Valentine’s Day. Within 15 minutes he sent me info about a farm an hour away that offers private tours to feed and snuggle baby cows. I never knew this was a thing and we’ve set a date to go. I love this man so much, and I still find it so weird that he just loves me and I don’t have to play games or pretend to be anyone else. I do try to hold myself back when I know he needs time alone as we are both pretty introverted, but if ever I feel disconnected from him I just say so and he will open his arms without hesitation so I can jump in. The only time I can’t do that is when he is in a meeting lol. I don’t know how I got this lucky. Edit: thanks for the love everyone 💕"},

I knew I was a goner. It was a simple moment, not after sex or anything with heightened emotions, just a simple moment. That’s when I knew, I truly loved you. I just didn’t want to say it first because of how hard I pursued you, and how long you took to come around” I’m a very hard person to get to know because I don’t let others in easily. He stuck through it for months of me saying “I’m not sure yet” and I am so glad he did. We’ve been officially dating a year and 4 months now. It’s my longest relationship ever and I cannot wait to marry this man one day. We are literally soul mates. We have had 1 fight that got resolved later that day, and it was more of an emotional discussion than a fight. We are literally always happy together and I am a better person when I’m around him.

He sat upright and I thought he was annoyed with me, that made me cry a bit more. He sat cross-legged, took me by my arm (I was facing away from him) and just said \"come here\" in a soft whisper. I sat on his lap, wrapped my arms and legs around him and cried. It was a chilly night so he wrapped the blanket around the both of us and slowly rocked back and forth while rubbing my back slowly and giving me light/soft kisses here and there. At one point he whispered \"cry your heart out if you want to dear, ive got you\". And I did, I cried quite a bit but it was okay, he was there, rocking me back and forth gently in his embrace, reassuring me and giving me soft kisses throughout. After I was done, I felt so much better. I was smiling and giggling a bit too. He gave me more kisses, quickly ran his fingers through my hair, smiled and tickled me too. It was such a nice feeling after crying so much that my eyes felt sore. He cuddled with me to sleep, making sure I was okay. I'm so grateful."},

{"Title": "My girlfriend said something that made me want to cry because it was exactly what I was about to thank her for", "Author": "Unknown author", "Content": "So I (M22) have OCD, I was diagnosed at 14 but it’s something I’ve struggled with my whole life. One of my symptoms is hand washing (long, long before the pandemic started—I’m talking 10+ years). I wash my hands constantly to the point where they get red, dry, and the skin starts cracking. I use lotion when it gets bad but it usually doesn’t work, sometimes it provides temporary relief but I’ve pretty much accepted that my hands will always be like this. The effects on my skin are usually worse in the wintertime, but people ask me all the time why my hands are so red and why they’re so dry and I absolutely hate it. I struggle with this everyday, the compulsions of “if I don’t wash my hands right now, something bad will happen” and it’s not really an easy thing to explain to people because a lot of people see OCD as something they can just diagnose themselves because they “like to keep things organized” I could go on and on about my problem with that statement, as someone who struggles with OCD everyday—but that’s not where I’m here. Last night me and my girlfriend (F21) were just chilling at my house and my mom made a comment about how she could tell I had been home because we were running out of soap. She and my sister were talking loudly about it, and my girlfriend and I exchanged looks but neither of us said anything. I think she could tell I was a little bothered so she asked what was wrong, and I told her I was tired of hearing about how much soap I use, and that I couldn’t control it (washing my hands so much). She immediately said “I know, I know” and grabbed my arm, listening as I told her I couldn’t control it and how I don’t exactly remember when or how it started but it’d been that way for years, and I was about to thank her for never making me feel bad for it when she looked at me and said just that: “I will never make you feel bad for it babe, and I will always make sure you have all the soap in the world and never run out. Plus, I get a discount on it at my store, so it’s okay.” I wanted to cry hearing those words come out of her mouth before I even had the chance to say anything. This isn’t the first time she’s said something that’s validated my OCD; she’s made comments here and there before and is completely unbothered by it. I never thought I’d find someone who is so accepting of a mental disorder that isn’t always easy to understand. She’s never once made me feel bad for it and has always accepted me as I am. It’s not an easy battle fighting OCD like this every single day. There’s also many other factors to it that often feel debilitating and smothering. But to know that she doesn’t mind, that she can understand something she’s never had to experience before, that she loves me regardless and chooses not to make me feel bad for something I have no control over—it made me love her even more. I’m so thankful to have found this, I’m so thankful that she’s never made it a big deal. She even buys big containers of soap so it’ll last us longer. Anyways, just wanted to tell someone this. It made me feel so validated and loved in that moment—especially when she said that right as I was about to thank her for never making me feel bad about it. I’m a very lucky guy, and it was just one of those things that made me realize that. Edit: wow thank you guys so much for the love! I promise I will reply to every one of your comments!! Just wanted to leave this here so y’all know I’ve read every one of them and I appreciate your kind words, and I will respond to all of you when I can!! ❤️ Edit: sooooo last night my girlfriend found my post (she uses Reddit as well) and got SO excited and said, “oh my god!! This is about me!! Did you see all the comments babe?? People are so sweet 😭” so thank you all from both of us for the love and kind words! I also appreciate those of you that left suggestions for better lotion. I will definitely look into it seeing as winter is around the corner and I’m not prepared for how bad my hands are going to get. I’m sure I’ll find something at some point, and thanks to y’all I have plenty of options to choose from! I appreciate all the love and kind words. I wasn’t expecting this much love from this post, but I’m really glad I got it. Those of you telling me I’ve got a keeper—I definitely do. I plan on marrying this girl one day. She’s everything I’ve ever wanted and more (as cheesy as that sounds)"},

I remembered one night around Christmas time we had a movie night in 1st grade, and I remembered this girl who had asked me to cuddle during the movie. Everything hit me like a ton of bricks, a bunch more memories of this girl from first grade flooded my head. I asked her what school she had went to for that grade, and then asked her if she remembered that movie night. I could tell it hit her before I even asked.

And i just went for it. It was nothing more than a lingering peck really. But that's what was perfect about it. It was dark so the nerves were subsided a bit. And it was just us which was even better to me. It was just so innocent and sweet. And that's all I wanted for my first kiss. And he perfectly punctuated it by saying, I love you.

We sat like that the whole way to my house. And his parents aren't the type to point out affection like so many seem to do. So it was casual. But it was everything.

I’m so in love with this guy that sometimes it doesn’t seem real. I’ve known his family since I was 16. His parents have always been so welcoming and kind to me since the first time his sister had me over to hang out after school. My friend has been so supportive of us and is thrilled that we’re together but I’ve never really gotten his parent’s thoughts on us being together. I’ve been to their house a few times since I’ve been dating him and they both still seemed just as nice as ever. Last night we attended his cousin’s wedding. It was the first big family function of theirs I attended as his girlfriend. When we first got to the reception hall their dad made a big deal out of us walking in holding hands. He’s one of those dads who’s always making corny jokes and is just the sweetest guy. He came up to us and jokingly asked me “You know you can do better than this guy, don’t you?” I told him I didn’t think I could. Later in the evening when my boyfriend went to get us drinks I was sitting with his parents. His mom said “So. You and Robbie, huh?” She always calls him Robbie and he hates it. I said “Yeah, I think he’s just the greatest.” Or something like that. She told me she thinks it’s adorable that we got together and that we make the cutest couple. His dad chimes in that we’re half a cute couple. Then he gets all serious and says that they both think I’m a wonderful young woman and there’s no one else they’d rather see their son dating! I actually felt like crying. I think the world of their family and it feels so good to hear them say something like this to me. Then his mom squeezed my hand and said “Robbie really couldn’t have done any better for himself.” Ok.

The fact that I was able to fall asleep so quickly in the middle of the day with him makes me so happy. Hearing his slow breathing and being all wrapped up is so comforting. There’s really nothing like it. I feel so lucky. These impromptu naps have happened only a few times, and I look back on every one of them so fondly. It’s such a rare moment of letting go & relaxing for me and I love that I can have those moments with someone I love so much. So, yeah. Love is naps. This is my first post here and personal post on Reddit in general!! My partner is also the one who introduced me to Reddit. I hope you see this, JAM. :)"},

Then we were just standing looking at each other, and then she says \"Kiss me, you fool\". God, it was sooooooooooooo amazing. It was so great that it feels like I've been dreaming.

{"Title": "To The Person Who Overthinks In Their Relationship", "Author": "u/butteryflakeycrust-", "Content": "It’s not your fault. You never chose to be this way. You didn't choose to be an over thinker. You wish you didn't have to re-read or take a second to think about what they said. Their words never seem to come out as hurtful but to you, the over thinker ; they are and they always will be. You try your best not to over analyze the things they say but it never works. You take what is said and make the worst of it. When something of minor inconvenience takes hold, it isn't just minor anymore. It engulfs your entire mind to the point where you are overthinking everything. Every Last Thing . You start to question everything about the relationship. You let your emotions take over and conquer you. You’re worried, aren't you? You’re worried that one day your overthinking will be too much and they will leave just like everyone else, right? You don’t mean to be clingy . You don't want to become a burden that you think you’re becoming to them. So what do you do? You overthink . You doubt their love for you is as strong as yours. How could they love you the same? As an over thinker you question everything. You’re worried about them wanting to be with someone else like when they take too long to respond. “ They must have found someone else” . As a result; you respond right away because you've been waiting for their response for hours.. You assume that they were talking to someone better. Your mind takes you into a state of emergency of overthinking. Telling you only the wrong things you don't need to hear. When they’re too busy to see you, it auto corrects in your mind as “they do not want to see me”. Any simple texts can turn into a roller coaster full of over thinking emotions. Now from everything i've addressed.. Forget about it and take a minute to process what i’m about to say. Don’t go back and re-read what they said.. You have nothing to worry about. Do not doubt their love for you, that hurts their feelings. They just have different ways of showing love than you do.You are not a burden to them, they just have a busy life on top of your relationship. They do love you as much as you do. They haven't responded in a while? Be patient, they want to talk to you they are just busy. When they are too busy to see you, don't take it personally; understand that they will make time when they can. They are trying. So try to understand from their point of view as well. So please do not overthink about your relationship, it isn't healthy for you or your partner. How do I know this? Because I have felt the same things.. I have been anxious about not getting a text back in a certain amount of time. I have thought they didn’t love me anymore because of little things they say. But with that being said, I'm learning (have learned) to not let it control me as much as it used to… Just remember Everything will be okay, just breathe. Sincerely, A person who overthinks in their relationship"},

I’ve finished chemo 2 1/2 months ago, and I’ve just now started to look a bit more like a human being, lol. Seeing how I looked over the past few months breaks my heart, honestly. I wasn’t doing too bad physically all things considered, but holy shit, I looked like I was from a different species at times. Deep bags under my eyes, blue lips, yellow skin, bald, eyebrows gone… picture a naked mole rat on the brink of death and yeah, that’s exactly what I looked like at times. And yet, my boyfriend constantly made me feel like the sun shined out of my bald ass. Frankly speaking, I have no idea how we have managed to have an active sex life while I was going through treatment, but he didn’t make it look difficult at all. Mind you, this is not a long relationship: I am 23, he’s 25, and we’ve been together for just a bit over 6 months now. We’ve met while I was going through treatment: I never would’ve started a relationship in those circumstances, but he made it seem like the easiest, most natural thing. He has known about my condition from the very start, and he has never been intimidated by it. If anything, I feel like it makes him love me even more. My last boyfriend broke up with me due to cancer, so this is such a huge deal for me. He takes care of me with such kindness and patience, I don’t know how he does it. He has never made me feel like a burden in the slightest. Whenever I feel bad, either physically or mentally, he just showers me with a seemingly infinite supply of love and care. I can’t believe I am lucky enough to have someone like him in my life. Staying alive is so hard at times, but it becomes easy when I think of those in my life who want me to stay alive. If my cancer ever recurs, I’ll take any treatment with a smile on my face for more time with those I love, him especially. With how hard it’s been at times, I feel like staying alive and sane is the biggest act of love I have to give. I didn’t think men like him existed, especially after my last boyfriend - but they do. If any of you reading this ever feel like you’re too much for anyone to love, take me as living (for now, LOL) proof that there’s someone out there for you. The right person will think that what was “too much” for someone else is just right for them."},

{"Title": "My boyfriend keeps making me coffees that I can barely keep down but I will \"gladly\" keep drinking them", "Author": "u/thepieintheoven", "Content": "When I was younger my mom used to make what she would call \"children's coffee\", which was essentially heated soy milk (I'm lactose intolerant) mixed with a bit of instant coffee powder. One day while my bf and I were at my parents' house, I asked my mom to make me this \"children's coffee\" and my boyfriend asked me what that was and I explained the story behind it and how I used to drink it a lot when I was younger. That's where it all began. Ffw a few weeks, we're at his mom's house and for a change there's soy milk in the fridge there (leftover from a family holiday we went on) so he asks me if I want children's coffee. Surprised, I asked him if he wanted to make it for me and he said yes. So obviously I agreed, it's a cute gesture. And it was good. Better than my mom's, even. Which is what I told him too. I guess from that point on it became his go-to act of service, because every single day when we're together he asks me if I want children's coffee, sometimes more than once a day too. Every time I say yes, because I can tell it makes him happy to make the coffees. But here's the problem: his recipe tastes HORRIBLE with almond milk. At least the almond milk we have at my parents' house. My mom does not want soy milk in her house because of the estrogen, so this substitute is the only thing my bf could use for the coffee, but man it tastes bad. I'm talking \"the flavor gives me a nauseated feeling if I drink more than half of it\" kind of bad. Still, every time he prepares it for me in the morning, I force myself to drink it all. I've asked him to switch up the recipe a bit to accommodate for the different milk substitute, but it's like no matter what he does, each time it ends up tasting worse. But whenever he hands me that coffee mug with a proud smile on his face it's like he just handed me a cup of love, how could I not drink that? There are many ways to get out of this situation. I am not afraid of being honest. I could easily tell him it just doesn't taste good with almond milk and he will not get upset. But I don't want to. I don't want him to stop doing this. It's almost like the bad flavor makes it better/sweeter? Sometimes I even consider asking him myself if he wants to make me that coffee, knowing it will taste bad. I guess that's just how love works."},

You made me smile, laugh, cry, FEEL, for the first time in years. We had passion, chemistry, connection, intellectual conversation, fun, mind blowing sex. Our relationship was beautiful and has so much potential to be beautiful for a long time. You are so smart, kind, fit, happy, self aware, full of self love and love for others. You set boundaries better than any person I have ever met. All of which are aspects of you that I truly admire. I had learned, and still have so much to learn, from you. In our time together, you made me a better man, a better human, a better partner. You challenged me in so many ways - I miss this. I miss you. I’m in love with you. There is no other way to say it. I don’t see a scenario in which that changes anytime soon. I left M for me. I’m not drinking nearly as much as I was. I have my support system in place. I’m exercising every day. I’m in therapy.

{"Title": "What's the difference between loving someone and being IN love with them?", "Author": "u/SunfireElfAmaya", "Content": "I'm 19NB and have been trying to understand the difference. Like, I get loving someone—you appreciate who they are, you enjoy being around them, you feel loved and safe with them etc—but how does that differ from being in love with them ie loving them romantically not platonically? For example, your best friend vs your romantic partner, you love both of them but other than (presumably) also being sexually attracted to your partner and not to your friend (would also appreciate if anyone has advice on what that actually means, is it literally looking at someone and having a desire to have sex with them?), is there a difference in how you feel about them? I feel like there has to be since I know that there are plenty of asexual people or people who just otherwise aren't interested in sex who still fall in love and differentiate between romantic and platonic relationships, so clearly being \"in love\" with someone is different than just loving them. So what does being \"in love\" actually feel like?"},

We hadn’t been together for very long, just a couple months, but we both knew it was very different from anything else we had experienced. We had unashamed conversations of marriage, children, homes, issues, exes, strengths, weaknesses and just what life would be like together. It felt so right, but not in a rose colored glasses way, in a very raw and vulnerable way. One night we were at my house and we were drinking a little bit of wine, we went out to look at the stars and have a little smoke. We were in the middle of a silly conversation and he did a totally random 180 to ask me about what kind of tree growth my woods were (he works in forestry!). I laughed so hard and let the I love you I had been holding on the tip of my tongue for weeks slip. He just laughed along with me and the night continued without mention of what I said. The next day rolls around and this part of the story gets a little confusing but I’ll give the short version. Basically I had a friend who was friends with my partners ex girlfriend. That friend (m) liked to tell me(f) all the negative details of my partners past relationship. I hear another story from this friend and shoot my partner a text. (just to clarify we had been openly communicating about his previous relationship from day one prior to my friends input, as well as all of my previous relationships). I tell him that i heard more from my friend and would like to talk. He comes right over even though i was just expecting a phone call. After we talked everything through we go outside again to let the dogs out. He starts apologizing for putting me through all of this drama because he knows it’s not really enjoyable for anyone involved. We talk a bit more and I just tell him that it’s okay, and I trust him, and that our relationship is what we make it and these things don’t have to influence us negatively, they can build us up. He says “I think I love you.”, and I tell him that “I know I love you.”…. A day or two later we’re talking about it and HE NEVER HEARD MY I LOVE YOU FROM THE PREVIOUS NIGHT!!! He thought he was saying it first and I thought I had said it first. I just find that to be the cutest thing. Neither of us were afraid of taking that first step. Everything was perfectly balanced and it makes me feel incredibly happy to think about. He is my person. Thank you for reading♥️"},

I just moved here and was feeling a bit nostalgic, so I decided to check out a few local restaurants to ask about job openings. I figured finding something to do at night a party from my day job would help me settle in. After a few stops, I found this place called Le Colonial, which is a cool mix of Vietnamese and French cuisine. It really caught my eye. Inside, I met someone who really stood out. The manager—a young blonde with the most striking blue eyes I’ve ever seen—initially threw me off because I thought she was the hostess! After a quick chat, I left, but I couldn't stop thinking about her. So, 15 to 20 minutes later, I walked back in, pretending I needed a business card, but honestly, I just wanted to see her again and ask her out. When I asked her out, she seemed pleasantly surprised and genuinely happy, even though she mentioned she had a boyfriend. Her warm smile didn’t stop me. I took the business card, smiled back, and hinted that I’d be back. Boyfriend or not, I felt a connection I couldn't ignore. Hopefully, she’s not getting married anytime soon!

I just wanted to understand why people like girls a certain way my gf is beautiful the most gorgeous girl I know but she has a few things that aren’t considered the beauty standard that’s she’s insecure about and I hate that people make it feel like you need to be a certain way just bc someone’s hips or ribs are a little wider or if they are a little chubby or are short or tall I don’t understand why others care? Those aren’t my gfs insecurities but I’m not gonna share those to random people I just wanted to understand why people are so mean I love my gf but other people have made fun of me and treated her bad I’ve gotten in fights bc of it I just wanna know why people are so mean can they just not judge me for who I wanna love and make her feel bad she’s literally the love of me life like people need to grow up.

He was forced now to work part time as well and began to reply late and he apologized saying he was busy working full time and part time. I get that he was busy but i know him so well that i know he seems depressed although he didn't say anything to me. So, although i was not feeling it and was slightly hurt he really replies late, I still gave him a long message thanking him and letting him know i'm always here for him and that these things may have happened to him but I consoled him and told him that the Lord has better plans for him. I even told him sweet things like thanks for being a blessing etc. but he has yet to respond. I have a rough idea that he is going through something but I thought my message will cheer him up. I swear my message I anticipate would touch him and make him cry but I guess not? He is an emotional person and very caring towards me so this is odd that he is not responding even to say thanks. He even acts like my boyfriend sometimes and supports me emotionally."},

She even decided to name me her best man (or man of honor) whenever she gets married.  That's honestly one of the greatest honors to be given and I appreciate it a great deal.  I still love her to this day, at least as a person (not romantically, but platonically).  I learned she was my platonic soulmate since December 2023, though did take me time to confirm it and share with her. I have made many friends online, but this one in particular is unlike any other I have made.  The fact I learned she is my platonic soulmate makes it more special.  Even though I know how to find my own happiness; it's great to have someone be a special addition like her.  It's incredible to know someone who thinks on a very similar wavelength, able to connect very quickly, very similar values, etc.  Again, I appreciate her a great deal. 🥰 If you have one or more platonic soulmates you truly appreciate, feel free to share. 😉"},

I keep thinking about having sex with other girls all the time. I used to be a womanizer before being with her, and after two years I wanna go back to it. Sometimes I masturbate seeing other girls instagrams and thinking about other girls. We haven't had sex for a month now, Im just not in the mood to have sex with her. I really love her and we get along but im not sexually satisfied, im just used to having sex with a lot of girls and not just one, I never cheated on her and never will. The problem is she is SUPPER attached to me, I don't wanna hurt her, she would cry a lot and financially she is not very good.

I don't wanna make her unhappy and her to cry but at this point I am in the relationship because of her well being and not because of mine, I can't stop thinking about finishing the relationship not even for one day for the last 4 months. I don't know what to do. If I tell her that I wanna finish and tell her to get another apartment she would not leave. She can't afford this apartment that we are living now, I can afford it even being alone. She can't, so she would need to move to a cheaper place by herself, but she wont want to finish and when she starts crying im gonna feel bad and get back with her... it happened once before, I tried leaving her but I just felt so guilty seeing her crying so I stayed. I just wanna experience what is to be single again. Maybe Im just not made for relationships... what should I do? help )': TLDR: I want but I emotionally can't leave my girlfriend even though im not happy. Live together, lease finishes in 1 year, I was thinking on waiting until then to part ways separate but im just no happy, I wanna experience to be single again."},

During the next two failed relationships, he was somewhat correct; I felt I had fumbled the one man I had an authentic, non-forced romantic relationship with to try and force relationships with men who weren’t truly in love with me or compatible. During the most recent failed relationship, I told myself that at 30, I had to settle for a less-than-ideal relationship, because I had already experienced one relationship with a man who was head over heels for me. In my early 30s, I’m in a relationship where I feel secure and where my partner regularly approves he genuinely adores me. Nothing was forced, everything progressed naturally. I’m a more mature and emotionally independent person than I was when I was engaged; that relationship was doomed to fail because of my own immaturity, toxicity and codependence, but that doesn’t mean what I experienced then wasn’t true love, nor does it detract from the love I’m experiencing now. I feel lucky to have experienced this sort of love at all, let alone twice."},

I don’t think i could live life without him anymore; if something were to happen i’d hope we could remain friends.:)🫶"},

Sometimes it’s like I’m looking into a mirror we are so alike but we are also so different I can’t explain it. Most days consist of me getting off work and going to either her place or mine where she will be waiting for me. Then we go to the gym and either cook or get food. After that it’s yk what time then we shower and watch tv together. It’s so simple and mundane but so meaningful. I can talk to her about anything and she just gets me and vice versa. She is the most beautiful amazing woman I’ve ever met and I’m so excited for our future. We will be moving in together near the end of the summer and I haven’t been this excited for anything in so long. She’s already started picking out decorations and furniture; it’s so adorable. She tells me she loves me at least 50 times a day. We’re both young and started supporting ourselves younger than most so it’s so nice to be with someone who understands the challenges that comes with. I would do anything for this girl.

Sunday I was exhausted after getting home after it , swollen feet , and sleep deprived . Monday became a Monday for no reason, and it hit like a tidal wave .  I cleaned my car out and vacuumed it out . My dad was being annoying bc he just had to see how good of a job I did on my own car . He wanted to \" Inspect \" it . I said no your not seeing the inside of my car , I bought it and pay for it . He returned with being petty and on my case about stuff . I asked him where I could get my state inspection done , he wasn't a help . Every Monday is trash day .... he is an odd ball about it . I did the dishes after dinner and I apparently had to take the trash out asap .  I was over his attitude mostly. It hit me the wrong way , and then my bf ... I wanted to see him . I offered to get dinner and drinks and I didn't get a response till later on . It was too late to go out with him bc my dad was also making dinner at the time . I was just over the whole day , and I was still exhausted.  I got to see my bf today for lunch on his break , and it was nice . Last night I just bawled.  I bawled like a baby , bc I was over the wedding stuff , my ex husband didn't want to do a huge thing for us getting married, and I guess again grieving in a way .

He offered to spend time with me this weekend as well,  and tomorrow night.  Sometimes , I forget that I have someone who actually cares and loves me . I felt a disconnect from him, but I over think . My gut feelings weren't screaming,  just my heart was aching . I really was sad and mad at the world .

For a little context we both had really damaging long relationships before meeting. My husband was abusive and passed away and his ex seems to have been verbally and mentally abusive toward him. (I only know his side of the story but he included his wrongs when telling me about their past). All I can do is laugh right now about how I’ve reverted to high school girl mentality over this man. My brain is writing our names with little hearts all over notebooks."},

They'd understand it and take it in subconsciously. I used to sneak into my dads room and whisper to him that he should buy me new toys. Fun times. Nowadays I don't know if I believe it. But when my boyfriend is asleep I like to whisper things to him. I tell him how amazing he is, how beautiful he is. Sometimes I just tell him he should be proud of himself, or he is really good at his hobbies or job. The other day he got his 8th platinum achievement on PlayStation and when he was asleep I kept going on about how cool he was, that he is awesome at video games and he can definitely make it to 10 (his goal) He wakes up sometimes, laughs a bit and gives me a cuddle. Never remembers it in the morning. I don't know if it works. But I hope it does. Because he deserves to know how amazing he is. EDIT : I am a man. We are gay. I am not a woman 👍"},

And his perfect body that I love to cuddle up against and hug so tightly. He loves me for who I am, and never asks me to change. Always so respectful of what I want and need. I know he'd do anything for me, just like I'd do absolutely anything for him. He's perfect, and the day I met him is the happiest day of my life. Love you baby 💚"},

Two of the least toxic relationships I had still weren’t healthy, one because he sold drugs and I was a 17 year old with a drug problem due to being homeless and the second was addicted to ketamine so it came with problems, but they were both nice to me. Every other relationship I have been in as been abusive. I’ve been with narcissists, people who’ve emotionally, physically and sexually abusive to me. For the last few months I’ve been dating a lovely man. Not a drug addict, looks like a model, he’s sooo kind and respectful of women, owns his own business, never shouts or takes his anger out on me. Shows me love and affection. I met him through one of my friends of 16 years who has vetted him and told him he’s good for me and tried to set us up. He accepts me whole heartedly and is supportive. My mum passed away and he supported me all the way through it and came to the funeral, he’s generous with me and showers me with adoration and wants to spend as much time with me as possible. One of my close friends told my other friend, I’m looking forward to meeting him because he seems good for her. This other friend also knew of him, he said “he had a healthy relationship with with his ex, but (my name) has only been in toxic relationships” it made me feel that most people think I’m at fault for being abused in relationships. I feel relieved that I’ll be in a healthy relationship and won’t be victim blamed or villainised for the abuse I’ve endured, this will be the relationship that maybe will wake people up that I’m not the problem other than condoning it for too long. I feel so lucky to have found such a loving kind person after living a lifetime with the opposite. 🙏"},

I got so lucky to meet someone as amazing as my partner 🥰", "Author": "u/Traditional_Set_858", "Content": "So l was definitely a late bloomer as I only had one very short term boyfriend at 22 and I wouldn't even consider that relationship experience because it really wasn't like a relationship at all. It wasn't until I was 25 when I finally decided to put myself out there as I really wanted to experience being in love as I had never experienced it. I eventually caved and downloaded Tinder and literally within 2 weeks I had met my amazing partner and went on our first date and a week later we were officially a couple. It was completely out of character for me to go so quickly into a relationship but it just felt natural and it was one of those things where it just felt right to take the chance. We've now been together for a year and a half and I definitely can say I found my person. We not only have similar interests but we get along so well and really understand each other. He does everything he can to make sure I'm happy in the relationship and occasionally asks if there's any issues or concerns I have. He does little things for me like take out the trash, surprise me with little things like Starbucks, or offers to get me food delivered if I'm not feeling well. He also took me to his home country and I got to meet his family and I just felt so welcomed and it was so nice to see where he grew up. I never thought l'd love someone so much that I'm willing to spend a little time everyday learning a new language. It literally feels like I won the lottery with this man as I can't believe that not only was he single when I met him but that he chose me out everyone else. Even though I definitely wish we would have met sooner in life he was definitely worth the wait."},

He came for my prom and when I say I’ve never felt so in love I mean it. The whole time I felt like we were the only people there and I couldn’t stop looking at him. He was so affectionate and calling me perfect and “more beautiful in person” and be was so patient about everything including our first kiss, which made me like him 1000x more. I think we touched foreheads about 5 times trying to go for the first kiss but I kept backing out LOL. After the first one, the rest were so easy. He was complimenting me all night and hugging me every second and kissing all over my forehead and cheek and neck but I loved that I could tell it was endearing and not sexual. Like I literally FELT the affection radiating off of him. On the dance floor we were hugging and I was leaning back on him and he just stayed there for me even tho he HATES dancing and swore off of it. He spent 60% of the night there for me, which I’m very grateful for. His smile was so genuine and he would look at me and ask for a kiss over and over it was so cute dude. Everything physical he took his time w, which btw didnt go far but like what we did do he was so gentle with and asked “can I……..” “yes or no?” I found it so adorable in the moment. ik it’s bare minimum but it’s just a relief and honestly blessing knowing he cares how I feel in the moment and thinks about me when he’s horny ig? 😭 Like seriously, even our tongue kiss was so gentle. I was so nervous and he was like “for one second, I’ll teach you,” and not in a demanding way but more question and care. I did it and then did it 1-2 more times for a couple seconds and got embarrassed and dug my head into his chest bc I thought I was doing really bad, and then I just like mumbled “I don’t know what to do or how to do it..” and he reassured me the second after and was saying “nooooo it was good….baby it was perfect, I swear.” and I was blushing the WHOLE TIME. Anyways, after the bus ride back and cute I just kinda laid on his shoulder and almost passed out on his lap bc I was so exhausted and we took a drive to Dave and busters but he had to leave early, sadly. I think one of the cutest things was him saying “the pictures please, the PhotoBooth and card” bc I had taken a picture for us and made us save each others table cards and him remembering and saying it in the actual most adorable voice, not like a baby but like imagine a grown man or deep voiced guy just saying it so softly. Then he said I love you and I’ll miss you and we kissed goodbye 🙁. Now, I’m going to his house in a week or two for his pool and we’re gonna have fun in there there watch a movie together and cuddle in our matching pjs and build a lego set I bought us. I’m so happy so have stuck through the long year of petty fights and lack of touch bc it was all worth it. Our 15 months is in 6 days, it feels surreal. I’m gonna marry this man, mark my words."},

{"Title": "My Fiancé Stole $40 From Me… But It’s Not What You Think.", "Author": "u/New_Sea344", "Content": "It’s not what you think. This happened early on in our relationship, a little under four years ago. When we met my guy was starting his recovery from a serious meth addiction and as you can imagine I didn’t want to be involved with that, at all. So even though we had a serious connection I kept turning him down because I didn’t want to take any chances there, but after about six months of getting to know him I finally broke down and kissed him. We got together, and things were great. Then about six more months into our relationship there was one bad day where he wasn’t acting like himself and he was out hanging out with some guys I didn’t know, and I ended up finding $40 missing from my bank account. When I confronted him about it he admitted what he’d done. And I took my time to think about what that meant to me, because obviously I couldn’t just ignore what had happened. I definitely wasn’t going to just sit there and let him do things like that, to me or to himself. I wasn’t going to be an enabler and I wasn’t going to tie myself to that. So I took him and sat him down. And I explained that I knew he was recovering from a serious addiction and because of that I was going to forgive him for what had happened. And I also explained that I would give him two years. I wouldn’t commit to anything serious in that time, but if he could stay completely clean and sober it would show me that he was serious about our relationship. And to show him I was just as serious, I said that if he could do that, I would marry him. Now, four years later, he’s still completely sober and we’re engaged and I can say without a doubt that giving him a second chance that night was absolutely the best decision I have ever made. He is the love of my life. He never hesitates to tell me how beautiful I am or how much he loves me, and when I’m feeling bad he always does everything he possibly can to make me feel better. He is my world."},

We each have a computer in here, and there is also a bed for napping. Just before I moved here two months ago, he set up Apple Home using Siri. One of Siri's skills is to play music all over the house when we ask her to. As we are both working at our computers, listening to music, the song \"In the Arms of the Angels\" starts to play. My wonderful, loving partner knew that song would trigger intense grief in me and make me cry. As soon as it started playing, he stood up, came to my computer, put his arms around me and said, \"Come on, let's go snuggle.\" I was already crying. My partner led me to the bed, pulled me into his arms, told Siri to stop the music, held me, and talked to me about my son until I stopped crying. I have never felt so loved.

{"Title": "I find emotional intimacy difficult in many ways.

But then on the other those very same individuals get too scared/timid to actually let others in on real emotionally intimate level. How can someone be loved unconditionally if they don't show who they truly are to others? When I say this I mean, their fears, insecurities, and doubts in the moment as well as the positives. So many go out their way to protect their own ego that they hurt those willing to want to love them for who they are. I do think a lot is because of issues with perfectionism and what it means to be attractive. It's scary to actually put yourself truly on the line like that. But by doing so makes you a fantasticaslly strong individual. To accept and understand that you are a perfectly imperfect individual takes a lot of strength, and through that strength is being vulnerable you can have a chance at unconditional love.

{"Title": "For 30 Years, I loved with contempt. My ex wife despised me.", "Author": "u/saffermaster", "Content": "After a few years licking my wounds, I put myself out there at age 55, trying to find love. I spent 4 years enjoying kinky sex with women of every age. From 18 to 60. Nothing I did could fill the emptiness I felt in my broken heart. One woman I dated shared with me that in spite of my sense of failure, that she found me imminently lovable. Another lover told me that I am too distant and \"You need to let me in,\" I went out and got a tattoo on my chest that took 7 months to complete. It captured my sense that attraction was possible, that there was a certain randomity to the world, that we lived in an endless universe and that I am lovable. Its a cool trash punk tattoo. I looked hard at what was missing from my marriage. It occurred to me that intimacy was missing. One day I got a message from a woman on a kink site who saw my \"seeking post\". She was as kinky as me and also looking for intimacy and we started a dialogue. We courted for 6 months before we began our dynamic formally. That was 6 years ago. in 6 days I am going to marry her. I could not be happier. We not only found love, we fell in love and have had a steamy love affair that goes on and on. I am so here for it. Its possible to find love. I can guarantee that there is love after divorce. My life is poetry. Update: Kink is interesting. People of all ages participate. There are kids who learn about kink at a very young age, and are perhaps more ready to explore kink when they get to age 18 than others are till much later in life. One thing about being Dom in a kink setting like a club or munch is that submissives of all ages and genders approach you and negotiate a scene with you. Remember, all kink is based on consent, not persuasion, informed enthusiastic consent. I should have noted that I practice RACK which is Risk-Aware Consensual Kink, and SSC, Safe, Sane Consensual Kink. I get the idea that morality has it that young adults should not play with old adults, but that is simply your own ick, nobody else's. We have a saying in kink, \"I'm not going to yuck on your yum\""},

I look at the casual photos I love taking of her and I think she’s so sexy, so inspiring, so beautiful, and so intelligent. She’s off the radar bro. She’s crazy to think she’s ugly if she really believes that. I seriously love this women. I love to see her laugh. I love when it’s me making her laugh. I love the way she walks. I even love when she’s nagging, I don’t mean it in any disrespectful way. For example, when she tries to convince me to take cab home instead of walking home at night and she’s super serious but I still decide to walk home, because overall I live like 15 blocks away lol. I love her nose. I love her big eyes. I love her hair. I love her forehead. I love the smudged oval  birthmark on the right side of her face. I love when shes eating. I love her fingernails. I love her toes. I love her belly. I love her family to because they are good people. I love when the hairs on her legs are growing. I love her kisses when she use to give me some. I super love her hugs and when it lasts for more than 10 seconds. I love her style. I love her charisma. I love how funny she is. I love her principles. I love her dog. I literally can go on and on. I love how she just a boss. I love her being anal about having matching sheets. I love how she’s always trying to evolve. From upgrading her standard toothbrush to an electric one 😭 or just taking care of herself and her needs. Shit I love she broke up with me because I totally respect that and respect her. At this point, i think I can care less if she gets back with me. It would hurt, yes, if she decided to move on entirely and we don’t talk anymore but part of me is just so grateful to be in her presence still and show her, even though we are friends, how much I still appreciate her. I can never convince myself things I hate about her. I’m here for her until whenever. I won’t let her go. I wish I was Superman and I could sweep her off her feet and fly her out of earth and show her the stars and planets. I will try my best to show it every chance I get to show and prove to her. I Need to use my brain and show her it’s more than the dates, the past sex, etc. I really can’t explain it but I just love the time she gives me, the care she had for me, everything yo.

We made our relationship official in April, so I like to think we took it pretty slow. In every other relationship I have ever had, I felt the need to be so careful about my body, my choices, and never felt at home with my partners. I always was waiting for the next step of where I was going to go to next. I made sure that we used multiple forms of protection when we were intimate. I never felt like I could be my sensitive, extroverted self fully. Before we became romantic, he helped me pass the final course I needed for my first degree. I had been calling my \"Rave Husband\", because we were always attached at the hip at the many raves we stuffed into a year. He spent the day with me after I had emergency surgery, just so I wouldn't be alone. He is one of the only people that has ever made an effort to celebrate my birthday. He got out of his car when I did, because he thought he was going to have to pull me off of some guy in front of a bar, and still decided to want me. He watched me projectile vomit outside of a show in 100 degree weather, and left early with me, and cuddled me while I looked like a drowned sewer rat months long before he declared his feelings. With this man??? I told this man today that I trust him enough to decide when and if he ever wants to put a baby in me. I told this man that I would provide for him whatever he desires in this world and then more. I made this man know I intend on marrying him and making sure that he smiles every day for the rest of his life. I let this man do things to me today that I would have never allowed anyone else do. Suddenly, just like magic, I would give him everything I am and still be searching for more to give him. Every day, I find out more about him that makes my love grow even bigger. I sat in my bedroom for hours today waiting for him to call on his work break, in shock with myself at the words that had come out of my mouth to him before he had left. Never in my life have I been down this bad for someone. Every day it gets worse. I grieve for the time in this life that I won't get to spend with him. I have never wanted to just spend a day laying around with someone. It's like I have been possessed. Somehow, I have known my best friend for over a year now and the love I have for him only continues to grow exponentially with time that I fear I may one day explode. SOS"},

Why aren’t we trying to reconcile this? I mean we’re friends still so is that what that is? You said you were firm in your decision in not getting back with me. I try not to let it bother me; not cling to our little memories we had and not push away the fact you may over and done with me. I’m trying to experience the gift of life without fighting it. Yet my will is strong in not letting you go. New beginnings? Why do I feel that you’re going to eventually leave me once you find discover a new connection? It’s ideal. Is our friendship ideal?. Wishes of my life in order so that we can shine in gold and sparkle in the night time. We take it all off and we still shine. I’m sorry I ever pursued you and I wasn’t ready yet I don’t feel bad, how could I be? You allowed me to feel a feeling I never felt before. I  wish you can run to me when your heart feels heavy and lean your head on my shoulder. We had sex once after the break up and I wish you wanted my love more than you lust for sex at the moment? Is that a valid statement to say? Maybe you do want my love but baby I want all of you not just part of you. Please come home and sit still inside me because I would hate to see you come and go. Until you find someone new… I’ll be here… until you find someone new Ill be here. I just wanted to make you know how I feel although it may bug you I’m overthinking. I just wish things were different. I know you may feel different. I love you for it regardless. I love to see you prosper with or without me. It hurts but baby I’m here in the back of the ceremony rooting for you, so happy for you, I know your eyes are fixed on someone new and other things so you don’t notice me and that’s fine, here I am, happy for your accomplishments. I will forever love you as long as I know who I am and the love I have experienced. I will always pray for you and your family as I have been doing. Thank you for reading this. You don’t have to talk about anything I said. Sincerely, the boy who dreams countless lucid dreams and with you by my side, for infinity. Give me your hand and let me put a ring on it, forever kiss it. I can never break this bond even when you come crashing like thunderstorms from the southern states to the Great Plains."},

{"Title": "I love my boyfriend so much it hurts. He makes me so happy.", "Author": "u/sheerest_of_folly", "Content": "I know not many people will likely care to read my rant, but I love this man so fucking much. We’ve been dating for almost 3 years (anniversary in July). For 2.5 of them, we were online. Online relationships are hard. He’s in South Carolina, I was in Maryland. I decided to move to him. On the way down, on January 31st, literally 40 minutes away, my mom fell asleep at the wheel and we crashed into the moving van (she was going to drop me off, as she herself was moving to Florida with my youngest sibling. Other sibling stayed with Dad in Maryland for college.) I was the only one moderately injured in the wreck (thank God) and was taken to the hospital in an ambulance. I told my boyfriend where. He met me there. I saw my boyfriend in person for the first time while on a hospital bed. The first few months were rough for me to settle in. 21 years in Maryland in the same area my whole life was hard to transition from. My boyfriend was with me every step of the way. March was the anniversary of the deaths of several people who were important to me in my youth. They died in a car crash when I was a young teen. In Maryland, every year I would go to the playground we all played at on their deathiversary, since none of them were buried (all cremated to my knowledge). My boyfriend drove me the 500 miles to go back to Maryland to be at that playground. In April, I had a breast reduction surgery. The recovery for that was rough— for the first two weeks, I couldn’t reach my middle well enough to use the bathroom. This man wiped my pee for me, and once the anesthesia wore off, my poop too. I got my period in the second week. He learned how to put a tampon in me and take it out. He was by my side the whole time. The breast reduction was done in Maryland and we stayed with my father for a week. I’ve only seen my father cry three times: when our cat died, at the end of Star Wars (because “it’s so happy, they got the medals they worked so hard for” 💀), and when my boyfriend and I left. My father said he’s a good man and he’s so happy for us. He also gave him $400 to “pay him back” for medical expenses. My boyfriend ended up using the remainder on a date with me. Speaking of dates. I love notebooks and pens; my boyfriend doesn’t really care about those. Yet he took me on a date to Staples and Michaels, I thought to window shop but he bought so much for me. He also gets me some model skulls that I collect when he sees a cool one. Shortly after I moved in, he came home with one meant for an aquarium: “I thought of you.” I cried. We went to MomoCon this year, and he cosplayed with me. We went as Leon and Ada from the Resident Evil series (specifically the RE4 remake). He waited in line for Digimon and Pokémon voice actors with me and listened to me rant about the characters I like. We’re getting married next year. We aren’t conventionally engaged yet— he has something planned but won’t tell me— but we know we’re getting married. We just haven’t told our families yet. I’m so fucking excited and happy that this is the man I get to spend my life with."},

I’ve finished chemo 2 1/2 months ago, and I’ve just now started to look a bit more like a human being, lol. Seeing how I looked over the past few months breaks my heart, honestly. I wasn’t doing too bad physically all things considered, but holy shit, I looked like I was from a different species at times. Deep bags under my eyes, blue lips, yellow skin, bald, eyebrows gone… picture a naked mole rat on the brink of death and yeah, that’s exactly what I looked like at times. And yet, my boyfriend constantly made me feel like the sun shined out of my bald ass. Frankly speaking, I have no idea how we have managed to have an active sex life while I was going through treatment, but he didn’t make it look difficult at all. Mind you, this is not a long relationship: I am 23, he’s 25, and we’ve been together for just a bit over 6 months now. We’ve met while I was going through treatment: I never would’ve started a relationship in those circumstances, but he made it seem like the easiest, most natural thing. He has known about my condition from the very start, and he has never been intimidated by it. If anything, I feel like it makes him love me even more. My last boyfriend broke up with me due to cancer, so this is such a huge deal for me. He takes care of me with such kindness and patience, I don’t know how he does it. He has never made me feel like a burden in the slightest. Whenever I feel bad, either physically or mentally, he just showers me with a seemingly infinite supply of love and care. I can’t believe I am lucky enough to have someone like him in my life. Staying alive is so hard at times, but it becomes easy when I think of those in my life who want me to stay alive. If my cancer ever recurs, I’ll take any treatment with a smile on my face for more time with those I love, him especially. With how hard it’s been at times, I feel like staying alive and sane is the biggest act of love I have to give. I didn’t think men like him existed, especially after my last boyfriend - but they do. If any of you reading this ever feel like you’re too much for anyone to love, take me as living (for now, LOL) proof that there’s someone out there for you. The right person will think that what was “too much” for someone else is just right for them."},

You made me smile, laugh, cry, FEEL, for the first time in years. We had passion, chemistry, connection, intellectual conversation, fun, mind blowing sex. Our relationship was beautiful and has so much potential to be beautiful for a long time. You are so smart, kind, fit, happy, self aware, full of self love and love for others. You set boundaries better than any person I have ever met. All of which are aspects of you that I truly admire. I had learned, and still have so much to learn, from you. In our time together, you made me a better man, a better human, a better partner. You challenged me in so many ways - I miss this. I miss you. I’m in love with you. There is no other way to say it. I don’t see a scenario in which that changes anytime soon. I left M for me. I’m not drinking nearly as much as I was. I have my support system in place. I’m exercising every day. I’m in therapy.

{"Title": "My girlfriend said something that made me want to cry because it was exactly what I was about to thank her for", "Author": "Unknown author", "Content": "So I (M22) have OCD, I was diagnosed at 14 but it’s something I’ve struggled with my whole life. One of my symptoms is hand washing (long, long before the pandemic started—I’m talking 10+ years). I wash my hands constantly to the point where they get red, dry, and the skin starts cracking. I use lotion when it gets bad but it usually doesn’t work, sometimes it provides temporary relief but I’ve pretty much accepted that my hands will always be like this. The effects on my skin are usually worse in the wintertime, but people ask me all the time why my hands are so red and why they’re so dry and I absolutely hate it. I struggle with this everyday, the compulsions of “if I don’t wash my hands right now, something bad will happen” and it’s not really an easy thing to explain to people because a lot of people see OCD as something they can just diagnose themselves because they “like to keep things organized” I could go on and on about my problem with that statement, as someone who struggles with OCD everyday—but that’s not where I’m here. Last night me and my girlfriend (F21) were just chilling at my house and my mom made a comment about how she could tell I had been home because we were running out of soap. She and my sister were talking loudly about it, and my girlfriend and I exchanged looks but neither of us said anything. I think she could tell I was a little bothered so she asked what was wrong, and I told her I was tired of hearing about how much soap I use, and that I couldn’t control it (washing my hands so much). She immediately said “I know, I know” and grabbed my arm, listening as I told her I couldn’t control it and how I don’t exactly remember when or how it started but it’d been that way for years, and I was about to thank her for never making me feel bad for it when she looked at me and said just that: “I will never make you feel bad for it babe, and I will always make sure you have all the soap in the world and never run out. Plus, I get a discount on it at my store, so it’s okay.” I wanted to cry hearing those words come out of her mouth before I even had the chance to say anything. This isn’t the first time she’s said something that’s validated my OCD; she’s made comments here and there before and is completely unbothered by it. I never thought I’d find someone who is so accepting of a mental disorder that isn’t always easy to understand. She’s never once made me feel bad for it and has always accepted me as I am. It’s not an easy battle fighting OCD like this every single day. There’s also many other factors to it that often feel debilitating and smothering. But to know that she doesn’t mind, that she can understand something she’s never had to experience before, that she loves me regardless and chooses not to make me feel bad for something I have no control over—it made me love her even more. I’m so thankful to have found this, I’m so thankful that she’s never made it a big deal. She even buys big containers of soap so it’ll last us longer. Anyways, just wanted to tell someone this. It made me feel so validated and loved in that moment—especially when she said that right as I was about to thank her for never making me feel bad about it. I’m a very lucky guy, and it was just one of those things that made me realize that. Edit: wow thank you guys so much for the love! I promise I will reply to every one of your comments!! Just wanted to leave this here so y’all know I’ve read every one of them and I appreciate your kind words, and I will respond to all of you when I can!! ❤️ Edit: sooooo last night my girlfriend found my post (she uses Reddit as well) and got SO excited and said, “oh my god!! This is about me!! Did you see all the comments babe?? People are so sweet 😭” so thank you all from both of us for the love and kind words! I also appreciate those of you that left suggestions for better lotion. I will definitely look into it seeing as winter is around the corner and I’m not prepared for how bad my hands are going to get. I’m sure I’ll find something at some point, and thanks to y’all I have plenty of options to choose from! I appreciate all the love and kind words. I wasn’t expecting this much love from this post, but I’m really glad I got it. Those of you telling me I’ve got a keeper—I definitely do. I plan on marrying this girl one day. She’s everything I’ve ever wanted and more (as cheesy as that sounds)"},
{"Title": "How a Serendipitous Encounter with a Beautiful Woman Left a Lasting Impression", "Author": "u/SamFendernot", "Content": "Hey Reddit, Tonight, something really unexpected happened while I was wandering around downtown Naples at about 9:30 pm. I just moved here and was feeling a bit nostalgic, so I decided to check out a few local restaurants to ask about job openings. I figured finding something to do at night a party from my day job would help me settle in. After a few stops, I found this place called Le Colonial, which is a cool mix of Vietnamese and French cuisine. It really caught my eye. Inside, I met someone who really stood out. The manager—a young blonde with the most striking blue eyes I’ve ever seen—initially threw me off because I thought she was the hostess! After a quick chat, I left, but I couldn't stop thinking about her. So, 15 to 20 minutes later, I walked back in, pretending I needed a business card, but honestly, I just wanted to see her again and ask her out. When I asked her out, she seemed pleasantly surprised and genuinely happy, even though she mentioned she had a boyfriend. Her warm smile didn’t stop me. I took the business card, smiled back, and hinted that I’d be back. Boyfriend or not, I felt a connection I couldn't ignore. Hopefully, she’s not getting married anytime soon! I forgot to ask her name and it wasn’t on the card since she wasn’t the general manager, but I’ll make sure to remember it next time. Those eyes are hard to forget! Has anyone else had a spontaneous encounter like this? Any tips for my next visit to Le Colonial? I’d like to build a genuine connection with this beautiful woman while also respecting boundaries. 😈 you never know... Q1: What are some subtle, respectful ways to show her I'm interested without overstepping? Q2: Has anyone successfully turned a friendly connection into something more? How did you do it? Q3: Any tips for balancing persistence with respect in situations like this?"},

And i just went for it. It was nothing more than a lingering peck really. But that's what was perfect about it. It was dark so the nerves were subsided a bit. And it was just us which was even better to me. It was just so innocent and sweet. And that's all I wanted for my first kiss. And he perfectly punctuated it by saying, I love you. (Not for the first time we've passed that a while ago) But it was the perfect moment. Just laying there on his shoulder, with his arm around me, having kissed him and being so close. We sat like that the whole way to my house. And his parents aren't the type to point out affection like so many seem to do. So it was casual. But it was everything. I just love him so damn much and I had to share this moment. if you want to share your first kiss stories in the comments I'm all for hearing them :)"},

{"Title": "My boyfriend keeps making me coffees that I can barely keep down but I will \"gladly\" keep drinking them", "Author": "u/thepieintheoven", "Content": "When I was younger my mom used to make what she would call \"children's coffee\", which was essentially heated soy milk (I'm lactose intolerant) mixed with a bit of instant coffee powder. One day while my bf and I were at my parents' house, I asked my mom to make me this \"children's coffee\" and my boyfriend asked me what that was and I explained the story behind it and how I used to drink it a lot when I was younger. That's where it all began. Ffw a few weeks, we're at his mom's house and for a change there's soy milk in the fridge there (leftover from a family holiday we went on) so he asks me if I want children's coffee. Surprised, I asked him if he wanted to make it for me and he said yes. So obviously I agreed, it's a cute gesture. And it was good. Better than my mom's, even. Which is what I told him too. I guess from that point on it became his go-to act of service, because every single day when we're together he asks me if I want children's coffee, sometimes more than once a day too. Every time I say yes, because I can tell it makes him happy to make the coffees. But here's the problem: his recipe tastes HORRIBLE with almond milk. At least the almond milk we have at my parents' house. My mom does not want soy milk in her house because of the estrogen, so this substitute is the only thing my bf could use for the coffee, but man it tastes bad. I'm talking \"the flavor gives me a nauseated feeling if I drink more than half of it\" kind of bad. Still, every time he prepares it for me in the morning, I force myself to drink it all. I've asked him to switch up the recipe a bit to accommodate for the different milk substitute, but it's like no matter what he does, each time it ends up tasting worse. But whenever he hands me that coffee mug with a proud smile on his face it's like he just handed me a cup of love, how could I not drink that? There are many ways to get out of this situation. I am not afraid of being honest. I could easily tell him it just doesn't taste good with almond milk and he will not get upset. But I don't want to. I don't want him to stop doing this. It's almost like the bad flavor makes it better/sweeter? Sometimes I even consider asking him myself if he wants to make me that coffee, knowing it will taste bad. I guess that's just how love works."},

I’m so in love with this guy that sometimes it doesn’t seem real. I’ve known his family since I was 16. His parents have always been so welcoming and kind to me since the first time his sister had me over to hang out after school. My friend has been so supportive of us and is thrilled that we’re together but I’ve never really gotten his parent’s thoughts on us being together. I’ve been to their house a few times since I’ve been dating him and they both still seemed just as nice as ever. Last night we attended his cousin’s wedding. It was the first big family function of theirs I attended as his girlfriend. When we first got to the reception hall their dad made a big deal out of us walking in holding hands. He’s one of those dads who’s always making corny jokes and is just the sweetest guy. He came up to us and jokingly asked me “You know you can do better than this guy, don’t you?” I told him I didn’t think I could. Later in the evening when my boyfriend went to get us drinks I was sitting with his parents. His mom said “So. You and Robbie, huh?” She always calls him Robbie and he hates it. I said “Yeah, I think he’s just the greatest.” Or something like that. She told me she thinks it’s adorable that we got together and that we make the cutest couple. His dad chimes in that we’re half a cute couple. Then he gets all serious and says that they both think I’m a wonderful young woman and there’s no one else they’d rather see their son dating! I actually felt like crying. I think the world of their family and it feels so good to hear them say something like this to me. Then his mom squeezed my hand and said “Robbie really couldn’t have done any better for himself.” Ok. Now I really thought I might cry.I thanked them both for always being so kind to me over the years and welcoming me into their family. I really do feel like I’m a part of their family now."},
{"Title": "What's the difference between loving someone and being IN love with them?", "Author": "u/SunfireElfAmaya", "Content": "I'm 19NB and have been trying to understand the difference. Like, I get loving someone—you appreciate who they are, you enjoy being around them, you feel loved and safe with them etc—but how does that differ from being in love with them ie loving them romantically not platonically? For example, your best friend vs your romantic partner, you love both of them but other than (presumably) also being sexually attracted to your partner and not to your friend (would also appreciate if anyone has advice on what that actually means, is it literally looking at someone and having a desire to have sex with them?), is there a difference in how you feel about them? I feel like there has to be since I know that there are plenty of asexual people or people who just otherwise aren't interested in sex who still fall in love and differentiate between romantic and platonic relationships, so clearly being \"in love\" with someone is different than just loving them. So what does being \"in love\" actually feel like?"},

I keep thinking about having sex with other girls all the time. I used to be a womanizer before being with her, and after two years I wanna go back to it.

I really love her and we get along but im not sexually satisfied, im just used to having sex with a lot of girls and not just one, I never cheated on her and never will.

I don't wanna make her unhappy and her to cry but at this point I am in the relationship because of her well being and not because of mine, I can't stop thinking about finishing the relationship not even for one day for the last 4 months. I don't know what to do. If I tell her that I wanna finish and tell her to get another apartment she would not leave. She can't afford this apartment that we are living now, I can afford it even being alone. She can't, so she would need to move to a cheaper place by herself, but she wont want to finish and when she starts crying im gonna feel bad and get back with her... it happened once before, I tried leaving her but I just felt so guilty seeing her crying so I stayed. I just wanna experience what is to be single again. Maybe Im just not made for relationships... what should I do? help )': TLDR: I want but I emotionally can't leave my girlfriend even though im not happy. Live together, lease finishes in 1 year, I was thinking on waiting until then to part ways separate but im just no happy, I wanna experience to be single again."},

I thought I’d get on my phone or something to pass the time. He wrapped his arm around me, still totally asleep, and snuggled me. I felt so warm and safe and contented. I fell asleep within minutes. I know this doesn’t sound like anything significant, but I have a lot of trouble napping because I’m usually too consumed by anxious feelings about work I need to get done. The fact that I was able to fall asleep so quickly in the middle of the day with him makes me so happy. Hearing his slow breathing and being all wrapped up is so comforting. There’s really nothing like it. I feel so lucky. These impromptu naps have happened only a few times, and I look back on every one of them so fondly. It’s such a rare moment of letting go & relaxing for me and I love that I can have those moments with someone I love so much. So, yeah. Love is naps.

We hadn’t been together for very long, just a couple months, but we both knew it was very different from anything else we had experienced. We had unashamed conversations of marriage, children, homes, issues, exes, strengths, weaknesses and just what life would be like together. It felt so right, but not in a rose colored glasses way, in a very raw and vulnerable way. One night we were at my house and we were drinking a little bit of wine, we went out to look at the stars and have a little smoke. We were in the middle of a silly conversation and he did a totally random 180 to ask me about what kind of tree growth my woods were (he works in forestry!). I laughed so hard and let the I love you I had been holding on the tip of my tongue for weeks slip. He just laughed along with me and the night continued without mention of what I said. The next day rolls around and this part of the story gets a little confusing but I’ll give the short version. Basically I had a friend who was friends with my partners ex girlfriend. That friend (m) liked to tell me(f) all the negative details of my partners past relationship. I hear another story from this friend and shoot my partner a text. (just to clarify we had been openly communicating about his previous relationship from day one prior to my friends input, as well as all of my previous relationships). I tell him that i heard more from my friend and would like to talk. He comes right over even though i was just expecting a phone call. After we talked everything through we go outside again to let the dogs out. He starts apologizing for putting me through all of this drama because he knows it’s not really enjoyable for anyone involved. We talk a bit more and I just tell him that it’s okay, and I trust him, and that our relationship is what we make it and these things don’t have to influence us negatively, they can build us up. He says “I think I love you.”, and I tell him that “I know I love you.”…. A day or two later we’re talking about it and HE NEVER HEARD MY I LOVE YOU FROM THE PREVIOUS NIGHT!!! He thought he was saying it first and I thought I had said it first. I just find that to be the cutest thing. Neither of us were afraid of taking that first step. Everything was perfectly balanced and it makes me feel incredibly happy to think about. He is my person. Thank you for reading♥️"},

{"Title": "To The Person Who Overthinks In Their Relationship", "Author": "u/butteryflakeycrust-", "Content": "It’s not your fault. You never chose to be this way. You didn't choose to be an over thinker. You wish you didn't have to re-read or take a second to think about what they said. Their words never seem to come out as hurtful but to you, the over thinker ; they are and they always will be. You try your best not to over analyze the things they say but it never works. You take what is said and make the worst of it. When something of minor inconvenience takes hold, it isn't just minor anymore. It engulfs your entire mind to the point where you are overthinking everything. Every Last Thing . You start to question everything about the relationship. You let your emotions take over and conquer you. You’re worried, aren't you? You’re worried that one day your overthinking will be too much and they will leave just like everyone else, right? You don’t mean to be clingy . You don't want to become a burden that you think you’re becoming to them. So what do you do? You overthink . You doubt their love for you is as strong as yours. How could they love you the same? As an over thinker you question everything. You’re worried about them wanting to be with someone else like when they take too long to respond. “ They must have found someone else” . As a result; you respond right away because you've been waiting for their response for hours.. You assume that they were talking to someone better. Your mind takes you into a state of emergency of overthinking. Telling you only the wrong things you don't need to hear. When they’re too busy to see you, it auto corrects in your mind as “they do not want to see me”. Any simple texts can turn into a roller coaster full of over thinking emotions. Now from everything i've addressed.. Forget about it and take a minute to process what i’m about to say. Don’t go back and re-read what they said.. You have nothing to worry about. Do not doubt their love for you, that hurts their feelings. They just have different ways of showing love than you do.You are not a burden to them, they just have a busy life on top of your relationship. They do love you as much as you do. They haven't responded in a while? Be patient, they want to talk to you they are just busy. When they are too busy to see you, don't take it personally; understand that they will make time when they can. They are trying. So try to understand from their point of view as well. So please do not overthink about your relationship, it isn't healthy for you or your partner. How do I know this? Because I have felt the same things.. I have been anxious about not getting a text back in a certain amount of time. I have thought they didn’t love me anymore because of little things they say. But with that being said, I'm learning (have learned) to not let it control me as much as it used to… Just remember Everything will be okay, just breathe. Sincerely, A person who overthinks in their relationship"},

She even decided to name me her best man (or man of honor) whenever she gets married.  That's honestly one of the greatest honors to be given and I appreciate it a great deal.  I still love her to this day, at least as a person (not romantically, but platonically).  I learned she was my platonic soulmate since December 2023, though did take me time to confirm it and share with her. I have made many friends online, but this one in particular is unlike any other I have made.  The fact I learned she is my platonic soulmate makes it more special.  Even though I know how to find my own happiness; it's great to have someone be a special addition like her.  It's incredible to know someone who thinks on a very similar wavelength, able to connect very quickly, very similar values, etc.  Again, I appreciate her a great deal. 🥰 If you have one or more platonic soulmates you truly appreciate, feel free to share. 😉"},

I don’t think i could live life without him anymore; if something were to happen i’d hope we could remain friends.:)🫶"},

I was using crack and heroin and fentanyl and I decided \"yo that's enough this has gone way to far I need to stop\". So after rehab and Suboxone maintenance here I am, 70 something days sober. But before I got clean I met this girl and me and her hit it off pretty well. I decided that I'd stop the random sex with strangers with my drug habit since honestly that usually went hand and hand. Now I want to say I've done my fair share of drugs and I will always have a special place in my heart for psychedelics. That's the one thing I'll probably always do, and maybe ecstasy on very special occasions. I also am a huge fan and supporter of DMT. With that said me and girl spend a lot of time together and she's actually the first person I fell in love with. Like from the moment we first hung out we hit it off like no one I've ever met. It feels like I've always known her. And my favorite thing to do with her is hug... I know it sounds dumb but like for real, I love sex, I love kissing her, I love making her feel special, but like I REAAAALY love just hugging her. She gives the best hugs and they make me feel AMAZING. Last night we hugged for a solid 30 or 40 minutes. Just on the beach under the cloudy moon lit sky. Dancing and stumbling all over the cool sand but never breaking our embrace. Hardcore hugging, like full on face buried in shoulder standing in the rain hugging. She holds me like she never wants to let go. And tbh I don't ever want her to! Keep in mind that I'm sober, but I felt kinda like I'm rolling, but not as intense but still like it was crazy. I actually feel high when I'm hugging her. Before I met her I was sure that nothing could make me feel as good as heroin, but then she came along. Things are going so well we're just in total bliss. I never let anyone in like this, I've never felt like this, Ill love this girl till death."},
{"Title": "Don’t believe the myth you’ll only experience true love once", "Author": "u/obviousthrowawyy", "Content": "When I ended my engagement in my early 20s, my ex told me that’d one day I’d regret it. During the next two failed relationships, he was somewhat correct; I felt I had fumbled the one man I had an authentic, non-forced romantic relationship with to try and force relationships with men who weren’t truly in love with me or compatible. During the most recent failed relationship, I told myself that at 30, I had to settle for a less-than-ideal relationship, because I had already experienced one relationship with a man who was head over heels for me. In my early 30s, I’m in a relationship where I feel secure and where my partner regularly approves he genuinely adores me. Nothing was forced, everything progressed naturally. I’m a more mature and emotionally independent person than I was when I was engaged; that relationship was doomed to fail because of my own immaturity, toxicity and codependence, but that doesn’t mean what I experienced then wasn’t true love, nor does it detract from the love I’m experiencing now.

Our communication has been so good and it’s easy to just say what is on my mind without worrying about how he will react. And the cherry on top of it all is the fact that I prefer to sleep with my hair braided, but I can’t braid. So every night he comes in the bathroom while I’m brushing my teeth and braids it for me.

Sure we have days where we argue but we always resolve and speak fairly to one another. I’ve never loved someone like I love her. Sometimes it’s like I’m looking into a mirror we are so alike but we are also so different I can’t explain it. Most days consist of me getting off work and going to either her place or mine where she will be waiting for me. Then we go to the gym and either cook or get food. After that it’s yk what time then we shower and watch tv together. It’s so simple and mundane but so meaningful. I can talk to her about anything and she just gets me and vice versa. She is the most beautiful amazing woman I’ve ever met and I’m so excited for our future. We will be moving in together near the end of the summer and I haven’t been this excited for anything in so long. She’s already started picking out decorations and furniture; it’s so adorable. She tells me she loves me at least 50 times a day. We’re both young and started supporting ourselves younger than most so it’s so nice to be with someone who understands the challenges that comes with. I would do anything for this girl.

{"Title": "My boyfriend made me cry happy tears for the first time in my life.", "Author": "u/xduckymoox", "Content": "This happened while we were on the phone late at night, somewhere in the AM. I love listening to him, and he enjoys telling stories, so I laid there with my blanket wrapped around me, listening to him tell me different sweet and happy stories. I felt so comfortable and safe in that moment, like nothing could go wrong. It was such a warm, nice feeling. I told him this, saying how safe, comfortable, and happy I felt. In response, he started saying such kind things. He told me things like: \"You're safe now.\" \"I won't let anything hurt you.\" and \"You can rest now.\" I've never been told anything like this before. My whole life, I've been used to abuse and hurt. To hear such simple yet kind sentences as these... shook me to my core. I started crying. Words like that were so foreign. They didn't feel like words I was meant to hear, yet he was telling me them. He began comforting me as I wept softly, but I was mainly holding back. I've never been good at crying in front of anyone. I made a small, joking comment through the tears like, \"I wonder how much I'd cry if I didn't hold back.\" In response, he told me not to hold back, and to just let myself cry and feel the emotions. And so I did. Crying has always been a painful thing for me. When I cry, there's a genuine pain deep in my stomach and it makes me cry out both from the sheer mental pain and from the physical pain. It's like the deep hurt I have bottled up takes physical form. Yet this crying was... gentle. There was no pain, no crying out. Just... happiness. I've never cried happy tears for anything, but in that moment, with the tears streaming down my face and clouding my eyes, that's all I felt. As I listened to his soothing voice tell me everything was going to be okay and that he wouldn't let anything hurt me, I was genuinely happy. For almost 2 hours afterward, I sobbed as he told me these kind words. I think a part of me healed that night. The part that didn't think it would ever be possible for me to be treated with this kind of kindness and love. The part of me who didn't think I deserved any. And all I felt was relief. Relief both at so much built up pain being alleviated that night, and at the fact that I have someone who loves me enough to help me deal with this pain. It was that night that I realized just how much I really loved him. There's nobody else I'd rather spend the rest of my life with, and I know he's the amazing man I'll marry some day."},

My brother got married this past weekend,  and I'm so happy for him . Little did I know a wedding would break me down , and it did Monday night. Sunday I was exhausted after getting home after it , swollen feet , and sleep deprived . Monday became a Monday for no reason, and it hit like a tidal wave .  I cleaned my car out and vacuumed it out . My dad was being annoying bc he just had to see how good of a job I did on my own car . He wanted to \" Inspect \" it . I said no your not seeing the inside of my car , I bought it and pay for it . He returned with being petty and on my case about stuff . I asked him where I could get my state inspection done , he wasn't a help . Every Monday is trash day .... he is an odd ball about it . I did the dishes after dinner and I apparently had to take the trash out asap .  I was over his attitude mostly. It hit me the wrong way , and then my bf ... I wanted to see him . I offered to get dinner and drinks and I didn't get a response till later on . It was too late to go out with him bc my dad was also making dinner at the time . I was just over the whole day , and I was still exhausted.  I got to see my bf today for lunch on his break , and it was nice . Last night I just bawled.  I bawled like a baby , bc I was over the wedding stuff , my ex husband didn't want to do a huge thing for us getting married, and I guess again grieving in a way . Grieving bc I didn't have a big wedding, grieving bc of a lot back then.  I'm not sure if it was any sort of a trigger , but damn it.  My bf called me tonight like usual , and he is making me dinner , washed the bed sheets and wants to go to the beach for sunset tomorrow . I mentioned that I see him once a week , and it kills me . He offered to spend time with me this weekend as well,  and tomorrow night.  Sometimes , I forget that I have someone who actually cares and loves me . I felt a disconnect from him, but I over think . My gut feelings weren't screaming,  just my heart was aching . I really was sad and mad at the world . I tried to call my bestie , bc she usually helps me figure shit out . I think I understand why I was upset and what I needed.  Long story short , I feel better and get to be spoiled tomorrow night . Oh and the hot water heater blew... so a cold shower is a must tomorrow yay ."},

You are the joyful exclamation, ‘the best day ever!’ In you I see patterns perfectly aligned. I see colours a shade brighter. In you I see raindrops turn to falling diamonds. I see natures finest beauty. A heart of the most precious gold. A soul in his purest form. In fact I know that you’re one of a kind. In you I see life, I see everything that makes life worth living. In you, I see my life. I see me spending it with you. I see a locket of your heart with my photo placed in its delicate frame. In you I see my last breath. I see forever in you. - u/scrapiee"},

It was all so new to me even at my age.  I know you've had limited relationship experience too and that your last one ended tragically. We'd been getting really close, really fast and the intensity of our physical relationship has been a whirlwind. Three weeks ago, that changed when we spent the night together for the first time.  You were super sweet for the next two days and then you became cold and shut me out.  You told mutual friends of ours that you needed time.  This was obviously becoming more than a FWB thing and you freaked. You promised me you wouldn't run for the hills. Since then, you keep reaching out to me but not making plans with me to talk about any of this, or called me. I keep trying to be patient. We have such amazing chemistry, it's easy being with you.  I have given more of myself to you than I have to anybody else in my entire life. You could have just told me you needed a breather, I would have been fine. I just want you. I want to get close to you. You said I was beautiful, that you wanted me, that you loved being with me.  You call me sweetie and hold my hand, you took a day off work to spend time with me. And now we're nowhere. Do you even miss me? What are you so scared of? Somebody loving you? I am trying, but I can't put myself through this for much longer. All I've been asking for is for us to sit down and talk about this to see if we can move forward and I can't even get that. You are breaking my heart."},

Either way I can't catch my breath. And I feel so stupid because you probably forgot what day is today. You probably already forgot what we were. To you, mine was just a role, right? No matter who takes it. I finally had a stable and well paid job. I was gonna get us a new home. Everything seemed perfect at first. But I guess the taller, toxic guy with a random job who lived close to you was even better. How can I start loving somebody else as easily as you did? You have fun with him while I keep dreaming of you at night. In my dreams I can see you, talk with you, hug you, lay on a bed with you. Everything feels better. Then I wake up, and everything feels worse than before. I begin asking myself, why should I even get up from bed and work? Yeah, for myself. To keep my life going. But who's giving me back the one half you took away from me? It's as if I never existed in the first place, and I hate you for what you've done to me. Still. You will always be family to me.

He travels for work, usually a week or so at a time but this trip is only a day or two and I’m at his house. He woke me this morning and as he was leaving he said “I love you” my half asleep brain didn’t process it immediately so I said “be safe” Now I’m questioning if it was a slip or if he meant it. I won’t have this conversation through the phone so I’m waiting till probably tomorrow night for him to get home. I feel like a teenager lol I do love him but I never said it regularly after the first time because I don’t want to put pressure on him. For a little context we both had really damaging long relationships before meeting. My husband was abusive and passed away and his ex seems to have been verbally and mentally abusive toward him.

Every other relationship I have been in as been abusive. I’ve been with narcissists, people who’ve emotionally, physically and sexually abusive to me. For the last few months I’ve been dating a lovely man. Not a drug addict, looks like a model, he’s sooo kind and respectful of women, owns his own business, never shouts or takes his anger out on me. Shows me love and affection. I met him through one of my friends of 16 years who has vetted him and told him he’s good for me and tried to set us up. He accepts me whole heartedly and is supportive. My mum passed away and he supported me all the way through it and came to the funeral, he’s generous with me and showers me with adoration and wants to spend as much time with me as possible. One of my close friends told my other friend, I’m looking forward to meeting him because he seems good for her. This other friend also knew of him, he said “he had a healthy relationship with with his ex, but (my name) has only been in toxic relationships” it made me feel that most people think I’m at fault for being abused in relationships. I feel relieved that I’ll be in a healthy relationship and won’t be victim blamed or villainised for the abuse I’ve endured, this will be the relationship that maybe will wake people up that I’m not the problem other than condoning it for too long.

We've now been together for a year and a half and I definitely can say I found my person. We not only have similar interests but we get along so well and really understand each other. He does everything he can to make sure I'm happy in the relationship and occasionally asks if there's any issues or concerns I have. He does little things for me like take out the trash, surprise me with little things like Starbucks, or offers to get me food delivered if I'm not feeling well. He also took me to his home country and I got to meet his family and I just felt so welcomed and it was so nice to see where he grew up. I never thought l'd love someone so much that I'm willing to spend a little time everyday learning a new language.

He was so affectionate and calling me perfect and “more beautiful in person” and be was so patient about everything including our first kiss, which made me like him 1000x more. I think we touched foreheads about 5 times trying to go for the first kiss but I kept backing out LOL. After the first one, the rest were so easy. He was complimenting me all night and hugging me every second and kissing all over my forehead and cheek and neck but I loved that I could tell it was endearing and not sexual. Like I literally FELT the affection radiating off of him. On the dance floor we were hugging and I was leaning back on him and he just stayed there for me even tho he HATES dancing and swore off of it. He spent 60% of the night there for me, which I’m very grateful for. His smile was so genuine and he would look at me and ask for a kiss over and over it was so cute dude. Everything physical he took his time w, which btw didnt go far but like what we did do he was so gentle with and asked “can I……..” “yes or no?” I found it so adorable in the moment. ik it’s bare minimum but it’s just a relief and honestly blessing knowing he cares how I feel in the moment and thinks about me when he’s horny ig? 😭 Like seriously, even our tongue kiss was so gentle. I was so nervous and he was like “for one second, I’ll teach you,” and not in a demanding way but more question and care. I did it and then did it 1-2 more times for a couple seconds and got embarrassed and dug my head into his chest bc I thought I was doing really bad, and then I just like mumbled “I don’t know what to do or how to do it..” and he reassured me the second after and was saying “nooooo it was good….baby it was perfect, I swear.” and I was blushing the WHOLE TIME. Anyways, after the bus ride back and cute I just kinda laid on his shoulder and almost passed out on his lap bc I was so exhausted and we took a drive to Dave and busters but he had to leave early, sadly. I think one of the cutest things was him saying “the pictures please, the PhotoBooth and card” bc I had taken a picture for us and made us save each others table cards and him remembering and saying it in the actual most adorable voice, not like a baby but like imagine a grown man or deep voiced guy just saying it so softly. Then he said I love you and I’ll miss you and we kissed goodbye 🙁. Now, I’m going to his house in a week or two for his pool and we’re gonna have fun in there there watch a movie together and cuddle in our matching pjs and build a lego set I bought us. I’m so happy so have stuck through the long year of petty fights and lack of touch bc it was all worth it. Our 15 months is in 6 days, it feels surreal. I’m gonna marry this man, mark my words."},

{"Title": "My Fiancé Stole $40 From Me… But It’s Not What You Think.", "Author": "u/New_Sea344", "Content": "It’s not what you think. This happened early on in our relationship, a little under four years ago. When we met my guy was starting his recovery from a serious meth addiction and as you can imagine I didn’t want to be involved with that, at all. So even though we had a serious connection I kept turning him down because I didn’t want to take any chances there, but after about six months of getting to know him I finally broke down and kissed him. We got together, and things were great. Then about six more months into our relationship there was one bad day where he wasn’t acting like himself and he was out hanging out with some guys I didn’t know, and I ended up finding $40 missing from my bank account. When I confronted him about it he admitted what he’d done. And I took my time to think about what that meant to me, because obviously I couldn’t just ignore what had happened. I definitely wasn’t going to just sit there and let him do things like that, to me or to himself. I wasn’t going to be an enabler and I wasn’t going to tie myself to that. So I took him and sat him down. And I explained that I knew he was recovering from a serious addiction and because of that I was going to forgive him for what had happened. And I also explained that I would give him two years. I wouldn’t commit to anything serious in that time, but if he could stay completely clean and sober it would show me that he was serious about our relationship. And to show him I was just as serious, I said that if he could do that, I would marry him. Now, four years later, he’s still completely sober and we’re engaged and I can say without a doubt that giving him a second chance that night was absolutely the best decision I have ever made. He is the love of my life. He never hesitates to tell me how beautiful I am or how much he loves me, and when I’m feeling bad he always does everything he possibly can to make me feel better. He is my world."},

As soon as it started playing, he stood up, came to my computer, put his arms around me and said, \"Come on, let's go snuggle.\" I was already crying.

But then on the other those very same individuals get too scared/timid to actually let others in on real emotionally intimate level. How can someone be loved unconditionally if they don't show who they truly are to others? When I say this I mean, their fears, insecurities, and doubts in the moment as well as the positives. So many go out their way to protect their own ego that they hurt those willing to want to love them for who they are. I do think a lot is because of issues with perfectionism and what it means to be attractive. It's scary to actually put yourself truly on the line like that. But by doing so makes you a fantasticaslly strong individual. To accept and understand that you are a perfectly imperfect individual takes a lot of strength, and through that strength is being vulnerable you can have a chance at unconditional love.

I look at the casual photos I love taking of her and I think she’s so sexy, so inspiring, so beautiful, and so intelligent. She’s off the radar bro. She’s crazy to think she’s ugly if she really believes that. I seriously love this women. I love to see her laugh. I love when it’s me making her laugh. I love the way she walks. I even love when she’s nagging, I don’t mean it in any disrespectful way. For example, when she tries to convince me to take cab home instead of walking home at night and she’s super serious but I still decide to walk home, because overall I live like 15 blocks away lol.

I super love her hugs and when it lasts for more than 10 seconds. I love her style. I love her charisma. I love how funny she is. I love her principles. I love her dog. I literally can go on and on.

I Need to use my brain and show her it’s more than the dates, the past sex, etc. I really can’t explain it but I just love the time she gives me, the care she had for me, everything yo.

{"Title": "For 30 Years, I loved with contempt. My ex wife despised me.", "Author": "u/saffermaster", "Content": "After a few years licking my wounds, I put myself out there at age 55, trying to find love. I spent 4 years enjoying kinky sex with women of every age. From 18 to 60. Nothing I did could fill the emptiness I felt in my broken heart. One woman I dated shared with me that in spite of my sense of failure, that she found me imminently lovable. Another lover told me that I am too distant and \"You need to let me in,\" I went out and got a tattoo on my chest that took 7 months to complete. It captured my sense that attraction was possible, that there was a certain randomity to the world, that we lived in an endless universe and that I am lovable. Its a cool trash punk tattoo. I looked hard at what was missing from my marriage. It occurred to me that intimacy was missing. One day I got a message from a woman on a kink site who saw my \"seeking post\". She was as kinky as me and also looking for intimacy and we started a dialogue. We courted for 6 months before we began our dynamic formally. That was 6 years ago. in 6 days I am going to marry her. I could not be happier. We not only found love, we fell in love and have had a steamy love affair that goes on and on. I am so here for it. Its possible to find love. I can guarantee that there is love after divorce. My life is poetry. Update: Kink is interesting. People of all ages participate. There are kids who learn about kink at a very young age, and are perhaps more ready to explore kink when they get to age 18 than others are till much later in life. One thing about being Dom in a kink setting like a club or munch is that submissives of all ages and genders approach you and negotiate a scene with you. Remember, all kink is based on consent, not persuasion, informed enthusiastic consent. I should have noted that I practice RACK which is Risk-Aware Consensual Kink, and SSC, Safe, Sane Consensual Kink. I get the idea that morality has it that young adults should not play with old adults, but that is simply your own ick, nobody else's. We have a saying in kink, \"I'm not going to yuck on your yum\""},

We made our relationship official in April, so I like to think we took it pretty slow. In every other relationship I have ever had, I felt the need to be so careful about my body, my choices, and never felt at home with my partners. I always was waiting for the next step of where I was going to go to next. I made sure that we used multiple forms of protection when we were intimate. I never felt like I could be my sensitive, extroverted self fully. Before we became romantic, he helped me pass the final course I needed for my first degree. I had been calling my \"Rave Husband\", because we were always attached at the hip at the many raves we stuffed into a year. He spent the day with me after I had emergency surgery, just so I wouldn't be alone. He is one of the only people that has ever made an effort to celebrate my birthday. He got out of his car when I did, because he thought he was going to have to pull me off of some guy in front of a bar, and still decided to want me. He watched me projectile vomit outside of a show in 100 degree weather, and left early with me, and cuddled me while I looked like a drowned sewer rat months long before he declared his feelings. With this man??? I told this man today that I trust him enough to decide when and if he ever wants to put a baby in me. I told this man that I would provide for him whatever he desires in this world and then more. I made this man know I intend on marrying him and making sure that he smiles every day for the rest of his life. I let this man do things to me today that I would have never allowed anyone else do. Suddenly, just like magic, I would give him everything I am and still be searching for more to give him. Every day, I find out more about him that makes my love grow even bigger. I sat in my bedroom for hours today waiting for him to call on his work break, in shock with myself at the words that had come out of my mouth to him before he had left. Never in my life have I been down this bad for someone. Every day it gets worse. I grieve for the time in this life that I won't get to spend with him. I have never wanted to just spend a day laying around with someone. It's like I have been possessed. Somehow, I have known my best friend for over a year now and the love I have for him only continues to grow exponentially with time that I fear I may one day explode. SOS"},

It kills me every eye waking moment. I can’t stop thinking about how you may be slowly falling out of love for me and how our connection is less than what we had before. It makes me second guess everything and our relationship. Questions like Did you ever love me? Ofc you did. You stood by me when things were stressful. Your actions are louder than words, yet I think maybe you did not love me much as you thought. It’s fine, I just hate to think I’m not your person and you aren’t mine.  Why aren’t we trying to reconcile this? I mean we’re friends still so is that what that is? You said you were firm in your decision in not getting back with me. I try not to let it bother me; not cling to our little memories we had and not push away the fact you may over and done with me. I’m trying to experience the gift of life without fighting it. Yet my will is strong in not letting you go. New beginnings? Why do I feel that you’re going to eventually leave me once you find discover a new connection? It’s ideal. Is our friendship ideal?. Wishes of my life in order so that we can shine in gold and sparkle in the night time. We take it all off and we still shine. I’m sorry I ever pursued you and I wasn’t ready yet I don’t feel bad, how could I be? You allowed me to feel a feeling I never felt before. I  wish you can run to me when your heart feels heavy and lean your head on my shoulder. We had sex once after the break up and I wish you wanted my love more than you lust for sex at the moment? Is that a valid statement to say? Maybe you do want my love but baby I want all of you not just part of you. Please come home and sit still inside me because I would hate to see you come and go. Until you find someone new… I’ll be here… until you find someone new Ill be here. I just wanted to make you know how I feel although it may bug you I’m overthinking. I just wish things were different. I know you may feel different. I love you for it regardless. I love to see you prosper with or without me. It hurts but baby I’m here in the back of the ceremony rooting for you, so happy for you, I know your eyes are fixed on someone new and other things so you don’t notice me and that’s fine, here I am, happy for your accomplishments. I will forever love you as long as I know who I am and the love I have experienced. I will always pray for you and your family as I have been doing. Thank you for reading this.

{"Title": "A little story of how I met the girl I’ve been talking to.", "Author": "u/Zealousideal_Ad321", "Content": "Sorry, this will be long, but very worth the read. The feeling of new love is so euphoric, I just have to share. We have decided not to put a label on what we have going on, so I don’t consider her my girlfriend by any means. I broke up with an ex of 1 year about a month and a half ago, and since about 4 weeks ago, me and this girl have been talking more than before, and hanging out. I never even thought about flirting or making a move, because I was in the process of getting out of a relationship I felt stuck in. More than anyone else, she helped me understand what was wrong with my relationship and would always give pointers on how to make relationships more successful. I had given up on love. For months before I broke up with my ex, me and this girl talked all the time about love. I explained to her many many times that I’ve lost faith in relationships. My ex of 5 years cheated on me along with physical abuse. My ex after that started acting like my other ex(very violent) and I decided that no one should ever feel threatened by their partner, even if they haven’t taken a swing yet. This girl explained to me that life is about taking chances and dating shouldn’t be ruled out just yet. Always kind of hinting at the thought of us being together. I work as a CNA in a long term care facility and she does the same PRN. We don’t work together much, but everytime we have, it seems like every one of our coworkers seem to think we were together. It’s not just our coworkers, the residents we take care of hint at it and tease us both about dating each other. A week or so after I broke up with my ex, I was on the phone with her. We talked about what went wrong and why I had bad luck with dating before. She kept expressing to not lose hope. The next day we worked together and while we were changing residents/doing vitals etc, she kept sort of bumping into me. She would stand really close when we talked and never took her eye off me. I knew what was happening and I wasn’t about to let my insecurities pass this off. We started talking about taking it super slow in a relationship being the best choice. She mentions she wouldn’t mind doing something like that and I say the same. To hang out, talk all the time, whatever couples do, just not labeling it. We figure that’s the best way to do things, except that we’ve already knew each other for 11 months that I’ve been working with her and have became very good friends. When she brings this up I knew for a fact that she wanted to go out with me, so I asked her if she wanted to come have some drinks and watch some movies at my house. She very quickly agreed and we made a date to hang out. When the time comes, she shows up at my house, like an hour late(she had a good excuse) and we start talking. We put on a movie but not a second of it was watched. We just talked and talked. I knew I couldn’t chicken out and not make a move, and I also knew that with her being very shy, there was no way she was going to make a move. Everytime I got up from the couch to grab another beer or make her a drink, I would sit closer and closer when I got back to the couch. At this point I’ve had 2 or 3 beers and I was starting to feel my intuition slip away. Even if she tells me she doesn’t like me like that, I’ll be able to defend my actions and apologize, so what’s to lose? I had this overwhelming feeling that I misunderstood all of our talks and all the hints, all the things residents and coworkers have said. I felt like she wasn’t comfortable and that I was going to make a big mistake if I were to make a move.  After making her a drink and sitting down right next to her, were our arms are touching, I throw my arm around her and she sinks into me, holding me, like she’s been waiting 11 months for this. I’ve never felt so exhilarated in my life. I figured I’ve got it in the bag, so I lean in to kiss her and she grabs my face and pulls it closer. We ended up making out for quite some time before she had to leave for work in the morning. I felt very very happy about this and high on life. Within a couple days we had already set up another time for us to hang out. I decided we should go on a hike, then back to my house. That was very successful as well and I felt like there was nothing stopping us from continuing this. She’s been on vacation for the last 2 weeks but we plan to go camping next Wednesday and Thursday on an island. We have so much in common and she is absolutely stunning. I can’t mess this up, but I at least know for sure that even if it doesn’t work out, we will still be great friends. Thank you for all that came to listen , have a great day!"},

I know we've both moved on with our lives, but that doesn't diminish the significance of the impact you had on me. I just wanted you to know that I'm grateful for the time we had together even though short lived and the person you helped me become.

He makes me so happy.", "Author": "u/sheerest_of_folly", "Content": "I know not many people will likely care to read my rant, but I love this man so fucking much. We’ve been dating for almost 3 years (anniversary in July). For 2.5 of them, we were online. Online relationships are hard. He’s in South Carolina, I was in Maryland. I decided to move to him. On the way down, on January 31st, literally 40 minutes away, my mom fell asleep at the wheel and we crashed into the moving van (she was going to drop me off, as she herself was moving to Florida with my youngest sibling. Other sibling stayed with Dad in Maryland for college.) I was the only one moderately injured in the wreck (thank God) and was taken to the hospital in an ambulance. I told my boyfriend where. He met me there. I saw my boyfriend in person for the first time while on a hospital bed. The first few months were rough for me to settle in. 21 years in Maryland in the same area my whole life was hard to transition from. My boyfriend was with me every step of the way. March was the anniversary of the deaths of several people who were important to me in my youth. They died in a car crash when I was a young teen. In Maryland, every year I would go to the playground we all played at on their deathiversary, since none of them were buried (all cremated to my knowledge). My boyfriend drove me the 500 miles to go back to Maryland to be at that playground. In April, I had a breast reduction surgery. The recovery for that was rough— for the first two weeks, I couldn’t reach my middle well enough to use the bathroom. This man wiped my pee for me, and once the anesthesia wore off, my poop too. I got my period in the second week. He learned how to put a tampon in me and take it out. He was by my side the whole time. The breast reduction was done in Maryland and we stayed with my father for a week. I’ve only seen my father cry three times: when our cat died, at the end of Star Wars (because “it’s so happy, they got the medals they worked so hard for” 💀), and when my boyfriend and I left. My father said he’s a good man and he’s so happy for us. He also gave him $400 to “pay him back” for medical expenses. My boyfriend ended up using the remainder on a date with me. Speaking of dates. I love notebooks and pens; my boyfriend doesn’t really care about those. Yet he took me on a date to Staples and Michaels, I thought to window shop but he bought so much for me. He also gets me some model skulls that I collect when he sees a cool one. Shortly after I moved in, he came home with one meant for an aquarium: “I thought of you.” I cried. We went to MomoCon this year, and he cosplayed with me. We went as Leon and Ada from the Resident Evil series (specifically the RE4 remake). He waited in line for Digimon and Pokémon voice actors with me and listened to me rant about the characters I like. We’re getting married next year. We aren’t conventionally engaged yet— he has something planned but won’t tell me— but we know we’re getting married. We just haven’t told our families yet. I’m so fucking excited and happy that this is the man I get to spend my life with."},

He was so affectionate and calling me perfect and “more beautiful in person” and be was so patient about everything including our first kiss, which made me like him 1000x more. I think we touched foreheads about 5 times trying to go for the first kiss but I kept backing out LOL. After the first one, the rest were so easy. He was complimenting me all night and hugging me every second and kissing all over my forehead and cheek and neck but I loved that I could tell it was endearing and not sexual. Like I literally FELT the affection radiating off of him. On the dance floor we were hugging and I was leaning back on him and he just stayed there for me even tho he HATES dancing and swore off of it. He spent 60% of the night there for me, which I’m very grateful for. His smile was so genuine and he would look at me and ask for a kiss over and over it was so cute dude. Everything physical he took his time w, which btw didnt go far but like what we did do he was so gentle with and asked “can I……..” “yes or no?” I found it so adorable in the moment. ik it’s bare minimum but it’s just a relief and honestly blessing knowing he cares how I feel in the moment and thinks about me when he’s horny ig? 😭 Like seriously, even our tongue kiss was so gentle. I was so nervous and he was like “for one second, I’ll teach you,” and not in a demanding way but more question and care. I did it and then did it 1-2 more times for a couple seconds and got embarrassed and dug my head into his chest bc I thought I was doing really bad, and then I just like mumbled “I don’t know what to do or how to do it..” and he reassured me the second after and was saying “nooooo it was good….baby it was perfect, I swear.” and I was blushing the WHOLE TIME. Anyways, after the bus ride back and cute I just kinda laid on his shoulder and almost passed out on his lap bc I was so exhausted and we took a drive to Dave and busters but he had to leave early, sadly. I think one of the cutest things was him saying “the pictures please, the PhotoBooth and card” bc I had taken a picture for us and made us save each others table cards and him remembering and saying it in the actual most adorable voice, not like a baby but like imagine a grown man or deep voiced guy just saying it so softly. Then he said I love you and I’ll miss you and we kissed goodbye 🙁. Now, I’m going to his house in a week or two for his pool and we’re gonna have fun in there there watch a movie together and cuddle in our matching pjs and build a lego set I bought us. I’m so happy so have stuck through the long year of petty fights and lack of touch bc it was all worth it. Our 15 months is in 6 days, it feels surreal. I’m gonna marry this man, mark my words."},

This happened early on in our relationship, a little under four years ago. When we met my guy was starting his recovery from a serious meth addiction and as you can imagine I didn’t want to be involved with that, at all. So even though we had a serious connection I kept turning him down because I didn’t want to take any chances there, but after about six months of getting to know him I finally broke down and kissed him. We got together, and things were great. Then about six more months into our relationship there was one bad day where he wasn’t acting like himself and he was out hanging out with some guys I didn’t know, and I ended up finding $40 missing from my bank account. When I confronted him about it he admitted what he’d done. And I took my time to think about what that meant to me, because obviously I couldn’t just ignore what had happened. I definitely wasn’t going to just sit there and let him do things like that, to me or to himself. I wasn’t going to be an enabler and I wasn’t going to tie myself to that. So I took him and sat him down. And I explained that I knew he was recovering from a serious addiction and because of that I was going to forgive him for what had happened. And I also explained that I would give him two years. I wouldn’t commit to anything serious in that time, but if he could stay completely clean and sober it would show me that he was serious about our relationship. And to show him I was just as serious, I said that if he could do that, I would marry him. Now, four years later, he’s still completely sober and we’re engaged and I can say without a doubt that giving him a second chance that night was absolutely the best decision I have ever made. He is the love of my life. He never hesitates to tell me how beautiful I am or how much he loves me, and when I’m feeling bad he always does everything he possibly can to make me feel better. He is my world."},

But then on the other those very same individuals get too scared/timid to actually let others in on real emotionally intimate level. How can someone be loved unconditionally if they don't show who they truly are to others? When I say this I mean, their fears, insecurities, and doubts in the moment as well as the positives. So many go out their way to protect their own ego that they hurt those willing to want to love them for who they are. I do think a lot is because of issues with perfectionism and what it means to be attractive. It's scary to actually put yourself truly on the line like that. But by doing so makes you a fantasticaslly strong individual. To accept and understand that you are a perfectly imperfect individual takes a lot of strength, and through that strength is being vulnerable you can have a chance at unconditional love. What are your thoughts?"},
{"Title": "For 30 Years, I loved with contempt. My ex wife despised me.", "Author": "u/saffermaster", "Content": "After a few years licking my wounds, I put myself out there at age 55, trying to find love. I spent 4 years enjoying kinky sex with women of every age. From 18 to 60. Nothing I did could fill the emptiness I felt in my broken heart. One woman I dated shared with me that in spite of my sense of failure, that she found me imminently lovable. Another lover told me that I am too distant and \"You need to let me in,\" I went out and got a tattoo on my chest that took 7 months to complete. It captured my sense that attraction was possible, that there was a certain randomity to the world, that we lived in an endless universe and that I am lovable. Its a cool trash punk tattoo. I looked hard at what was missing from my marriage. It occurred to me that intimacy was missing. One day I got a message from a woman on a kink site who saw my \"seeking post\". She was as kinky as me and also looking for intimacy and we started a dialogue. We courted for 6 months before we began our dynamic formally. That was 6 years ago. in 6 days I am going to marry her. I could not be happier. We not only found love, we fell in love and have had a steamy love affair that goes on and on. I am so here for it. Its possible to find love. I can guarantee that there is love after divorce. My life is poetry. Update: Kink is interesting. People of all ages participate. There are kids who learn about kink at a very young age, and are perhaps more ready to explore kink when they get to age 18 than others are till much later in life. One thing about being Dom in a kink setting like a club or munch is that submissives of all ages and genders approach you and negotiate a scene with you. Remember, all kink is based on consent, not persuasion, informed enthusiastic consent. I should have noted that I practice RACK which is Risk-Aware Consensual Kink, and SSC, Safe, Sane Consensual Kink. I get the idea that morality has it that young adults should not play with old adults, but that is simply your own ick, nobody else's. We have a saying in kink, \"I'm not going to yuck on your yum\""},
{"Title": "A little appreciation text for my girlfriend who I love dearly", "Author": "u/Interludevol", "Content": "I love my ex girlfriend so much We’re friends now and we still talk. We don’t talk on the phone as much as we use to. We sometimes go on friendly outings. I still do my best in showing my appreciating for her in anyway I could think of. I just really want to say how proud I am of her. I’m proud everything she’s been able to achieve; before we met and after we met. I look at the casual photos I love taking of her and I think she’s so sexy, so inspiring, so beautiful, and so intelligent. She’s off the radar bro. She’s crazy to think she’s ugly if she really believes that. I seriously love this women. I love to see her laugh. I love when it’s me making her laugh. I love the way she walks. I even love when she’s nagging, I don’t mean it in any disrespectful way. For example, when she tries to convince me to take cab home instead of walking home at night and she’s super serious but I still decide to walk home, because overall I live like 15 blocks away lol. I love her nose. I love her big eyes. I love her hair. I love her forehead. I love the smudged oval  birthmark on the right side of her face. I love when shes eating. I love her fingernails. I love her toes. I love her belly. I love her family to because they are good people. I love when the hairs on her legs are growing. I love her kisses when she use to give me some. I super love her hugs and when it lasts for more than 10 seconds. I love her style. I love her charisma. I love how funny she is. I love her principles. I love her dog. I literally can go on and on. I love how she just a boss. I love her being anal about having matching sheets. I love how she’s always trying to evolve. From upgrading her standard toothbrush to an electric one 😭 or just taking care of herself and her needs. Shit I love she broke up with me because I totally respect that and respect her. At this point, i think I can care less if she gets back with me. It would hurt, yes, if she decided to move on entirely and we don’t talk anymore but part of me is just so grateful to be in her presence still and show her, even though we are friends, how much I still appreciate her. I can never convince myself things I hate about her. I’m here for her until whenever. I won’t let her go. I wish I was Superman and I could sweep her off her feet and fly her out of earth and show her the stars and planets. I will try my best to show it every chance I get to show and prove to her. I Need to use my brain and show her it’s more than the dates, the past sex, etc. I really can’t explain it but I just love the time she gives me, the care she had for me, everything yo. That’s my women still until she leaves me for good. I ain’t going no where g. I stand firm in that."},

We made our relationship official in April, so I like to think we took it pretty slow. In every other relationship I have ever had, I felt the need to be so careful about my body, my choices, and never felt at home with my partners. I always was waiting for the next step of where I was going to go to next. I made sure that we used multiple forms of protection when we were intimate. I never felt like I could be my sensitive, extroverted self fully. Before we became romantic, he helped me pass the final course I needed for my first degree. I had been calling my \"Rave Husband\", because we were always attached at the hip at the many raves we stuffed into a year. He spent the day with me after I had emergency surgery, just so I wouldn't be alone. He is one of the only people that has ever made an effort to celebrate my birthday. He got out of his car when I did, because he thought he was going to have to pull me off of some guy in front of a bar, and still decided to want me. He watched me projectile vomit outside of a show in 100 degree weather, and left early with me, and cuddled me while I looked like a drowned sewer rat months long before he declared his feelings. With this man??? I told this man today that I trust him enough to decide when and if he ever wants to put a baby in me. I told this man that I would provide for him whatever he desires in this world and then more. I made this man know I intend on marrying him and making sure that he smiles every day for the rest of his life. I let this man do things to me today that I would have never allowed anyone else do. Suddenly, just like magic, I would give him everything I am and still be searching for more to give him. Every day, I find out more about him that makes my love grow even bigger. I sat in my bedroom for hours today waiting for him to call on his work break, in shock with myself at the words that had come out of my mouth to him before he had left. Never in my life have I been down this bad for someone. Every day it gets worse. I grieve for the time in this life that I won't get to spend with him. I have never wanted to just spend a day laying around with someone. It's like I have been possessed. Somehow, I have known my best friend for over a year now and the love I have for him only continues to grow exponentially with time that I fear I may one day explode. SOS"},

It kills me every eye waking moment. I can’t stop thinking about how you may be slowly falling out of love for me and how our connection is less than what we had before. It makes me second guess everything and our relationship. Questions like Did you ever love me? Ofc you did. You stood by me when things were stressful. Your actions are louder than words, yet I think maybe you did not love me much as you thought. It’s fine, I just hate to think I’m not your person and you aren’t mine.  Why aren’t we trying to reconcile this? I mean we’re friends still so is that what that is? You said you were firm in your decision in not getting back with me. I try not to let it bother me; not cling to our little memories we had and not push away the fact you may over and done with me. I’m trying to experience the gift of life without fighting it. Yet my will is strong in not letting you go. New beginnings? Why do I feel that you’re going to eventually leave me once you find discover a new connection? It’s ideal. Is our friendship ideal?. Wishes of my life in order so that we can shine in gold and sparkle in the night time. We take it all off and we still shine. I’m sorry I ever pursued you and I wasn’t ready yet I don’t feel bad, how could I be? You allowed me to feel a feeling I never felt before. I  wish you can run to me when your heart feels heavy and lean your head on my shoulder. We had sex once after the break up and I wish you wanted my love more than you lust for sex at the moment? Is that a valid statement to say? Maybe you do want my love but baby I want all of you not just part of you. Please come home and sit still inside me because I would hate to see you come and go. Until you find someone new… I’ll be here… until you find someone new Ill be here. I just wanted to make you know how I feel although it may bug you I’m overthinking. I just wish things were different. I know you may feel different. I love you for it regardless. I love to see you prosper with or without me. It hurts but baby I’m here in the back of the ceremony rooting for you, so happy for you, I know your eyes are fixed on someone new and other things so you don’t notice me and that’s fine, here I am, happy for your accomplishments. I will forever love you as long as I know who I am and the love I have experienced. I will always pray for you and your family as I have been doing. Thank you for reading this. You don’t have to talk about anything I said. Sincerely, the boy who dreams countless lucid dreams and with you by my side, for infinity.

{"Title": "I love my boyfriend so much it hurts. He makes me so happy.", "Author": "u/sheerest_of_folly", "Content": "I know not many people will likely care to read my rant, but I love this man so fucking much. We’ve been dating for almost 3 years (anniversary in July). For 2.5 of them, we were online. Online relationships are hard. He’s in South Carolina, I was in Maryland. I decided to move to him. On the way down, on January 31st, literally 40 minutes away, my mom fell asleep at the wheel and we crashed into the moving van (she was going to drop me off, as she herself was moving to Florida with my youngest sibling. Other sibling stayed with Dad in Maryland for college.) I was the only one moderately injured in the wreck (thank God) and was taken to the hospital in an ambulance. I told my boyfriend where. He met me there. I saw my boyfriend in person for the first time while on a hospital bed. The first few months were rough for me to settle in. 21 years in Maryland in the same area my whole life was hard to transition from. My boyfriend was with me every step of the way. March was the anniversary of the deaths of several people who were important to me in my youth. They died in a car crash when I was a young teen. In Maryland, every year I would go to the playground we all played at on their deathiversary, since none of them were buried (all cremated to my knowledge). My boyfriend drove me the 500 miles to go back to Maryland to be at that playground. In April, I had a breast reduction surgery. The recovery for that was rough— for the first two weeks, I couldn’t reach my middle well enough to use the bathroom. This man wiped my pee for me, and once the anesthesia wore off, my poop too. I got my period in the second week. He learned how to put a tampon in me and take it out. He was by my side the whole time. The breast reduction was done in Maryland and we stayed with my father for a week. I’ve only seen my father cry three times: when our cat died, at the end of Star Wars (because “it’s so happy, they got the medals they worked so hard for” 💀), and when my boyfriend and I left. My father said he’s a good man and he’s so happy for us. He also gave him $400 to “pay him back” for medical expenses. My boyfriend ended up using the remainder on a date with me. Speaking of dates. I love notebooks and pens; my boyfriend doesn’t really care about those. Yet he took me on a date to Staples and Michaels, I thought to window shop but he bought so much for me. He also gets me some model skulls that I collect when he sees a cool one. Shortly after I moved in, he came home with one meant for an aquarium: “I thought of you.” I cried. We went to MomoCon this year, and he cosplayed with me. We went as Leon and Ada from the Resident Evil series (specifically the RE4 remake). He waited in line for Digimon and Pokémon voice actors with me and listened to me rant about the characters I like. We’re getting married next year. We aren’t conventionally engaged yet— he has something planned but won’t tell me— but we know we’re getting married. We just haven’t told our families yet. I’m so fucking excited and happy that this is the man I get to spend my life with."},

{"Title": "A little story of how I met the girl I’ve been talking to.", "Author": "u/Zealousideal_Ad321", "Content": "Sorry, this will be long, but very worth the read. The feeling of new love is so euphoric, I just have to share. We have decided not to put a label on what we have going on, so I don’t consider her my girlfriend by any means. I broke up with an ex of 1 year about a month and a half ago, and since about 4 weeks ago, me and this girl have been talking more than before, and hanging out. I never even thought about flirting or making a move, because I was in the process of getting out of a relationship I felt stuck in. More than anyone else, she helped me understand what was wrong with my relationship and would always give pointers on how to make relationships more successful. I had given up on love. For months before I broke up with my ex, me and this girl talked all the time about love. I explained to her many many times that I’ve lost faith in relationships. My ex of 5 years cheated on me along with physical abuse. My ex after that started acting like my other ex(very violent) and I decided that no one should ever feel threatened by their partner, even if they haven’t taken a swing yet. This girl explained to me that life is about taking chances and dating shouldn’t be ruled out just yet. Always kind of hinting at the thought of us being together. I work as a CNA in a long term care facility and she does the same PRN. We don’t work together much, but everytime we have, it seems like every one of our coworkers seem to think we were together. It’s not just our coworkers, the residents we take care of hint at it and tease us both about dating each other. A week or so after I broke up with my ex, I was on the phone with her. We talked about what went wrong and why I had bad luck with dating before. She kept expressing to not lose hope. The next day we worked together and while we were changing residents/doing vitals etc, she kept sort of bumping into me. She would stand really close when we talked and never took her eye off me. I knew what was happening and I wasn’t about to let my insecurities pass this off. We started talking about taking it super slow in a relationship being the best choice. She mentions she wouldn’t mind doing something like that and I say the same. To hang out, talk all the time, whatever couples do, just not labeling it. We figure that’s the best way to do things, except that we’ve already knew each other for 11 months that I’ve been working with her and have became very good friends. When she brings this up I knew for a fact that she wanted to go out with me, so I asked her if she wanted to come have some drinks and watch some movies at my house. She very quickly agreed and we made a date to hang out. When the time comes, she shows up at my house, like an hour late(she had a good excuse) and we start talking. We put on a movie but not a second of it was watched. We just talked and talked. I knew I couldn’t chicken out and not make a move, and I also knew that with her being very shy, there was no way she was going to make a move. Everytime I got up from the couch to grab another beer or make her a drink, I would sit closer and closer when I got back to the couch. At this point I’ve had 2 or 3 beers and I was starting to feel my intuition slip away. Even if she tells me she doesn’t like me like that, I’ll be able to defend my actions and apologize, so what’s to lose? I had this overwhelming feeling that I misunderstood all of our talks and all the hints, all the things residents and coworkers have said. I felt like she wasn’t comfortable and that I was going to make a big mistake if I were to make a move.  After making her a drink and sitting down right next to her, were our arms are touching, I throw my arm around her and she sinks into me, holding me, like she’s been waiting 11 months for this. I’ve never felt so exhilarated in my life. I figured I’ve got it in the bag, so I lean in to kiss her and she grabs my face and pulls it closer. We ended up making out for quite some time before she had to leave for work in the morning. I felt very very happy about this and high on life. Within a couple days we had already set up another time for us to hang out. I decided we should go on a hike, then back to my house. That was very successful as well and I felt like there was nothing stopping us from continuing this. She’s been on vacation for the last 2 weeks but we plan to go camping next Wednesday and Thursday on an island. We have so much in common and she is absolutely stunning. I can’t mess this up, but I at least know for sure that even if it doesn’t work out, we will still be great friends. Thank you for all that came to listen , have a great day!"},

The tears on your face as we said I love you for the last time are forever imprinted in my memory. You don't know how badly I wanted to wipe them away, kiss your forehead, and promise you it would be okay. I knew I couldn't, because then I would never get out of your car. I've been trying to keep myself busy. Started going to the gym every day instead of every other. It hasn't really helped too much, but it's nice to keep my mind off you for a few hours. I stare at my bare ring finger more often than I should. I still instinctively go to grab my ring off my dresser when I wake up every morning, even though it's not there anymore. Everything makes me think of you. The cicadas chirping makes me think of us laughing when you told me they keep getting caught in your windshield. The news reminds me of our long drives where we would discuss politics and everything going on in the world. Every outfit I put on reminds me of when I would wear it with you. Inside Out 2 comes out in two days! I hope you're as excited as I am. I know we've been planning for months on watching it together on opening night. A part of me wonders if we'll be watching it at the same time at different theatres, laughing and crying at the same parts of it. Honestly, I'm probably just going to cry through this whole thing as I wish you were by my side while I watch. Maybe I'll wait to see it until I feel ready. I hope you still get to see it, though. I can't stop living in the \"what ifs\" of it all. What could have been different, what could have changed. I yearn for you. My heart feels half empty. I know it's unhealthy to live in the past, but the only way I've been able to fall asleep at night is when I replay our old memories in our head. Even then, I wake up in the middle of the night gasping and imagining the past few days have just been some fucked up nightmare. I had to mute your number, because every time my phone buzzed, deep down I hoped it was you. Even still, I find myself constantly looking at the little red numbers above the texting app, hoping it goes up by one. The amount of times I dialed your number just to not hit call is pathetic. I just need to hear your voice. I know this yearning is unhealthy, but I don't know when it will go away. I miss your smile, and the way your nose scrunches when you're really happy. I miss your silky black hair and your mocha skin. I miss your dark brown eyes that I would constantly get lost in. I miss your touch and I miss your kisses. I miss feeling the tightness when you squeeze me when we hug. I miss hearing your heart beat when I rest my head on your chest. I remember the first time I ever did that way back when we first staring dating and I could feel it racing, it made me blush. I miss your gentle voice and your roaring laugh. I miss our deep talks and our petty gossip. I even miss our fights, as dumb as that sounds. I just miss everything. It's been hard to scroll through social media because anytime I see something that reminds me of you, I want to send it to you. I've been sending them to my own number instead. In fact, to be honest, I've been texting my own number a lot. Whenever I want to text you, I just text it to myself. It still cuts like glass when the message immediately bounces back. Anyway, my eyes are getting misty so I'll stop here. Goodbye, my love. Maybe in another life, we'll do things right. I love you infinity plus one, ha I win."},

She told me she’d done some research online and wanted to go to Rigby & Peller at Bluewater shopping center in Kent. We drove there that evening, and I left her for half an hour to have a fitting appointment. I left her with my credit card and wandered around the shops for a while. I came back and waited outside the shop for her once it’d been about 25 minutes. She came out with the bra packaged inside a cord-handled bag. She was beaming with excitement. We sat down briefly and she showed me how they’d carefully wrapped it in tissue paper for her. As we drove home I just remember her telling me how comfortable it was when she tried it on , how the sales assistant had made her feel positive about it, and how special it made her feel. She told me the same thing a few times but I loved every moment of it. She’d never had a properly fitted bra before and it’s an experience that I think I enjoyed more just listening to how happy it made her 🥹"},

I was in a temporary situation with someone and before it started we both agreed it had a countdown because we both would be moving to very different places quite soon and there's little to no chance of crossing paths after. All was understood and glad this was clear and upfront, but after it ended I came to a strange realization. Compared to all flings or real relationships (some more healthy/successful than others) I've had in the past it was the most authentic affection I've received so far. And the most I've wanted to give affection in return. I'm not particularly sad or regretful in any way cause I knew the conditions, but I'm startled that I can confidently say a less than two month fling felt more honest and caring than any previous entanglement had. I don't think it's because it is more fresh in my mind, just to state. I guess I just always felt like I did more or more was always expected from me than was ever given. I guess I'm wondering how it's possible that the most mature and earnest experience of positive emotional expression (non-platonic) I've had so far came from something so simple and short lived ?"},

His smile makes my heart melt and I've never been more interested in what anyone has to say than when he's talking about something he's passionate about. I feel so safe in his presence and I sleep better with him than I ever have. We've been talking about getting married for the past couple months and he's confirmed that he plans on getting me an engagement ring soon, and with our anniversary coming up at the end of the month I feel like it'll be around then. Plus, I saw him looking up rings. And I'm so excited. Whether he does it now or later, I'm just happy to know I'll be spending the rest of my life with him. I don't care about a big wedding or anything like that. I just can't wait to call him my husband, and to hear him call me his wife. Love, in all forms, is what makes life truly worth living. Connection, and shared experiences. Self love. The love of being a parent, or being a child. Closeness with your family, or building your own chosen family. Friendships, marriages, and pets. This is what it's about. And I'm eternally grateful to be filled with an infinite amount of love, and especially grateful to feel it back. ❤️"},

I don't understand \"romantic expectations\" like sex or how your life goal according to society should be to get in a romantic relationship. I don't understand so much about \"love\" or affection, at least now how society views it, and I want to understand. I have a partner and I care about them very much. I feel about them differently than I do other people. I'd be okay sharing a life with them and doing things together. But, I don't feel that strong desire for certain romantic things. I love sending them gifts, calling them, and doing things together. I love being there for them and comforting them. I'm always proud of them.

I've gone back and forth on if I should tell this story, but I'm a writer at heart and putting thoughts and emotions to words is how I work through it all, and maybe someone will read this and feel something, also so all the kids out there know that love is never simple, and you are bound to get caught up in it even well into your adult years. So back in January I met lets call her N, and we instantly connected. Like she called me the night after our coffee date to talk more, it was just so comfortable, we texted every day, called few times a week. Within a couple weeks we'd been on three more dates and made things official, after that we spent every weekend either at her place or mine, and occasionally got together during the week too. N and I have a dozen things in common, specific video games, humor, movies, and even our obscure fashion and interior design choices match. We shared personal, private pains. Before two months were up she had told me she loved me, I'd told her I was getting there, I had met her friends more than once, and we both had told our parents about each other. It seemed like a beautiful beginning. But then it ended suddenly. She had a bout of insecurities and she felt like she didn't deserve me, I couldn't convince her I was happy with her, and she ended things. But neither of us wanted the other out of our lives. We continued to talk every day, call each other, and we still regularly got together in person. After more than a month it looked from my side like we could start again, but N had an old long distance friend. This guy had never been too happy we were dating, and had decided now was a good time to come down and see N for the first time in years. I had an opportunity to tell N how I truly felt before he showed up, N and I had gone out drinking the night before he arrived, and though she showed doubt about what she wanted from her old friend, there was wonder too. So rather than throw an emotional bomb at her the night before, I kept my silence. I told her a week later, though I knew she had decided to be with him. I told her, not to confuse or ask anything of her, simply because she deserved to know. Her old insecurities had been wrong, and I still wanted to be a part of her life. She was not happy. Mad that I had taken so long to feel what she had felt months earlier, mad that I hadn't said anything that last night, mad that she thought I was only pretending to be friends, and even still insecure that I could still want someone like her in my life. That was only a month ago, and to this day we talk everyday, call at least once a week, and see each other nearly every week. We are both excited for an upcoming con, a game release later this year, and she expressed wanting to go to renn faire with me still. She is fast becoming my best friend, and I honestly am so happy I met her, I don't regret a thing. I don't know what the future holds, I'm casually looking for another partner, but mainly on bettering myself. We may or may not ever get back together, but I hope that in five years we are still talking every day, and getting together once a week to see each other. Love is beautiful in all forms, even at times in heartbreak and lost potential."},

I’ve been seeing her for almost a year and I’m still anticipating someone popping out with a camera crew to let me know it’s all been a set up, but it never happens. I tried dating apps and asking people out for the better part of a decade not really feeling much of a connection or finding a spark that fizzled out quickly. In the last couple years I realized I was asexual. The general population is less than 1% ace, and of that one percent you’re lucky if you find 1 or 2 people you have something in common with. When I saw her dating profile I was floored. Someone who was more like me than anyone I’d ever seen on any dating app, ace, and incredibly beautiful. We hit it off pretty quickly through text chat and quickly moved to phone calls. We have similar niche hobbies, asthetics, work in the same industry, similar off brand humor, politics, values, and so many more things. She’s hilarious, nerdy, an incredible artist talented beyond her years, jaw dropping beautiful, smart, affectionate and caring. I have so many overwhelming feelings about her and our time together so far, like on our first date when she held my arm as we drunkenly walked the city streets looking at an festival market and playing ski ball together at the arcade, or our second date having a picnic in the botanical gardens, looking at all the Christmas lights in town til dark and doing star gazing. It’s been almost a year of dating and every one we go one seems impossibly magical  putting rom coms to shame. We spend a few evenings each week playing board games online, cracking jokes and telling each other about what’s going on in our lives. It’s been like finding a new best friend who I can also cuddle and shower with admiration. I’m mostly writing this because I can’t see her immediately and need to vent all this loving energy somewhere. I can’t wait til I get to see her again, sharing time with her just makes that time so much brighter!"},

We had mutuals so we would come around each other when our friends had kickbacks etc. I began to pursue him because I thought he was cute and liked him. Eventually he showed me that he reciprocated so we began to date and go out. We would go to sports games out to dinners & he would come over often to swim etc.  we had a real strong connection and all- This all happened so fast, but we were young and in love. even though I wanted him to make me his girlfriend he never did because he didn't know that I wanted that. Eventually I got back with my ex & we decided to stay as \"friends\". Obviously the relationship with my ex didn't work out and we ended up breaking up indefinitely. I continued to live my life, but I couldn't help but not being able to stop thinking about the one that got away. It has been years since we've talked and yet I feel like this- wondering what if?  One night while drinking with my friends I got the balls to reach out to him (the one who got away). I tried to rekindle our relationship and at first he was for it. He was a bit hesitant and still had a wall up which was understandable, but gradually he was letting me in. We decided we were going to take it slow and we were not girlfriend and boyfriend yet, but I was happy and content with how it was going. I was growing as a person in different aspects of my life and wanted him to be apart of it all. Sometime later that month I went hiking with my best friend that I call Main Squeeze, babe, bae all of the above (she’s been my bestie since middle school). We were making it a habit of going hiking every weekend. One Saturday when we went hiking, I posted on Twitter \"going hiking with bae\" & he saw it and immediately unfollowed me and ghosted me. l know from his perspective it seemed wrong, but I was seriously hiking with my best friend. Looking back now obvi that was stupid to do but I was young and dumb. Me being young, dumb and immature, I didn't think to reach out to him and I just let it be. I was being stubborn that he unfollowed me and left it as is. I never got to explain myself or tell him that it was only my best friend I was hiking with. Here I am 8 years later still thinking of him and now he was the one that got away. I keep thinking of where life could've taken us & how happy we could've been. It makes me sad because I want him to see the person that I am today, (grown with an education, car own place etc), I still have things I can work on & those are all materialistic things but I have worked so hard for the person I am today. I’m so proud of the woman I am today and wish he could be apart of this chapter of my life. Maybe a year or two after that incident I reached out to him through text. At that time he was in a relationship so he just responded with \" maybe you shouldn't be texting me lol\" I said OK and left it as is. Fast forward to today they are no longer together, that relationship did not last long and as far as I know he is single. I brought this up to my therapist and she encouraged me to maybe reach out now to just express my feelings and where I'm at right now, to do it now while we're single and not committed to anything. She said that might be easier because time will pass and if I wait for more time for us to be in committed relationships or even married with a family to then even think about reaching out will be difficult. So should I do it? Should I reach out? I don't want to be a bother. I don't want to be a fool or make a fool of myself. Should I just let it be and continue to live my life how l've been? It has been years since we've talked and yet I feel like this wondering what if?"},

But before I got clean I met this girl and me and her hit it off pretty well. I decided that I'd stop the random sex with strangers with my drug habit since honestly that usually went hand and hand. Now I want to say I've done my fair share of drugs and I will always have a special place in my heart for psychedelics. That's the one thing I'll probably always do, and maybe ecstasy on very special occasions. I also am a huge fan and supporter of DMT. With that said me and girl spend a lot of time together and she's actually the first person I fell in love with. Like from the moment we first hung out we hit it off like no one I've ever met. It feels like I've always known her. And my favorite thing to do with her is hug... I know it sounds dumb but like for real, I love sex, I love kissing her, I love making her feel special, but like I REAAAALY love just hugging her. She gives the best hugs and they make me feel AMAZING. Last night we hugged for a solid 30 or 40 minutes. Just on the beach under the cloudy moon lit sky. Dancing and stumbling all over the cool sand but never breaking our embrace. Hardcore hugging, like full on face buried in shoulder standing in the rain hugging. She holds me like she never wants to let go. And tbh I don't ever want her to! Keep in mind that I'm sober, but I felt kinda like I'm rolling, but not as intense but still like it was crazy. I actually feel high when I'm hugging her. Before I met her I was sure that nothing could make me feel as good as heroin, but then she came along. Things are going so well we're just in total bliss.

I’m a SAHM and night shift is not fun but every morning he lets me sleep him while he manages to work from home and take care of our toddler and newborn. He is constantly cleaning or helping me clean and takes over dinner 2-3 times a week. He gives me time to myself when my day is overwhelming and never makes me feel bad for it. Our communication has been so good and it’s easy to just say what is on my mind without worrying about how he will react. And the cherry on top of it all is the fact that I prefer to sleep with my hair braided, but I can’t braid. So every night he comes in the bathroom while I’m brushing my teeth and braids it for me. It’s the things he does that make me so happy. I really appreciate him."},

My partner (F 18) is asleep next to me and just looking at her, I know there’s nothing I wouldn’t do for her, I want to be there protecting her from anything that might hurt her, and I feel protected by her, I love her with absolutely everything that I have.

{"Title": "My boyfriend made me cry happy tears for the first time in my life.", "Author": "u/xduckymoox", "Content": "This happened while we were on the phone late at night, somewhere in the AM. I love listening to him, and he enjoys telling stories, so I laid there with my blanket wrapped around me, listening to him tell me different sweet and happy stories. I felt so comfortable and safe in that moment, like nothing could go wrong. It was such a warm, nice feeling. I told him this, saying how safe, comfortable, and happy I felt. In response, he started saying such kind things. He told me things like: \"You're safe now.\" \"I won't let anything hurt you.\" and \"You can rest now.\" I've never been told anything like this before. My whole life, I've been used to abuse and hurt. To hear such simple yet kind sentences as these... shook me to my core. I started crying. Words like that were so foreign. They didn't feel like words I was meant to hear, yet he was telling me them. He began comforting me as I wept softly, but I was mainly holding back. I've never been good at crying in front of anyone. I made a small, joking comment through the tears like, \"I wonder how much I'd cry if I didn't hold back.\" In response, he told me not to hold back, and to just let myself cry and feel the emotions. And so I did. Crying has always been a painful thing for me. When I cry, there's a genuine pain deep in my stomach and it makes me cry out both from the sheer mental pain and from the physical pain. It's like the deep hurt I have bottled up takes physical form. Yet this crying was... gentle. There was no pain, no crying out. Just... happiness. I've never cried happy tears for anything, but in that moment, with the tears streaming down my face and clouding my eyes, that's all I felt. As I listened to his soothing voice tell me everything was going to be okay and that he wouldn't let anything hurt me, I was genuinely happy. For almost 2 hours afterward, I sobbed as he told me these kind words. I think a part of me healed that night. The part that didn't think it would ever be possible for me to be treated with this kind of kindness and love. The part of me who didn't think I deserved any. And all I felt was relief. Relief both at so much built up pain being alleviated that night, and at the fact that I have someone who loves me enough to help me deal with this pain. It was that night that I realized just how much I really loved him. There's nobody else I'd rather spend the rest of my life with, and I know he's the amazing man I'll marry some day."},

I remember the first time I saw him I thought he was so attractive, everyone else who knew him was so excited to see him so he seemed very friendly and personable. Fast-forward to where we are at now and I could have never imagined my life turning out like it is now. I stay with him about 90% of the time and every time I look at him I want to physically cry from how happy I am. I can't remember the last time I have felt this genuinely happy. I recently went through a bad concussion that affected my blood pressure (weird, I know) and I could barely even walk ten feet without nearly passing out which meant I couldn't work out like I'm use to and that was super hard for me. I spent so much time crying from stress/pain and all that and he never left my side if he didn't have to. He was overly caring and I had never felt so loved in my life. His parents were even calling to check in on me and I had never felt like a partner's parents had cared so much. Everytime I look at my bf I am amazed at how lucky I got to be with him. I love watching him play his video games and seeing him so happy. His laugh is the best sound to me and he always hold me so tightly. I love going with him to run little errands because I love being able to be seen with him in public. He will always give me butterflies and I have never felt my heart so full for someone.

We never had said this to each other, so she instantly turned red and it looked like she was shocked that it just slipped out. I asked her if she really meant it and she said, yes I do, which made her turn even more red. I felt totally no doubt at all and I told her I loved her too. We both started smiling at each other and I kissed her. I felt such a warm feeling from inside, I never felt something like it.

{"Title": "IT HAPPENED, WE FINALLY SAID I LOVE YOU!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!", "Author": "Unknown author", "Content": "Ahhhhhhhhh So it finally happened. My girlfriend and I have been together for a little over 6 months and have known each other for a year. Due to it being her sister's birthday and a holiday the following week, I decided to plan a celebration this weekend. I made her a little trailer to advertise our anniversary. I used the Black Widow trailer and near the end, it cuts to me with a photo collage of us together and advertising our two-night event. The first night was okay, the internet made the video quality of our video call grainy and it kept cutting in and out. Even with that, I sent her the mixtape I made her (with songs that we both shared) and she loved it! Okay, moving on to the big event. Yesterday was our big event and after discussing our relationship and how far we've come, she told me she had a surprise for me at 11:59pm. Woah. I told her I did too (maybe a mistake on my part because she was expecting something, DARN IT!!!) and we danced, watched a movie and played games to pass the time. So, at 12:01am, after freshening up in the bathroom we got to the bathroom. I got back to the phone and after a little pause, she says \"I kinda, sorta, am 100% in love with you.\" She sent me her beautiful gift and I was happy! Then, I asked if it was my turn to share with her and she said yes. I prepared a four page speech (which was going to actually be a letter, but I just decided to read it to her). In the letter, it was very personal and heartfelt. I told her I love her. She, teary-eyed, paused and said...\"I love you too.\" I cried, we all cried. It was sooooo beautiful. She then said \"I knew since February.\" *sobs* We spent the rest of the night talking about the ways we were planning on saying it. Then we went to sleep at the same time, we didn't hang up and we woke up and continued the conversation. I will never forget this special moment. Thank you so much, V. I love you so much!

{"Title": "I’m thinking of ending my marriage of nearly two decades", "Author": "Unknown author", "Content": "I met the love of my life, knew I was going to marry her from the moment I saw her. Fought for her and married her less than a year later. My life was complete. I was the happiest guy on earth. This lasted for 10 years where I knew we had the kind of bond you see in movies. Nothing could ever tear us apart. It was us against the world. Then we decided to start a family. Immediately after she gave birth her whole demeanour towards me changed overnight. Gone were the constant moments of affection, the closeness we had on a daily basis, the sex, everything. I put it down to hormonal changes as giving birth is a big ordeal after all, and I gave her time. Lots of time. When after 3 years nothing changed, I sat her down and told her how I felt and how she made me feel. Like I was a stranger in my own house. Like I was living with a room mate who were only acquaintances with no romantic ties, hell without a proper friendship. I was expecting her to say she didn’t feel the same about me anymore, but to my surprise she said she hadn’t noticed!! She said she would try harder, and that was that. Nothing changed and we continued our surreal coexistence where nothing made sense to me. I suggested we see a marriage councillor to try and help. At first she agreed, but when d-day arrived she refused to take part. Fast forward another 3 years and I’m at my wits end. Unconditional love has turned into resentment. Joyful moments throughout the day where we exchanged a kiss or a touch or even a look has turned into a depressing nightmare for me where I feel utterly rejected and useless as a husband. I feel like the only reason I’m still needed is when I have to do things for her. Like fix her car, or build her some furniture or run errands. I don’t get anything in return that makes it feel worthwhile to be married to her anymore. I don’t ask for much. All I want is my wife back, to feel wanted and loved. But I’m getting nothing. At this point the resentment has grown so much that I don’t think I could trust it even if she magically decided to treat me like she used to. So here I am contemplating ending our marriage. Not because there’s someone else. I don’t know if I could ever trust anyone else. All I know is I will be happier on my own because I won’t be reminded every day of what my life used to be like. The only thing stopping me is our daughter. She is the light of my life and I would rather be unhappy so she doesn’t have to be. She loves us both equally and she knows something is up because she is forever trying to bring us closer together, even though she’s only 6. People say it’s better for kids if break up with your partner than be in a toxic relationship around them. And I agree. The only thing is we are perfectly pleasant towards one another. We never fight or scream and shout. My wife seems perfectly happy with the current arrangement as she is always on a high. And I would be over the moon for her, but not at my expense and my happiness. I’m thinking I should give this a final chance and say to her I’m about to end it unless she agrees to some councilling, to see if this marriage can be saved. Other than that I don’t see what other options I have but to walk out of this marriage. Love was always enough for me. It was my only requirement, and without it I have no reason to stay. If anyone has any insight or went through something similar I would be grateful for a bit of guidance as it scares the shit out of me."},

{"Title": "A stranger on a plane told me to never leave my boyfriend and it was one of the most heart warming interactions I’ve ever had with someone I didn’t know.", "Author": "u/tahaf", "Content": "So my boyfriend and I were flying together back home. I, having the bad luck I normally do, was seated in the very back row on a small express plane. My boyfriend was seated very close to the front. We decided that we’d try to move but if not then it wouldn’t be a big deal since our flight was a little under 3 hours. I had settled in and so did he so it was safe to assume I’d be stuck next to an already snoring old man. My boyfriend was seated next to a very sociable New Yorker and they were getting along quite well. Just before take of the man seated next to my boyfriend came walking down the aisle repeating “Number 14C! Number 14C! It’s your lucky day, you get to go seat by your man”  I started to laugh and thanked him then moved up to join my boyfriend. During the majority of the plane ride we listened to music together and I slept on his shoulder. I noticed a few times (especially during landing and the process of exiting the plane) this older woman seated near us staring at us for long periods of time. It kind of got excessive and I was tempted to ask her if she was ok or something... We finally get off the plane and I head towards the closest bathroom. I’m washing my hands and at the sink right next to me is that same lady. She then tells me “you’re boyfriend is so sweet to you.. he really is so very sweet to you..” she had tears in her eyes while she spoke. “I haven’t seen that kind of love in so long... my husband passed away one year ago today so I just felt like I needed to tell you. I know I don’t really know you guys but if eyes could speak you two look at each other the same way I did with my husband and we were married over 41 years. He’s a keeper, don’t let him go. It’s hard to find someone who looks at you the way he does and says the things he said to get you to seat next to him on the plane. It was truly beautiful...” I still have no clue what my boyfriend said to get the guy to switch seats with me but honestly what that woman shared with me made my heart grow 100 times."},

Gosh I just want to keep kissing her, holding her and telling her she's perfect. We're in a long distance but we've met a lot of times but never enough. I'm just glad she stuck with me so far and even more, I'm just glad she chose the dorkiest idiot and said \"yep. That's mine\" I love, appreciate, and look up to her.

He came for my prom and when I say I’ve never felt so in love I mean it. The whole time I felt like we were the only people there and I couldn’t stop looking at him. He was so affectionate and calling me perfect and “more beautiful in person” and be was so patient about everything including our first kiss, which made me like him 1000x more. I think we touched foreheads about 5 times trying to go for the first kiss but I kept backing out LOL. After the first one, the rest were so easy. He was complimenting me all night and hugging me every second and kissing all over my forehead and cheek and neck but I loved that I could tell it was endearing and not sexual. Like I literally FELT the affection radiating off of him. On the dance floor we were hugging and I was leaning back on him and he just stayed there for me even tho he HATES dancing and swore off of it. He spent 60% of the night there for me, which I’m very grateful for. His smile was so genuine and he would look at me and ask for a kiss over and over it was so cute dude. Everything physical he took his time w, which btw didnt go far but like what we did do he was so gentle with and asked “can I……..” “yes or no?” I found it so adorable in the moment. ik it’s bare minimum but it’s just a relief and honestly blessing knowing he cares how I feel in the moment and thinks about me when he’s horny ig? 😭 Like seriously, even our tongue kiss was so gentle. I was so nervous and he was like “for one second, I’ll teach you,” and not in a demanding way but more question and care. I did it and then did it 1-2 more times for a couple seconds and got embarrassed and dug my head into his chest bc I thought I was doing really bad, and then I just like mumbled “I don’t know what to do or how to do it..” and he reassured me the second after and was saying “nooooo it was good….baby it was perfect, I swear.” and I was blushing the WHOLE TIME. Anyways, after the bus ride back and cute I just kinda laid on his shoulder and almost passed out on his lap bc I was so exhausted and we took a drive to Dave and busters but he had to leave early, sadly. I think one of the cutest things was him saying “the pictures please, the PhotoBooth and card” bc I had taken a picture for us and made us save each others table cards and him remembering and saying it in the actual most adorable voice, not like a baby but like imagine a grown man or deep voiced guy just saying it so softly. Then he said I love you and I’ll miss you and we kissed goodbye 🙁. Now, I’m going to his house in a week or two for his pool and we’re gonna have fun in there there watch a movie together and cuddle in our matching pjs and build a lego set I bought us. I’m so happy so have stuck through the long year of petty fights and lack of touch bc it was all worth it. Our 15 months is in 6 days, it feels surreal. I’m gonna marry this man, mark my words."},

This happened early on in our relationship, a little under four years ago. When we met my guy was starting his recovery from a serious meth addiction and as you can imagine I didn’t want to be involved with that, at all. So even though we had a serious connection I kept turning him down because I didn’t want to take any chances there, but after about six months of getting to know him I finally broke down and kissed him. We got together, and things were great. Then about six more months into our relationship there was one bad day where he wasn’t acting like himself and he was out hanging out with some guys I didn’t know, and I ended up finding $40 missing from my bank account. When I confronted him about it he admitted what he’d done. And I took my time to think about what that meant to me, because obviously I couldn’t just ignore what had happened. I definitely wasn’t going to just sit there and let him do things like that, to me or to himself. I wasn’t going to be an enabler and I wasn’t going to tie myself to that. So I took him and sat him down. And I explained that I knew he was recovering from a serious addiction and because of that I was going to forgive him for what had happened. And I also explained that I would give him two years. I wouldn’t commit to anything serious in that time, but if he could stay completely clean and sober it would show me that he was serious about our relationship. And to show him I was just as serious, I said that if he could do that, I would marry him. Now, four years later, he’s still completely sober and we’re engaged and I can say without a doubt that giving him a second chance that night was absolutely the best decision I have ever made. He is the love of my life. He never hesitates to tell me how beautiful I am or how much he loves me, and when I’m feeling bad he always does everything he possibly can to make me feel better. He is my world."},

We each have a computer in here, and there is also a bed for napping. Just before I moved here two months ago, he set up Apple Home using Siri. One of Siri's skills is to play music all over the house when we ask her to. As we are both working at our computers, listening to music, the song \"In the Arms of the Angels\" starts to play. My wonderful, loving partner knew that song would trigger intense grief in me and make me cry. As soon as it started playing, he stood up, came to my computer, put his arms around me and said, \"Come on, let's go snuggle.\" I was already crying. My partner led me to the bed, pulled me into his arms, told Siri to stop the music, held me, and talked to me about my son until I stopped crying. I have never felt so loved.

{"Title": "I find emotional intimacy difficult in many ways.

But then on the other those very same individuals get too scared/timid to actually let others in on real emotionally intimate level. How can someone be loved unconditionally if they don't show who they truly are to others? When I say this I mean, their fears, insecurities, and doubts in the moment as well as the positives. So many go out their way to protect their own ego that they hurt those willing to want to love them for who they are. I do think a lot is because of issues with perfectionism and what it means to be attractive. It's scary to actually put yourself truly on the line like that. But by doing so makes you a fantasticaslly strong individual. To accept and understand that you are a perfectly imperfect individual takes a lot of strength, and through that strength is being vulnerable you can have a chance at unconditional love.

I just really want to say how proud I am of her. I’m proud everything she’s been able to achieve; before we met and after we met. I look at the casual photos I love taking of her and I think she’s so sexy, so inspiring, so beautiful, and so intelligent. She’s off the radar bro. She’s crazy to think she’s ugly if she really believes that. I seriously love this women. I love to see her laugh. I love when it’s me making her laugh. I love the way she walks. I even love when she’s nagging, I don’t mean it in any disrespectful way. For example, when she tries to convince me to take cab home instead of walking home at night and she’s super serious but I still decide to walk home, because overall I live like 15 blocks away lol. I love her nose. I love her big eyes. I love her hair. I love her forehead. I love the smudged oval  birthmark on the right side of her face. I love when shes eating. I love her fingernails. I love her toes. I love her belly. I love her family to because they are good people. I love when the hairs on her legs are growing. I love her kisses when she use to give me some. I super love her hugs and when it lasts for more than 10 seconds. I love her style. I love her charisma. I love how funny she is. I love her principles. I love her dog. I literally can go on and on. I love how she just a boss. I love her being anal about having matching sheets. I love how she’s always trying to evolve. From upgrading her standard toothbrush to an electric one 😭 or just taking care of herself and her needs. Shit I love she broke up with me because I totally respect that and respect her. At this point, i think I can care less if she gets back with me. It would hurt, yes, if she decided to move on entirely and we don’t talk anymore but part of me is just so grateful to be in her presence still and show her, even though we are friends, how much I still appreciate her. I can never convince myself things I hate about her. I’m here for her until whenever. I won’t let her go. I wish I was Superman and I could sweep her off her feet and fly her out of earth and show her the stars and planets. I will try my best to show it every chance I get to show and prove to her. I Need to use my brain and show her it’s more than the dates, the past sex, etc. I really can’t explain it but I just love the time she gives me, the care she had for me, everything yo. That’s my women still until she leaves me for good. I ain’t going no where g. I stand firm in that."},
{"Title": "For 30 Years, I loved with contempt. My ex wife despised me.", "Author": "u/saffermaster", "Content": "After a few years licking my wounds, I put myself out there at age 55, trying to find love. I spent 4 years enjoying kinky sex with women of every age. From 18 to 60. Nothing I did could fill the emptiness I felt in my broken heart. One woman I dated shared with me that in spite of my sense of failure, that she found me imminently lovable. Another lover told me that I am too distant and \"You need to let me in,\" I went out and got a tattoo on my chest that took 7 months to complete. It captured my sense that attraction was possible, that there was a certain randomity to the world, that we lived in an endless universe and that I am lovable. Its a cool trash punk tattoo. I looked hard at what was missing from my marriage. It occurred to me that intimacy was missing. One day I got a message from a woman on a kink site who saw my \"seeking post\". She was as kinky as me and also looking for intimacy and we started a dialogue. We courted for 6 months before we began our dynamic formally. That was 6 years ago. in 6 days I am going to marry her. I could not be happier. We not only found love, we fell in love and have had a steamy love affair that goes on and on. I am so here for it. Its possible to find love. I can guarantee that there is love after divorce. My life is poetry. Update: Kink is interesting. People of all ages participate. There are kids who learn about kink at a very young age, and are perhaps more ready to explore kink when they get to age 18 than others are till much later in life. One thing about being Dom in a kink setting like a club or munch is that submissives of all ages and genders approach you and negotiate a scene with you. Remember, all kink is based on consent, not persuasion, informed enthusiastic consent. I should have noted that I practice RACK which is Risk-Aware Consensual Kink, and SSC, Safe, Sane Consensual Kink. I get the idea that morality has it that young adults should not play with old adults, but that is simply your own ick, nobody else's. We have a saying in kink, \"I'm not going to yuck on your yum\""},

We made our relationship official in April, so I like to think we took it pretty slow. In every other relationship I have ever had, I felt the need to be so careful about my body, my choices, and never felt at home with my partners. I always was waiting for the next step of where I was going to go to next. I made sure that we used multiple forms of protection when we were intimate. I never felt like I could be my sensitive, extroverted self fully. Before we became romantic, he helped me pass the final course I needed for my first degree. I had been calling my \"Rave Husband\", because we were always attached at the hip at the many raves we stuffed into a year. He spent the day with me after I had emergency surgery, just so I wouldn't be alone. He is one of the only people that has ever made an effort to celebrate my birthday. He got out of his car when I did, because he thought he was going to have to pull me off of some guy in front of a bar, and still decided to want me. He watched me projectile vomit outside of a show in 100 degree weather, and left early with me, and cuddled me while I looked like a drowned sewer rat months long before he declared his feelings. With this man??? I told this man today that I trust him enough to decide when and if he ever wants to put a baby in me. I told this man that I would provide for him whatever he desires in this world and then more. I made this man know I intend on marrying him and making sure that he smiles every day for the rest of his life. I let this man do things to me today that I would have never allowed anyone else do. Suddenly, just like magic, I would give him everything I am and still be searching for more to give him. Every day, I find out more about him that makes my love grow even bigger. I sat in my bedroom for hours today waiting for him to call on his work break, in shock with myself at the words that had come out of my mouth to him before he had left. Never in my life have I been down this bad for someone. Every day it gets worse. I grieve for the time in this life that I won't get to spend with him. I have never wanted to just spend a day laying around with someone. It's like I have been possessed. Somehow, I have known my best friend for over a year now and the love I have for him only continues to grow exponentially with time that I fear I may one day explode. SOS"},

It makes me second guess everything and our relationship. Questions like Did you ever love me? Ofc you did. You stood by me when things were stressful. Your actions are louder than words, yet I think maybe you did not love me much as you thought. It’s fine, I just hate to think I’m not your person and you aren’t mine.  Why aren’t we trying to reconcile this? I mean we’re friends still so is that what that is? You said you were firm in your decision in not getting back with me. I try not to let it bother me; not cling to our little memories we had and not push away the fact you may over and done with me. I’m trying to experience the gift of life without fighting it. Yet my will is strong in not letting you go. New beginnings? Why do I feel that you’re going to eventually leave me once you find discover a new connection? It’s ideal. Is our friendship ideal?. Wishes of my life in order so that we can shine in gold and sparkle in the night time. We take it all off and we still shine. I’m sorry I ever pursued you and I wasn’t ready yet I don’t feel bad, how could I be? You allowed me to feel a feeling I never felt before. I  wish you can run to me when your heart feels heavy and lean your head on my shoulder. We had sex once after the break up and I wish you wanted my love more than you lust for sex at the moment? Is that a valid statement to say? Maybe you do want my love but baby I want all of you not just part of you. Please come home and sit still inside me because I would hate to see you come and go. Until you find someone new… I’ll be here… until you find someone new Ill be here. I just wanted to make you know how I feel although it may bug you I’m overthinking. I just wish things were different. I know you may feel different. I love you for it regardless. I love to see you prosper with or without me. It hurts but baby I’m here in the back of the ceremony rooting for you, so happy for you, I know your eyes are fixed on someone new and other things so you don’t notice me and that’s fine, here I am, happy for your accomplishments.

The feeling of new love is so euphoric, I just have to share. We have decided not to put a label on what we have going on, so I don’t consider her my girlfriend by any means. I broke up with an ex of 1 year about a month and a half ago, and since about 4 weeks ago, me and this girl have been talking more than before, and hanging out. I never even thought about flirting or making a move, because I was in the process of getting out of a relationship I felt stuck in. More than anyone else, she helped me understand what was wrong with my relationship and would always give pointers on how to make relationships more successful. I had given up on love. For months before I broke up with my ex, me and this girl talked all the time about love. I explained to her many many times that I’ve lost faith in relationships. My ex of 5 years cheated on me along with physical abuse. My ex after that started acting like my other ex(very violent) and I decided that no one should ever feel threatened by their partner, even if they haven’t taken a swing yet. This girl explained to me that life is about taking chances and dating shouldn’t be ruled out just yet. Always kind of hinting at the thought of us being together. I work as a CNA in a long term care facility and she does the same PRN. We don’t work together much, but everytime we have, it seems like every one of our coworkers seem to think we were together. It’s not just our coworkers, the residents we take care of hint at it and tease us both about dating each other. A week or so after I broke up with my ex, I was on the phone with her. We talked about what went wrong and why I had bad luck with dating before. She kept expressing to not lose hope. The next day we worked together and while we were changing residents/doing vitals etc, she kept sort of bumping into me. She would stand really close when we talked and never took her eye off me. I knew what was happening and I wasn’t about to let my insecurities pass this off. We started talking about taking it super slow in a relationship being the best choice. She mentions she wouldn’t mind doing something like that and I say the same. To hang out, talk all the time, whatever couples do, just not labeling it. We figure that’s the best way to do things, except that we’ve already knew each other for 11 months that I’ve been working with her and have became very good friends. When she brings this up I knew for a fact that she wanted to go out with me, so I asked her if she wanted to come have some drinks and watch some movies at my house. She very quickly agreed and we made a date to hang out. When the time comes, she shows up at my house, like an hour late(she had a good excuse) and we start talking. We put on a movie but not a second of it was watched. We just talked and talked. I knew I couldn’t chicken out and not make a move, and I also knew that with her being very shy, there was no way she was going to make a move. Everytime I got up from the couch to grab another beer or make her a drink, I would sit closer and closer when I got back to the couch. At this point I’ve had 2 or 3 beers and I was starting to feel my intuition slip away. Even if she tells me she doesn’t like me like that, I’ll be able to defend my actions and apologize, so what’s to lose? I had this overwhelming feeling that I misunderstood all of our talks and all the hints, all the things residents and coworkers have said. I felt like she wasn’t comfortable and that I was going to make a big mistake if I were to make a move.  After making her a drink and sitting down right next to her, were our arms are touching, I throw my arm around her and she sinks into me, holding me, like she’s been waiting 11 months for this. I’ve never felt so exhilarated in my life. I figured I’ve got it in the bag, so I lean in to kiss her and she grabs my face and pulls it closer. We ended up making out for quite some time before she had to leave for work in the morning. I felt very very happy about this and high on life. Within a couple days we had already set up another time for us to hang out. I decided we should go on a hike, then back to my house. That was very successful as well and I felt like there was nothing stopping us from continuing this. She’s been on vacation for the last 2 weeks but we plan to go camping next Wednesday and Thursday on an island. We have so much in common and she is absolutely stunning. I can’t mess this up, but I at least know for sure that even if it doesn’t work out, we will still be great friends. Thank you for all that came to listen , have a great day!"},

It's been a while since we last spoke, and I've been doing some reflecting lately & really for a long while now. There are memories we shared together that I still hold dear. I wanted to take a moment to reach out and check in on you. Life has its up and downs, but I often find myself thinking about the times we spent together and the joy it brought me. I know we've both moved on with our lives, but that doesn't diminish the significance of the impact you had on me. I just wanted you to know that I'm grateful for the time we had together even though short lived and the person you helped me become. Not to toot my own horn but I am pretty proud of the person I am today & in one way or another you had part into shaping who I am today. The last time I attempted to rekindle our relationship/friendship, I know it didn’t end well. There were some assumptions that were made and although rightfully so, I never had the chance to explain myself or explain the misunderstanding. It’s been such a long time since so it may be irrelevant today but I wanted to reach out nonetheless. If you ever feel like catching up or grabbing a coffee, I'd love to hear from you. But regardless, I wish you nothing but happiness and fulfillment in all that you do. I pray for you and will continue to pray for your wellbeing & happiness. Graciously, An Old Love"},
{"Title": "I love my boyfriend so much it hurts. He makes me so happy.", "Author": "u/sheerest_of_folly", "Content": "I know not many people will likely care to read my rant, but I love this man so fucking much. We’ve been dating for almost 3 years (anniversary in July). For 2.5 of them, we were online. Online relationships are hard. He’s in South Carolina, I was in Maryland. I decided to move to him. On the way down, on January 31st, literally 40 minutes away, my mom fell asleep at the wheel and we crashed into the moving van (she was going to drop me off, as she herself was moving to Florida with my youngest sibling. Other sibling stayed with Dad in Maryland for college.) I was the only one moderately injured in the wreck (thank God) and was taken to the hospital in an ambulance. I told my boyfriend where. He met me there. I saw my boyfriend in person for the first time while on a hospital bed. The first few months were rough for me to settle in. 21 years in Maryland in the same area my whole life was hard to transition from. My boyfriend was with me every step of the way. March was the anniversary of the deaths of several people who were important to me in my youth. They died in a car crash when I was a young teen. In Maryland, every year I would go to the playground we all played at on their deathiversary, since none of them were buried (all cremated to my knowledge). My boyfriend drove me the 500 miles to go back to Maryland to be at that playground. In April, I had a breast reduction surgery. The recovery for that was rough— for the first two weeks, I couldn’t reach my middle well enough to use the bathroom. This man wiped my pee for me, and once the anesthesia wore off, my poop too. I got my period in the second week. He learned how to put a tampon in me and take it out. He was by my side the whole time. The breast reduction was done in Maryland and we stayed with my father for a week. I’ve only seen my father cry three times: when our cat died, at the end of Star Wars (because “it’s so happy, they got the medals they worked so hard for” 💀), and when my boyfriend and I left. My father said he’s a good man and he’s so happy for us. He also gave him $400 to “pay him back” for medical expenses. My boyfriend ended up using the remainder on a date with me. Speaking of dates. I love notebooks and pens; my boyfriend doesn’t really care about those. Yet he took me on a date to Staples and Michaels, I thought to window shop but he bought so much for me. He also gets me some model skulls that I collect when he sees a cool one. Shortly after I moved in, he came home with one meant for an aquarium: “I thought of you.” I cried. We went to MomoCon this year, and he cosplayed with me. We went as Leon and Ada from the Resident Evil series (specifically the RE4 remake). He waited in line for Digimon and Pokémon voice actors with me and listened to me rant about the characters I like. We’re getting married next year. We aren’t conventionally engaged yet— he has something planned but won’t tell me— but we know we’re getting married. We just haven’t told our families yet. I’m so fucking excited and happy that this is the man I get to spend my life with."},

I never wanted kids but I’ve always said if we was to have a baby I never want to work during my pregnancy and at least the first year of motherhood. He did just that respected my wishes. He took me out of my job provided for me throughout our pregnancy, allowed me to enjoy every aspect of it, attended ALL appointments included the ones that weren’t about the baby but about me. That was the moment for me I knew I was having a baby with the right person. After I gave birth the first 6 weeks he didn’t leave by my side supported my throughout my breastfeeding journey (still doing) he cooked for me making sure I ate, made sure I got enough sleep, would take most nights with our newborn and some days too, made sure I didn’t feel overwhelmed.

I was in a temporary situation with someone and before it started we both agreed it had a countdown because we both would be moving to very different places quite soon and there's little to no chance of crossing paths after. All was understood and glad this was clear and upfront, but after it ended I came to a strange realization. Compared to all flings or real relationships (some more healthy/successful than others) I've had in the past it was the most authentic affection I've received so far. And the most I've wanted to give affection in return. I'm not particularly sad or regretful in any way cause I knew the conditions, but I'm startled that I can confidently say a less than two month fling felt more honest and caring than any previous entanglement had. I don't think it's because it is more fresh in my mind, just to state. I guess I just always felt like I did more or more was always expected from me than was ever given. I guess I'm wondering how it's possible that the most mature and earnest experience of positive emotional expression (non-platonic) I've had so far came from something so simple and short lived ?"},

The tears on your face as we said I love you for the last time are forever imprinted in my memory. You don't know how badly I wanted to wipe them away, kiss your forehead, and promise you it would be okay. I knew I couldn't, because then I would never get out of your car. I've been trying to keep myself busy. Started going to the gym every day instead of every other. It hasn't really helped too much, but it's nice to keep my mind off you for a few hours. I stare at my bare ring finger more often than I should. I still instinctively go to grab my ring off my dresser when I wake up every morning, even though it's not there anymore. Everything makes me think of you. The cicadas chirping makes me think of us laughing when you told me they keep getting caught in your windshield. The news reminds me of our long drives where we would discuss politics and everything going on in the world. Every outfit I put on reminds me of when I would wear it with you. Inside Out 2 comes out in two days! I hope you're as excited as I am. I know we've been planning for months on watching it together on opening night. A part of me wonders if we'll be watching it at the same time at different theatres, laughing and crying at the same parts of it. Honestly, I'm probably just going to cry through this whole thing as I wish you were by my side while I watch. Maybe I'll wait to see it until I feel ready. I hope you still get to see it, though. I can't stop living in the \"what ifs\" of it all. What could have been different, what could have changed. I yearn for you. My heart feels half empty. I know it's unhealthy to live in the past, but the only way I've been able to fall asleep at night is when I replay our old memories in our head. Even then, I wake up in the middle of the night gasping and imagining the past few days have just been some fucked up nightmare. I had to mute your number, because every time my phone buzzed, deep down I hoped it was you. Even still, I find myself constantly looking at the little red numbers above the texting app, hoping it goes up by one. The amount of times I dialed your number just to not hit call is pathetic. I just need to hear your voice. I know this yearning is unhealthy, but I don't know when it will go away. I miss your smile, and the way your nose scrunches when you're really happy. I miss your silky black hair and your mocha skin. I miss your dark brown eyes that I would constantly get lost in. I miss your touch and I miss your kisses. I miss feeling the tightness when you squeeze me when we hug. I miss hearing your heart beat when I rest my head on your chest. I remember the first time I ever did that way back when we first staring dating and I could feel it racing, it made me blush. I miss your gentle voice and your roaring laugh. I miss our deep talks and our petty gossip. I even miss our fights, as dumb as that sounds. I just miss everything. It's been hard to scroll through social media because anytime I see something that reminds me of you, I want to send it to you. I've been sending them to my own number instead. In fact, to be honest, I've been texting my own number a lot. Whenever I want to text you, I just text it to myself. It still cuts like glass when the message immediately bounces back. Anyway, my eyes are getting misty so I'll stop here. Goodbye, my love. Maybe in another life, we'll do things right. I love you infinity plus one, ha I win."},

They're they're own person too. I feel like that would be too much pressure on someone. I don't understand \"romantic expectations\" like sex or how your life goal according to society should be to get in a romantic relationship. I don't understand so much about \"love\" or affection, at least now how society views it, and I want to understand. I have a partner and I care about them very much.

I love sending them gifts, calling them, and doing things together. I love being there for them and comforting them. I'm always proud of them.

We sat down briefly and she showed me how they’d carefully wrapped it in tissue paper for her. As we drove home I just remember her telling me how comfortable it was when she tried it on , how the sales assistant had made her feel positive about it, and how special it made her feel. She told me the same thing a few times but I loved every moment of it. She’d never had a properly fitted bra before and it’s an experience that I think I enjoyed more just listening to how happy it made her 🥹"},

I've gone back and forth on if I should tell this story, but I'm a writer at heart and putting thoughts and emotions to words is how I work through it all, and maybe someone will read this and feel something, also so all the kids out there know that love is never simple, and you are bound to get caught up in it even well into your adult years. So back in January I met lets call her N, and we instantly connected. Like she called me the night after our coffee date to talk more, it was just so comfortable, we texted every day, called few times a week. Within a couple weeks we'd been on three more dates and made things official, after that we spent every weekend either at her place or mine, and occasionally got together during the week too. N and I have a dozen things in common, specific video games, humor, movies, and even our obscure fashion and interior design choices match. We shared personal, private pains. Before two months were up she had told me she loved me, I'd told her I was getting there, I had met her friends more than once, and we both had told our parents about each other. It seemed like a beautiful beginning. But then it ended suddenly. She had a bout of insecurities and she felt like she didn't deserve me, I couldn't convince her I was happy with her, and she ended things. But neither of us wanted the other out of our lives. We continued to talk every day, call each other, and we still regularly got together in person. After more than a month it looked from my side like we could start again, but N had an old long distance friend. This guy had never been too happy we were dating, and had decided now was a good time to come down and see N for the first time in years. I had an opportunity to tell N how I truly felt before he showed up, N and I had gone out drinking the night before he arrived, and though she showed doubt about what she wanted from her old friend, there was wonder too. So rather than throw an emotional bomb at her the night before, I kept my silence. I told her a week later, though I knew she had decided to be with him. I told her, not to confuse or ask anything of her, simply because she deserved to know. Her old insecurities had been wrong, and I still wanted to be a part of her life. She was not happy. Mad that I had taken so long to feel what she had felt months earlier, mad that I hadn't said anything that last night, mad that she thought I was only pretending to be friends, and even still insecure that I could still want someone like her in my life. That was only a month ago, and to this day we talk everyday, call at least once a week, and see each other nearly every week. We are both excited for an upcoming con, a game release later this year, and she expressed wanting to go to renn faire with me still. She is fast becoming my best friend, and I honestly am so happy I met her, I don't regret a thing. I don't know what the future holds, I'm casually looking for another partner, but mainly on bettering myself. We may or may not ever get back together, but I hope that in five years we are still talking every day, and getting together once a week to see each other. Love is beautiful in all forms, even at times in heartbreak and lost potential."},

I’ve been seeing her for almost a year and I’m still anticipating someone popping out with a camera crew to let me know it’s all been a set up, but it never happens. I tried dating apps and asking people out for the better part of a decade not really feeling much of a connection or finding a spark that fizzled out quickly. In the last couple years I realized I was asexual. The general population is less than 1% ace, and of that one percent you’re lucky if you find 1 or 2 people you have something in common with. When I saw her dating profile I was floored. Someone who was more like me than anyone I’d ever seen on any dating app, ace, and incredibly beautiful. We hit it off pretty quickly through text chat and quickly moved to phone calls. We have similar niche hobbies, asthetics, work in the same industry, similar off brand humor, politics, values, and so many more things. She’s hilarious, nerdy, an incredible artist talented beyond her years, jaw dropping beautiful, smart, affectionate and caring. I have so many overwhelming feelings about her and our time together so far, like on our first date when she held my arm as we drunkenly walked the city streets looking at an festival market and playing ski ball together at the arcade, or our second date having a picnic in the botanical gardens, looking at all the Christmas lights in town til dark and doing star gazing. It’s been almost a year of dating and every one we go one seems impossibly magical  putting rom coms to shame. We spend a few evenings each week playing board games online, cracking jokes and telling each other about what’s going on in our lives.

We had mutuals so we would come around each other when our friends had kickbacks etc. I began to pursue him because I thought he was cute and liked him. Eventually he showed me that he reciprocated so we began to date and go out. We would go to sports games out to dinners & he would come over often to swim etc.  we had a real strong connection and all- This all happened so fast, but we were young and in love. even though I wanted him to make me his girlfriend he never did because he didn't know that I wanted that. Eventually I got back with my ex & we decided to stay as \"friends\". Obviously the relationship with my ex didn't work out and we ended up breaking up indefinitely. I continued to live my life, but I couldn't help but not being able to stop thinking about the one that got away. It has been years since we've talked and yet I feel like this- wondering what if?  One night while drinking with my friends I got the balls to reach out to him (the one who got away). I tried to rekindle our relationship and at first he was for it. He was a bit hesitant and still had a wall up which was understandable, but gradually he was letting me in. We decided we were going to take it slow and we were not girlfriend and boyfriend yet, but I was happy and content with how it was going. I was growing as a person in different aspects of my life and wanted him to be apart of it all. Sometime later that month I went hiking with my best friend that I call Main Squeeze, babe, bae all of the above (she’s been my bestie since middle school). We were making it a habit of going hiking every weekend. One Saturday when we went hiking, I posted on Twitter \"going hiking with bae\" & he saw it and immediately unfollowed me and ghosted me. l know from his perspective it seemed wrong, but I was seriously hiking with my best friend. Looking back now obvi that was stupid to do but I was young and dumb. Me being young, dumb and immature, I didn't think to reach out to him and I just let it be. I was being stubborn that he unfollowed me and left it as is. I never got to explain myself or tell him that it was only my best friend I was hiking with. Here I am 8 years later still thinking of him and now he was the one that got away. I keep thinking of where life could've taken us & how happy we could've been. It makes me sad because I want him to see the person that I am today, (grown with an education, car own place etc), I still have things I can work on & those are all materialistic things but I have worked so hard for the person I am today. I’m so proud of the woman I am today and wish he could be apart of this chapter of my life. Maybe a year or two after that incident I reached out to him through text. At that time he was in a relationship so he just responded with \" maybe you shouldn't be texting me lol\" I said OK and left it as is. Fast forward to today they are no longer together, that relationship did not last long and as far as I know he is single. I brought this up to my therapist and she encouraged me to maybe reach out now to just express my feelings and where I'm at right now, to do it now while we're single and not committed to anything. She said that might be easier because time will pass and if I wait for more time for us to be in committed relationships or even married with a family to then even think about reaching out will be difficult. So should I do it? Should I reach out? I don't want to be a bother. I don't want to be a fool or make a fool of myself. Should I just let it be and continue to live my life how l've been? It has been years since we've talked and yet I feel like this wondering what if?"},

I was over that person and I was ready the date. But the funny thing was, I decided to hop on PlayStation with my two friends wanting to play a video game to just pass the time since at the time I was living with my parents and I was waiting to go to work because at the time I didn’t have my license. so we played a game of Fortnite and rocket league and I think we did fall guys. But then I was talking to one of my friends and I said dude this whole. PlayStation list of people on here is very bare meaning I don’t have any person. I only had like my family and a few coworkers on there. And my friends from school when I graduated. I said to my friend I wish there was a way that I can find people and be friends with and just play video games because at the time I was still in a dark place I needed somebody to talk to like my friends didn’t really talk to me about that stuff because sometimes they would get annoyed And would not talk to them about it. So I hopped on Reddit. I had an old account where I went on the sub, but I had to delete it because of stuff happened, which explain another time but I went on there scrolled a few to see if anybody was willing to play a video game. I met one person. they were from the states like I was we didn’t really play any games. We just talked on discord that was really about it. We were talking for about a few weeks and they were likely busy a lot so we didn’t really get much talking to and I didn’t really get to play with them on video games so I was a little bummed out about that so I scrolled again on that sub Reddit to look then I found the post that would change my life like seriously she made a post about wanting to find people to play video games. There was a few people on that. That asked her to play video games. They gave their usernames to her and I was one of the few that gave her mine because I said hey I’m a girl if that matters. After a bit, I hopped on PlayStation and played with my friends, and I got a notification. Saying the infamous line hey are you from Reddit? And I said yes I’m from Reddit. Are you that person that made that post and obviously I was thinking oh my God I’m so stupid. Yes of course that is. We started talking for a bit. She asked me are you from the UK and I said I’m actually from the United States we started talking a little bit and we didn’t play any games at first she actually ghosted me for a bit lol and after that she came back and we started playing a video games together, and she asked me if I had discord and I gave her my username to her so after that, we actually started talking a lot more and we actually had so much in common we played video games and after a while we actually started having feelings for each other when we were talking about this not long ago she said she was the first person to fall in love with me even though I was like wait really I was shocked because I was the first person that fell in love with her so now the rest is history it’s been going on for almost 2 years now me and her together in December. Thank you so much for reading this and I hope you find your person ❤️ also sorry about the grammar. I’m using the voice chat my arms are hurting"},
{"Title": "A little story of how I met the girl I’ve been talking to.", "Author": "u/Zealousideal_Ad321", "Content": "Sorry, this will be long, but very worth the read. The feeling of new love is so euphoric, I just have to share. We have decided not to put a label on what we have going on, so I don’t consider her my girlfriend by any means. I broke up with an ex of 1 year about a month and a half ago, and since about 4 weeks ago, me and this girl have been talking more than before, and hanging out. I never even thought about flirting or making a move, because I was in the process of getting out of a relationship I felt stuck in. More than anyone else, she helped me understand what was wrong with my relationship and would always give pointers on how to make relationships more successful. I had given up on love. For months before I broke up with my ex, me and this girl talked all the time about love. I explained to her many many times that I’ve lost faith in relationships. My ex of 5 years cheated on me along with physical abuse. My ex after that started acting like my other ex(very violent) and I decided that no one should ever feel threatened by their partner, even if they haven’t taken a swing yet. This girl explained to me that life is about taking chances and dating shouldn’t be ruled out just yet. Always kind of hinting at the thought of us being together. I work as a CNA in a long term care facility and she does the same PRN. We don’t work together much, but everytime we have, it seems like every one of our coworkers seem to think we were together. It’s not just our coworkers, the residents we take care of hint at it and tease us both about dating each other. A week or so after I broke up with my ex, I was on the phone with her. We talked about what went wrong and why I had bad luck with dating before. She kept expressing to not lose hope. The next day we worked together and while we were changing residents/doing vitals etc, she kept sort of bumping into me. She would stand really close when we talked and never took her eye off me. I knew what was happening and I wasn’t about to let my insecurities pass this off. We started talking about taking it super slow in a relationship being the best choice. She mentions she wouldn’t mind doing something like that and I say the same. To hang out, talk all the time, whatever couples do, just not labeling it. We figure that’s the best way to do things, except that we’ve already knew each other for 11 months that I’ve been working with her and have became very good friends. When she brings this up I knew for a fact that she wanted to go out with me, so I asked her if she wanted to come have some drinks and watch some movies at my house. She very quickly agreed and we made a date to hang out. When the time comes, she shows up at my house, like an hour late(she had a good excuse) and we start talking. We put on a movie but not a second of it was watched. We just talked and talked. I knew I couldn’t chicken out and not make a move, and I also knew that with her being very shy, there was no way she was going to make a move. Everytime I got up from the couch to grab another beer or make her a drink, I would sit closer and closer when I got back to the couch. At this point I’ve had 2 or 3 beers and I was starting to feel my intuition slip away. Even if she tells me she doesn’t like me like that, I’ll be able to defend my actions and apologize, so what’s to lose? I had this overwhelming feeling that I misunderstood all of our talks and all the hints, all the things residents and coworkers have said. I felt like she wasn’t comfortable and that I was going to make a big mistake if I were to make a move.  After making her a drink and sitting down right next to her, were our arms are touching, I throw my arm around her and she sinks into me, holding me, like she’s been waiting 11 months for this. I’ve never felt so exhilarated in my life. I figured I’ve got it in the bag, so I lean in to kiss her and she grabs my face and pulls it closer. We ended up making out for quite some time before she had to leave for work in the morning. I felt very very happy about this and high on life. Within a couple days we had already set up another time for us to hang out. I decided we should go on a hike, then back to my house. That was very successful as well and I felt like there was nothing stopping us from continuing this. She’s been on vacation for the last 2 weeks but we plan to go camping next Wednesday and Thursday on an island. We have so much in common and she is absolutely stunning. I can’t mess this up, but I at least know for sure that even if it doesn’t work out, we will still be great friends. Thank you for all that came to listen , have a great day!"},

It's been a while since we last spoke, and I've been doing some reflecting lately & really for a long while now. There are memories we shared together that I still hold dear. I wanted to take a moment to reach out and check in on you. Life has its up and downs, but I often find myself thinking about the times we spent together and the joy it brought me. I know we've both moved on with our lives, but that doesn't diminish the significance of the impact you had on me. I just wanted you to know that I'm grateful for the time we had together even though short lived and the person you helped me become. Not to toot my own horn but I am pretty proud of the person I am today & in one way or another you had part into shaping who I am today. The last time I attempted to rekindle our relationship/friendship, I know it didn’t end well. There were some assumptions that were made and although rightfully so, I never had the chance to explain myself or explain the misunderstanding.

The tears on your face as we said I love you for the last time are forever imprinted in my memory. You don't know how badly I wanted to wipe them away, kiss your forehead, and promise you it would be okay. I knew I couldn't, because then I would never get out of your car. I've been trying to keep myself busy. Started going to the gym every day instead of every other. It hasn't really helped too much, but it's nice to keep my mind off you for a few hours. I stare at my bare ring finger more often than I should. I still instinctively go to grab my ring off my dresser when I wake up every morning, even though it's not there anymore. Everything makes me think of you. The cicadas chirping makes me think of us laughing when you told me they keep getting caught in your windshield. The news reminds me of our long drives where we would discuss politics and everything going on in the world. Every outfit I put on reminds me of when I would wear it with you. Inside Out 2 comes out in two days! I hope you're as excited as I am. I know we've been planning for months on watching it together on opening night. A part of me wonders if we'll be watching it at the same time at different theatres, laughing and crying at the same parts of it. Honestly, I'm probably just going to cry through this whole thing as I wish you were by my side while I watch. Maybe I'll wait to see it until I feel ready. I hope you still get to see it, though. I can't stop living in the \"what ifs\" of it all. What could have been different, what could have changed. I yearn for you. My heart feels half empty. I know it's unhealthy to live in the past, but the only way I've been able to fall asleep at night is when I replay our old memories in our head. Even then, I wake up in the middle of the night gasping and imagining the past few days have just been some fucked up nightmare. I had to mute your number, because every time my phone buzzed, deep down I hoped it was you. Even still, I find myself constantly looking at the little red numbers above the texting app, hoping it goes up by one. The amount of times I dialed your number just to not hit call is pathetic. I just need to hear your voice. I know this yearning is unhealthy, but I don't know when it will go away. I miss your smile, and the way your nose scrunches when you're really happy. I miss your silky black hair and your mocha skin. I miss your dark brown eyes that I would constantly get lost in. I miss your touch and I miss your kisses. I miss feeling the tightness when you squeeze me when we hug. I miss hearing your heart beat when I rest my head on your chest. I remember the first time I ever did that way back when we first staring dating and I could feel it racing, it made me blush. I miss your gentle voice and your roaring laugh. I miss our deep talks and our petty gossip. I even miss our fights, as dumb as that sounds. I just miss everything. It's been hard to scroll through social media because anytime I see something that reminds me of you, I want to send it to you. I've been sending them to my own number instead. In fact, to be honest, I've been texting my own number a lot. Whenever I want to text you, I just text it to myself. It still cuts like glass when the message immediately bounces back. Anyway, my eyes are getting misty so I'll stop here. Goodbye, my love. Maybe in another life, we'll do things right. I love you infinity plus one, ha I win."},

I came back and waited outside the shop for her once it’d been about 25 minutes. She came out with the bra packaged inside a cord-handled bag. She was beaming with excitement. We sat down briefly and she showed me how they’d carefully wrapped it in tissue paper for her. As we drove home I just remember her telling me how comfortable it was when she tried it on , how the sales assistant had made her feel positive about it, and how special it made her feel. She told me the same thing a few times but I loved every moment of it. She’d never had a properly fitted bra before and it’s an experience that I think I enjoyed more just listening to how happy it made her 🥹"},

I was in a temporary situation with someone and before it started we both agreed it had a countdown because we both would be moving to very different places quite soon and there's little to no chance of crossing paths after. All was understood and glad this was clear and upfront, but after it ended I came to a strange realization. Compared to all flings or real relationships (some more healthy/successful than others) I've had in the past it was the most authentic affection I've received so far. And the most I've wanted to give affection in return. I'm not particularly sad or regretful in any way cause I knew the conditions, but I'm startled that I can confidently say a less than two month fling felt more honest and caring than any previous entanglement had. I don't think it's because it is more fresh in my mind, just to state. I guess I just always felt like I did more or more was always expected from me than was ever given. I guess I'm wondering how it's possible that the most mature and earnest experience of positive emotional expression (non-platonic) I've had so far came from something so simple and short lived ?"},

I've gone back and forth on if I should tell this story, but I'm a writer at heart and putting thoughts and emotions to words is how I work through it all, and maybe someone will read this and feel something, also so all the kids out there know that love is never simple, and you are bound to get caught up in it even well into your adult years. So back in January I met lets call her N, and we instantly connected. Like she called me the night after our coffee date to talk more, it was just so comfortable, we texted every day, called few times a week. Within a couple weeks we'd been on three more dates and made things official, after that we spent every weekend either at her place or mine, and occasionally got together during the week too. N and I have a dozen things in common, specific video games, humor, movies, and even our obscure fashion and interior design choices match. We shared personal, private pains. Before two months were up she had told me she loved me, I'd told her I was getting there, I had met her friends more than once, and we both had told our parents about each other. It seemed like a beautiful beginning. But then it ended suddenly. She had a bout of insecurities and she felt like she didn't deserve me, I couldn't convince her I was happy with her, and she ended things. But neither of us wanted the other out of our lives. We continued to talk every day, call each other, and we still regularly got together in person. After more than a month it looked from my side like we could start again, but N had an old long distance friend. This guy had never been too happy we were dating, and had decided now was a good time to come down and see N for the first time in years. I had an opportunity to tell N how I truly felt before he showed up, N and I had gone out drinking the night before he arrived, and though she showed doubt about what she wanted from her old friend, there was wonder too. So rather than throw an emotional bomb at her the night before, I kept my silence. I told her a week later, though I knew she had decided to be with him. I told her, not to confuse or ask anything of her, simply because she deserved to know. Her old insecurities had been wrong, and I still wanted to be a part of her life. She was not happy. Mad that I had taken so long to feel what she had felt months earlier, mad that I hadn't said anything that last night, mad that she thought I was only pretending to be friends, and even still insecure that I could still want someone like her in my life. That was only a month ago, and to this day we talk everyday, call at least once a week, and see each other nearly every week. We are both excited for an upcoming con, a game release later this year, and she expressed wanting to go to renn faire with me still. She is fast becoming my best friend, and I honestly am so happy I met her, I don't regret a thing. I don't know what the future holds, I'm casually looking for another partner, but mainly on bettering myself. We may or may not ever get back together, but I hope that in five years we are still talking every day, and getting together once a week to see each other.

We have similar niche hobbies, asthetics, work in the same industry, similar off brand humor, politics, values, and so many more things. She’s hilarious, nerdy, an incredible artist talented beyond her years, jaw dropping beautiful, smart, affectionate and caring. I have so many overwhelming feelings about her and our time together so far, like on our first date when she held my arm as we drunkenly walked the city streets looking at an festival market and playing ski ball together at the arcade, or our second date having a picnic in the botanical gardens, looking at all the Christmas lights in town til dark and doing star gazing. It’s been almost a year of dating and every one we go one seems impossibly magical  putting rom coms to shame. We spend a few evenings each week playing board games online, cracking jokes and telling each other about what’s going on in our lives. It’s been like finding a new best friend who I can also cuddle and shower with admiration. I’m mostly writing this because I can’t see her immediately and need to vent all this loving energy somewhere. I can’t wait til I get to see her again, sharing time with her just makes that time so much brighter!"},

We are incompatible and yet we liked spending time together. He loves me but I am still finding my understanding of love in him. I don’t find peace. I feel hurt and misunderstood. We’ve been tumultuous for long and I think now, I don’t have it in me to resist a breakup more. I feel no emotion but a very heavy heart. Almost as if I am tired to feel the sadness. I feel like I might distance myself from people. I am sure he feels lonely now, we are miles away. He is not home but travelling and I hope he is alright. I wish him a good life.

{"Title": "To rekindle, or not to rekindle that is the question *lengthy*", "Author": "u/Traditional-Wait-827", "Content": "So there is a boy M (26?) and me F (28) that met about 8 years ago. We had mutuals so we would come around each other when our friends had kickbacks etc. I began to pursue him because I thought he was cute and liked him. Eventually he showed me that he reciprocated so we began to date and go out. We would go to sports games out to dinners & he would come over often to swim etc.  we had a real strong connection and all- This all happened so fast, but we were young and in love. even though I wanted him to make me his girlfriend he never did because he didn't know that I wanted that. Eventually I got back with my ex & we decided to stay as \"friends\". Obviously the relationship with my ex didn't work out and we ended up breaking up indefinitely. I continued to live my life, but I couldn't help but not being able to stop thinking about the one that got away. It has been years since we've talked and yet I feel like this- wondering what if?  One night while drinking with my friends I got the balls to reach out to him (the one who got away). I tried to rekindle our relationship and at first he was for it. He was a bit hesitant and still had a wall up which was understandable, but gradually he was letting me in. We decided we were going to take it slow and we were not girlfriend and boyfriend yet, but I was happy and content with how it was going. I was growing as a person in different aspects of my life and wanted him to be apart of it all. Sometime later that month I went hiking with my best friend that I call Main Squeeze, babe, bae all of the above (she’s been my bestie since middle school). We were making it a habit of going hiking every weekend. One Saturday when we went hiking, I posted on Twitter \"going hiking with bae\" & he saw it and immediately unfollowed me and ghosted me. l know from his perspective it seemed wrong, but I was seriously hiking with my best friend. Looking back now obvi that was stupid to do but I was young and dumb. Me being young, dumb and immature, I didn't think to reach out to him and I just let it be. I was being stubborn that he unfollowed me and left it as is. I never got to explain myself or tell him that it was only my best friend I was hiking with. Here I am 8 years later still thinking of him and now he was the one that got away. I keep thinking of where life could've taken us & how happy we could've been. It makes me sad because I want him to see the person that I am today, (grown with an education, car own place etc), I still have things I can work on & those are all materialistic things but I have worked so hard for the person I am today. I’m so proud of the woman I am today and wish he could be apart of this chapter of my life. Maybe a year or two after that incident I reached out to him through text. At that time he was in a relationship so he just responded with \" maybe you shouldn't be texting me lol\" I said OK and left it as is. Fast forward to today they are no longer together, that relationship did not last long and as far as I know he is single. I brought this up to my therapist and she encouraged me to maybe reach out now to just express my feelings and where I'm at right now, to do it now while we're single and not committed to anything. She said that might be easier because time will pass and if I wait for more time for us to be in committed relationships or even married with a family to then even think about reaching out will be difficult. So should I do it? Should I reach out? I don't want to be a bother. I don't want to be a fool or make a fool of myself. Should I just let it be and continue to live my life how l've been? It has been years since we've talked and yet I feel like this wondering what if?"},

We have the best sex together, she doesn’t bother giving me head for hours even tho I don’t ask her. I’m so opened to her emotionally and she never took use of that. She protects me so much I feel like this is not even real. She shows how much she wants to see me and actually does stuff to achieve that. She introduced me to her parents and friends too.

I'm 27F and never been in love before, so I've no baseline for how it's supposed to feel. I tried researching it and one of the most common answers was \"you just know\" followed by \"if you have to ask, you're not\" but I'm not sure that'll be true for me as I'm a bit disconnected from my emotions. For instance, with my friends, they're great people, I love being around them and I want the best for them, but do I love them? I don't know. I can confidently say I love my best friend, but that's because I've known her 13 years. And I never had a \"wow, I love this girl\" revelation with her either. I only knew years down the line when I realised we'd built something permanent and substantial and we knew each other inside and out. It's the same with my family - I know I love them because they've been in my life for so long. I can't picture life without them. So I'd say love to me = familiarity and comfort. Is romantic love different? Less about the practicalities? I just don't understand. I like this guy a lot. I'm attracted to him physically but also emotionally. I'm a very shy person, I struggle with social anxiety, but when I'm with him I never worry about being judged or saying the wrong thing. I just feel completely at ease, like I can totally be myself. I've never been around him and thought \"man, I wish this would end.\" We always have fun together. I care about him and want to impress him, he's the first thing on my mind in the mornings and the last thing on my mind at night. Is this what love is supposed to be? I've never looked at him and had a magical revelation. I don't know if it'll last. But I know I want to keep showing up for him, and I hope he wants that too."},

I was over that person and I was ready the date. But the funny thing was, I decided to hop on PlayStation with my two friends wanting to play a video game to just pass the time since at the time I was living with my parents and I was waiting to go to work because at the time I didn’t have my license. so we played a game of Fortnite and rocket league and I think we did fall guys. But then I was talking to one of my friends and I said dude this whole. PlayStation list of people on here is very bare meaning I don’t have any person. I only had like my family and a few coworkers on there. And my friends from school when I graduated. I said to my friend I wish there was a way that I can find people and be friends with and just play video games because at the time I was still in a dark place I needed somebody to talk to like my friends didn’t really talk to me about that stuff because sometimes they would get annoyed And would not talk to them about it. So I hopped on Reddit. I had an old account where I went on the sub, but I had to delete it because of stuff happened, which explain another time but I went on there scrolled a few to see if anybody was willing to play a video game. I met one person. they were from the states like I was we didn’t really play any games. We just talked on discord that was really about it. We were talking for about a few weeks and they were likely busy a lot so we didn’t really get much talking to and I didn’t really get to play with them on video games so I was a little bummed out about that so I scrolled again on that sub Reddit to look then I found the post that would change my life like seriously she made a post about wanting to find people to play video games. There was a few people on that. That asked her to play video games. They gave their usernames to her and I was one of the few that gave her mine because I said hey I’m a girl if that matters. After a bit, I hopped on PlayStation and played with my friends, and I got a notification. Saying the infamous line hey are you from Reddit? And I said yes I’m from Reddit. Are you that person that made that post and obviously I was thinking oh my God I’m so stupid. Yes of course that is. We started talking for a bit. She asked me are you from the UK and I said I’m actually from the United States we started talking a little bit and we didn’t play any games at first she actually ghosted me for a bit lol and after that she came back and we started playing a video games together, and she asked me if I had discord and I gave her my username to her so after that, we actually started talking a lot more and we actually had so much in common we played video games and after a while we actually started having feelings for each other when we were talking about this not long ago she said she was the first person to fall in love with me even though I was like wait really I was shocked because I was the first person that fell in love with her so now the rest is history it’s been going on for almost 2 years now me and her together in December. Thank you so much for reading this and I hope you find your person ❤️ also sorry about the grammar. I’m using the voice chat my arms are hurting"},
{"Title": "I think I handled this situation with my girlfriend well, but I’d like to be sure", "Author": "u/MichiganWinterBear", "Content": "So I have a question/story just trying to gauge if I handled this situation appropriately and carefully and thoughtfully. My girlfriend and I have been going through my out for 2 1/2-3 months or so, and yesterday she told me she thinks she loves me. I knew ahead of time I wasn’t going to say it until we were further into the relationship as I’ve gotten out of a 13 year marriage and want to be careful because she’s my first relationship post divorce. I do feel those feelings, I want to spend every day with her and when she leaves I’m very sad. The thing that’s made this relationship feel different is I am a different man than the one who was married for 13 years. It was a high school sweetheart relationship and we both had our failings but for my part I wasn’t emotionally mature enough to be the husband and loving partner I needed to be. I’ve made those changes with my new girlfriend and it’s been appreciated and shown. She makes me know I have changed into who I’ve wanted to be and appreciates when I’m trying in a way my ex just didn’t. We’ve also gone through some emotionally heavy times with my divorce obviously looming over our relationship and the grieving process for me that entails as well as her having lost her father this past week after a years long fight with cancer. I have been there for her in the way I always knew I could but never did with my ex wife. I’ve been supportive, I met her father on his deathbed, drove up the day after to support her. And we were lying in bed and she let out all of her emotions over his passing (she’d been handling it weirdly well in the days after until that moment). I held her while she cried as much as she needed and then she said she wanted to say something but was nervous. I had a feeling I knew what she was going to say but I tried to give her the space to because it felt like she really wanted to. And then she said it. “I think I love you” It made me flutter, it felt like every effort I’ve made on myself to be a better man to be a better partner were recognized by someone I enjoy so much and can see a future with. I responded with what I felt was the most heartfelt way while explaining where I was at. “I’m getting closer every day.” It’s an accurate description that I am getting to that point to say it back, that I’m building an emotional connection, I just can’t say it this close to when my marriage dissolved. But also I want her to know it’s not that I won’t be or that I’m emotionally unavailable. And to her absolute credit she said she didn’t need to hear it back, just that she needed to say it because she’s felt it since the day after I met her father. So I just want to be certain I handled this right, that I responded in the right way to say exactly how I feel: I will be there someday soon just not yet."},

He made sure we video call much as he can, we played games and watch YouTube together most nights. 10 months later he asked me to go to a $b concert. He already had a ticket but since the show was sold out he was looking around for one from around town for mine . I got the time off and flew over. He waited at the gate with some flowers for me. But he wasn’t able to get another ticket, so he sold his ticket. Even though  he was so excited and the reason he asked me to come fell through he wasn’t t upset, he was just happy I was there we just blasted it at home instead. my medication alerts changed because of the time difference and he woke up at 5am every morning to help me take my meds, I didn’t even ask. He had a month off work so he took me somewhere new every day. I met his whole family and they welcomed me immediately. And his friends are my friends now too! His mom picked me up when he was he went back to work, so I wasn’t home alone during the day all week. His mom told me she’s  never seen him this happy🥹 I have bpd, and I was still struggling when we first met.

I feel like that this is more of a wedding vow or an engagement line, that requires at least a committed year together with all the highs and lows. The thing is, and this is something that I've observed, is that when a man is genuinely committed to their partner, he will move mountains, he will part seas for them, he will bring the sky down, if that's what it takes. People sing for love, live for love, kill for love, and die for love. And that's so true. You will literally start wars and make peace for love. I don't know, I probably should start actually dating someone. It's just hard being vulnerable, and it's really not something that I need to worry about right now, because of my other priorities. It would be nice, to be with someone. But I don't want to be with someone just to be with someone, I want it to be because I'm truly, madly, deeply, completely in love with them. That is the way. And my more Mandalorian side is showing now. Because they have to be your cyare . It's actually a little funny because, at least for me, love is deep, ocean deep to the hadosphere. It can be as beautiful as a sunfish, or as monstrous as an anglerfish. It depends on the day, and it depends on the people involved, and of course, the reciprocity. There's one thing I've learned though, you should never sacrifice your self-respect. That if somebody genuinely loves you, they will value your self-respect and your agency too much to allow you to burn it. Went from a question to an early morning philosophy rant. Sorry about that and have a great weekend."},

I 21f had been dating a guy for about 3 months until he ghosted me on Wednesday after I let him know I was upset that he left me on delivered all day bc he slept in till 7pm when we had made plans to see one another. I respectfully let him know that it upset me, I understand he works a lot, and in the future I just ask that he would just give me a heads up if he was too tired to meet, so I could anticipate that we won’t meet. Instead of leaving me on delivered for 19 hours on a day we planned to hang out. I thought I was being as respectful and communicative as possible, but he hasn’t talked to me since. I even sent a follow up text yesterday night saying “hey did I say something that bothered you? If I did, that was not my intention and I just wanted to let you know how I felt in that moment. Do you want to talk?” I know it’s over since he hasn’t talked to me since and we have talked everyday since we first met, but also that it’s probably not healthy to be in a relationship with someone that can’t communicate anyway. I do feel really upset and sad because he was the first person I ever went on a date with and my first kiss. Any advice on how to heal from being hurt and basically ghosted? It just feels like I can’t recover from this or I don’t know how. Thank you"},

I remember the first time I saw him I thought he was so attractive, everyone else who knew him was so excited to see him so he seemed very friendly and personable. Fast-forward to where we are at now and I could have never imagined my life turning out like it is now. I stay with him about 90% of the time and every time I look at him I want to physically cry from how happy I am. I can't remember the last time I have felt this genuinely happy. I recently went through a bad concussion that affected my blood pressure (weird, I know) and I could barely even walk ten feet without nearly passing out which meant I couldn't work out like I'm use to and that was super hard for me. I spent so much time crying from stress/pain and all that and he never left my side if he didn't have to. He was overly caring and I had never felt so loved in my life. His parents were even calling to check in on me and I had never felt like a partner's parents had cared so much. Everytime I look at my bf I am amazed at how lucky I got to be with him. I love watching him play his video games and seeing him so happy. His laugh is the best sound to me and he always hold me so tightly. I love going with him to run little errands because I love being able to be seen with him in public. He will always give me butterflies and I have never felt my heart so full for someone.

I was in a temporary situation with someone and before it started we both agreed it had a countdown because we both would be moving to very different places quite soon and there's little to no chance of crossing paths after. All was understood and glad this was clear and upfront, but after it ended I came to a strange realization. Compared to all flings or real relationships (some more healthy/successful than others) I've had in the past it was the most authentic affection I've received so far. And the most I've wanted to give affection in return. I'm not particularly sad or regretful in any way cause I knew the conditions, but I'm startled that I can confidently say a less than two month fling felt more honest and caring than any previous entanglement had. I don't think it's because it is more fresh in my mind, just to state. I guess I just always felt like I did more or more was always expected from me than was ever given. I guess I'm wondering how it's possible that the most mature and earnest experience of positive emotional expression (non-platonic) I've had so far came from something so simple and short lived ?"},

{"Title": "One week since we went no contact, a letter I wish I could send", "Author": "u/slenderfingerz", "Content": "My sweet boy, Not a minute goes past where you don't cross my mind. The tears on your face as we said I love you for the last time are forever imprinted in my memory. You don't know how badly I wanted to wipe them away, kiss your forehead, and promise you it would be okay. I knew I couldn't, because then I would never get out of your car. I've been trying to keep myself busy. Started going to the gym every day instead of every other. It hasn't really helped too much, but it's nice to keep my mind off you for a few hours. I stare at my bare ring finger more often than I should. I still instinctively go to grab my ring off my dresser when I wake up every morning, even though it's not there anymore. Everything makes me think of you. The cicadas chirping makes me think of us laughing when you told me they keep getting caught in your windshield. The news reminds me of our long drives where we would discuss politics and everything going on in the world. Every outfit I put on reminds me of when I would wear it with you. Inside Out 2 comes out in two days! I hope you're as excited as I am. I know we've been planning for months on watching it together on opening night. A part of me wonders if we'll be watching it at the same time at different theatres, laughing and crying at the same parts of it. Honestly, I'm probably just going to cry through this whole thing as I wish you were by my side while I watch. Maybe I'll wait to see it until I feel ready. I hope you still get to see it, though. I can't stop living in the \"what ifs\" of it all. What could have been different, what could have changed. I yearn for you. My heart feels half empty. I know it's unhealthy to live in the past, but the only way I've been able to fall asleep at night is when I replay our old memories in our head. Even then, I wake up in the middle of the night gasping and imagining the past few days have just been some fucked up nightmare. I had to mute your number, because every time my phone buzzed, deep down I hoped it was you. Even still, I find myself constantly looking at the little red numbers above the texting app, hoping it goes up by one. The amount of times I dialed your number just to not hit call is pathetic. I just need to hear your voice. I know this yearning is unhealthy, but I don't know when it will go away. I miss your smile, and the way your nose scrunches when you're really happy. I miss your silky black hair and your mocha skin. I miss your dark brown eyes that I would constantly get lost in. I miss your touch and I miss your kisses. I miss feeling the tightness when you squeeze me when we hug. I miss hearing your heart beat when I rest my head on your chest. I remember the first time I ever did that way back when we first staring dating and I could feel it racing, it made me blush. I miss your gentle voice and your roaring laugh. I miss our deep talks and our petty gossip. I even miss our fights, as dumb as that sounds. I just miss everything. It's been hard to scroll through social media because anytime I see something that reminds me of you, I want to send it to you. I've been sending them to my own number instead. In fact, to be honest, I've been texting my own number a lot. Whenever I want to text you, I just text it to myself. It still cuts like glass when the message immediately bounces back. Anyway, my eyes are getting misty so I'll stop here. Goodbye, my love. Maybe in another life, we'll do things right. I love you infinity plus one, ha I win."},

My girlfriend and I have been together for a little over 6 months and have known each other for a year.

I used the Black Widow trailer and near the end, it cuts to me with a photo collage of us together and advertising our two-night event. The first night was okay, the internet made the video quality of our video call grainy and it kept cutting in and out. Even with that, I sent her the mixtape I made her (with songs that we both shared) and she loved it! Okay, moving on to the big event. Yesterday was our big event and after discussing our relationship and how far we've come, she told me she had a surprise for me at 11:59pm. Woah. I told her I did too (maybe a mistake on my part because she was expecting something, DARN IT!!!) and we danced, watched a movie and played games to pass the time. So, at 12:01am, after freshening up in the bathroom we got to the bathroom. I got back to the phone and after a little pause, she says \"I kinda, sorta, am 100% in love with you.\" She sent me her beautiful gift and I was happy! Then, I asked if it was my turn to share with her and she said yes. I prepared a four page speech (which was going to actually be a letter, but I just decided to read it to her). In the letter, it was very personal and heartfelt. I told her I love her. She, teary-eyed, paused and said...\"I love you too.\" I cried, we all cried. It was sooooo beautiful. She then said \"I knew since February.\" *sobs* We spent the rest of the night talking about the ways we were planning on saying it. Then we went to sleep at the same time, we didn't hang up and we woke up and continued the conversation. I will never forget this special moment. Thank you so much, V. I love you so much!

We sat down briefly and she showed me how they’d carefully wrapped it in tissue paper for her. As we drove home I just remember her telling me how comfortable it was when she tried it on , how the sales assistant had made her feel positive about it, and how special it made her feel.

Within a couple weeks we'd been on three more dates and made things official, after that we spent every weekend either at her place or mine, and occasionally got together during the week too. N and I have a dozen things in common, specific video games, humor, movies, and even our obscure fashion and interior design choices match. We shared personal, private pains.

We continued to talk every day, call each other, and we still regularly got together in person. After more than a month it looked from my side like we could start again, but N had an old long distance friend. This guy had never been too happy we were dating, and had decided now was a good time to come down and see N for the first time in years. I had an opportunity to tell N how I truly felt before he showed up, N and I had gone out drinking the night before he arrived, and though she showed doubt about what she wanted from her old friend, there was wonder too. So rather than throw an emotional bomb at her the night before, I kept my silence. I told her a week later, though I knew she had decided to be with him. I told her, not to confuse or ask anything of her, simply because she deserved to know. Her old insecurities had been wrong, and I still wanted to be a part of her life. She was not happy. Mad that I had taken so long to feel what she had felt months earlier, mad that I hadn't said anything that last night, mad that she thought I was only pretending to be friends, and even still insecure that I could still want someone like her in my life. That was only a month ago, and to this day we talk everyday, call at least once a week, and see each other nearly every week. We are both excited for an upcoming con, a game release later this year, and she expressed wanting to go to renn faire with me still. She is fast becoming my best friend, and I honestly am so happy I met her, I don't regret a thing. I don't know what the future holds, I'm casually looking for another partner, but mainly on bettering myself. We may or may not ever get back together, but I hope that in five years we are still talking every day, and getting together once a week to see each other. Love is beautiful in all forms, even at times in heartbreak and lost potential."},

I feel so connected to him, and I love him with my entire being. He's my person. The one I want to do everything with, the first person I tell about anything. The person I turn to for comfort, for laughter. I love exploring our city together just as much as I love exploring new places together. I love the small things just as much as I love the big things. His smile makes my heart melt and I've never been more interested in what anyone has to say than when he's talking about something he's passionate about. I feel so safe in his presence and I sleep better with him than I ever have. We've been talking about getting married for the past couple months and he's confirmed that he plans on getting me an engagement ring soon, and with our anniversary coming up at the end of the month I feel like it'll be around then. Plus, I saw him looking up rings. And I'm so excited. Whether he does it now or later, I'm just happy to know I'll be spending the rest of my life with him. I don't care about a big wedding or anything like that. I just can't wait to call him my husband, and to hear him call me his wife. Love, in all forms, is what makes life truly worth living. Connection, and shared experiences. Self love. The love of being a parent, or being a child. Closeness with your family, or building your own chosen family. Friendships, marriages, and pets. This is what it's about. And I'm eternally grateful to be filled with an infinite amount of love, and especially grateful to feel it back. ❤️"},

{"Title": "I’m thinking of ending my marriage of nearly two decades", "Author": "Unknown author", "Content": "I met the love of my life, knew I was going to marry her from the moment I saw her. Fought for her and married her less than a year later. My life was complete. I was the happiest guy on earth. This lasted for 10 years where I knew we had the kind of bond you see in movies. Nothing could ever tear us apart. It was us against the world. Then we decided to start a family. Immediately after she gave birth her whole demeanour towards me changed overnight. Gone were the constant moments of affection, the closeness we had on a daily basis, the sex, everything. I put it down to hormonal changes as giving birth is a big ordeal after all, and I gave her time. Lots of time. When after 3 years nothing changed, I sat her down and told her how I felt and how she made me feel. Like I was a stranger in my own house. Like I was living with a room mate who were only acquaintances with no romantic ties, hell without a proper friendship. I was expecting her to say she didn’t feel the same about me anymore, but to my surprise she said she hadn’t noticed!! She said she would try harder, and that was that. Nothing changed and we continued our surreal coexistence where nothing made sense to me. I suggested we see a marriage councillor to try and help. At first she agreed, but when d-day arrived she refused to take part. Fast forward another 3 years and I’m at my wits end. Unconditional love has turned into resentment. Joyful moments throughout the day where we exchanged a kiss or a touch or even a look has turned into a depressing nightmare for me where I feel utterly rejected and useless as a husband. I feel like the only reason I’m still needed is when I have to do things for her. Like fix her car, or build her some furniture or run errands. I don’t get anything in return that makes it feel worthwhile to be married to her anymore. I don’t ask for much. All I want is my wife back, to feel wanted and loved. But I’m getting nothing. At this point the resentment has grown so much that I don’t think I could trust it even if she magically decided to treat me like she used to. So here I am contemplating ending our marriage. Not because there’s someone else. I don’t know if I could ever trust anyone else. All I know is I will be happier on my own because I won’t be reminded every day of what my life used to be like. The only thing stopping me is our daughter. She is the light of my life and I would rather be unhappy so she doesn’t have to be. She loves us both equally and she knows something is up because she is forever trying to bring us closer together, even though she’s only 6. People say it’s better for kids if break up with your partner than be in a toxic relationship around them. And I agree. The only thing is we are perfectly pleasant towards one another. We never fight or scream and shout. My wife seems perfectly happy with the current arrangement as she is always on a high. And I would be over the moon for her, but not at my expense and my happiness. I’m thinking I should give this a final chance and say to her I’m about to end it unless she agrees to some councilling, to see if this marriage can be saved. Other than that I don’t see what other options I have but to walk out of this marriage. Love was always enough for me. It was my only requirement, and without it I have no reason to stay. If anyone has any insight or went through something similar I would be grateful for a bit of guidance as it scares the shit out of me."},

I’ve been seeing her for almost a year and I’m still anticipating someone popping out with a camera crew to let me know it’s all been a set up, but it never happens. I tried dating apps and asking people out for the better part of a decade not really feeling much of a connection or finding a spark that fizzled out quickly. In the last couple years I realized I was asexual. The general population is less than 1% ace, and of that one percent you’re lucky if you find 1 or 2 people you have something in common with. When I saw her dating profile I was floored. Someone who was more like me than anyone I’d ever seen on any dating app, ace, and incredibly beautiful. We hit it off pretty quickly through text chat and quickly moved to phone calls. We have similar niche hobbies, asthetics, work in the same industry, similar off brand humor, politics, values, and so many more things. She’s hilarious, nerdy, an incredible artist talented beyond her years, jaw dropping beautiful, smart, affectionate and caring. I have so many overwhelming feelings about her and our time together so far, like on our first date when she held my arm as we drunkenly walked the city streets looking at an festival market and playing ski ball together at the arcade, or our second date having a picnic in the botanical gardens, looking at all the Christmas lights in town til dark and doing star gazing. It’s been almost a year of dating and every one we go one seems impossibly magical  putting rom coms to shame. We spend a few evenings each week playing board games online, cracking jokes and telling each other about what’s going on in our lives. It’s been like finding a new best friend who I can also cuddle and shower with admiration. I’m mostly writing this because I can’t see her immediately and need to vent all this loving energy somewhere. I can’t wait til I get to see her again, sharing time with her just makes that time so much brighter!"},

{"Title": "To rekindle, or not to rekindle that is the question *lengthy*", "Author": "u/Traditional-Wait-827", "Content": "So there is a boy M (26?) and me F (28) that met about 8 years ago. We had mutuals so we would come around each other when our friends had kickbacks etc. I began to pursue him because I thought he was cute and liked him. Eventually he showed me that he reciprocated so we began to date and go out. We would go to sports games out to dinners & he would come over often to swim etc.  we had a real strong connection and all- This all happened so fast, but we were young and in love. even though I wanted him to make me his girlfriend he never did because he didn't know that I wanted that. Eventually I got back with my ex & we decided to stay as \"friends\". Obviously the relationship with my ex didn't work out and we ended up breaking up indefinitely. I continued to live my life, but I couldn't help but not being able to stop thinking about the one that got away. It has been years since we've talked and yet I feel like this- wondering what if?  One night while drinking with my friends I got the balls to reach out to him (the one who got away). I tried to rekindle our relationship and at first he was for it. He was a bit hesitant and still had a wall up which was understandable, but gradually he was letting me in. We decided we were going to take it slow and we were not girlfriend and boyfriend yet, but I was happy and content with how it was going. I was growing as a person in different aspects of my life and wanted him to be apart of it all. Sometime later that month I went hiking with my best friend that I call Main Squeeze, babe, bae all of the above (she’s been my bestie since middle school). We were making it a habit of going hiking every weekend. One Saturday when we went hiking, I posted on Twitter \"going hiking with bae\" & he saw it and immediately unfollowed me and ghosted me. l know from his perspective it seemed wrong, but I was seriously hiking with my best friend. Looking back now obvi that was stupid to do but I was young and dumb. Me being young, dumb and immature, I didn't think to reach out to him and I just let it be. I was being stubborn that he unfollowed me and left it as is. I never got to explain myself or tell him that it was only my best friend I was hiking with. Here I am 8 years later still thinking of him and now he was the one that got away. I keep thinking of where life could've taken us & how happy we could've been. It makes me sad because I want him to see the person that I am today, (grown with an education, car own place etc), I still have things I can work on & those are all materialistic things but I have worked so hard for the person I am today. I’m so proud of the woman I am today and wish he could be apart of this chapter of my life. Maybe a year or two after that incident I reached out to him through text. At that time he was in a relationship so he just responded with \" maybe you shouldn't be texting me lol\" I said OK and left it as is. Fast forward to today they are no longer together, that relationship did not last long and as far as I know he is single. I brought this up to my therapist and she encouraged me to maybe reach out now to just express my feelings and where I'm at right now, to do it now while we're single and not committed to anything. She said that might be easier because time will pass and if I wait for more time for us to be in committed relationships or even married with a family to then even think about reaching out will be difficult. So should I do it? Should I reach out? I don't want to be a bother. I don't want to be a fool or make a fool of myself. Should I just let it be and continue to live my life how l've been? It has been years since we've talked and yet I feel like this wondering what if?"},

I, having the bad luck I normally do, was seated in the very back row on a small express plane. My boyfriend was seated very close to the front. We decided that we’d try to move but if not then it wouldn’t be a big deal since our flight was a little under 3 hours. I had settled in and so did he so it was safe to assume I’d be stuck next to an already snoring old man. My boyfriend was seated next to a very sociable New Yorker and they were getting along quite well. Just before take of the man seated next to my boyfriend came walking down the aisle repeating “Number 14C! Number 14C! It’s your lucky day, you get to go seat by your man”  I started to laugh and thanked him then moved up to join my boyfriend. During the majority of the plane ride we listened to music together and I slept on his shoulder. I noticed a few times (especially during landing and the process of exiting the plane) this older woman seated near us staring at us for long periods of time. It kind of got excessive and I was tempted to ask her if she was ok or something... We finally get off the plane and I head towards the closest bathroom. I’m washing my hands and at the sink right next to me is that same lady. She then tells me “you’re boyfriend is so sweet to you.. he really is so very sweet to you..” she had tears in her eyes while she spoke. “I haven’t seen that kind of love in so long... my husband passed away one year ago today so I just felt like I needed to tell you. I know I don’t really know you guys but if eyes could speak you two look at each other the same way I did with my husband and we were married over 41 years. He’s a keeper, don’t let him go. It’s hard to find someone who looks at you the way he does and says the things he said to get you to seat next to him on the plane. It was truly beautiful...” I still have no clue what my boyfriend said to get the guy to switch seats with me but honestly what that woman shared with me made my heart grow 100 times."},

I was over that person and I was ready the date. But the funny thing was, I decided to hop on PlayStation with my two friends wanting to play a video game to just pass the time since at the time I was living with my parents and I was waiting to go to work because at the time I didn’t have my license. so we played a game of Fortnite and rocket league and I think we did fall guys. But then I was talking to one of my friends and I said dude this whole. PlayStation list of people on here is very bare meaning I don’t have any person. I only had like my family and a few coworkers on there. And my friends from school when I graduated. I said to my friend I wish there was a way that I can find people and be friends with and just play video games because at the time I was still in a dark place I needed somebody to talk to like my friends didn’t really talk to me about that stuff because sometimes they would get annoyed And would not talk to them about it. So I hopped on Reddit. I had an old account where I went on the sub, but I had to delete it because of stuff happened, which explain another time but I went on there scrolled a few to see if anybody was willing to play a video game. I met one person. they were from the states like I was we didn’t really play any games. We just talked on discord that was really about it. We were talking for about a few weeks and they were likely busy a lot so we didn’t really get much talking to and I didn’t really get to play with them on video games so I was a little bummed out about that so I scrolled again on that sub Reddit to look then I found the post that would change my life like seriously she made a post about wanting to find people to play video games. There was a few people on that. That asked her to play video games. They gave their usernames to her and I was one of the few that gave her mine because I said hey I’m a girl if that matters. After a bit, I hopped on PlayStation and played with my friends, and I got a notification. Saying the infamous line hey are you from Reddit? And I said yes I’m from Reddit. Are you that person that made that post and obviously I was thinking oh my God I’m so stupid. Yes of course that is. We started talking for a bit. She asked me are you from the UK and I said I’m actually from the United States we started talking a little bit and we didn’t play any games at first she actually ghosted me for a bit lol and after that she came back and we started playing a video games together, and she asked me if I had discord and I gave her my username to her so after that, we actually started talking a lot more and we actually had so much in common we played video games and after a while we actually started having feelings for each other when we were talking about this not long ago she said she was the first person to fall in love with me even though I was like wait really I was shocked because I was the first person that fell in love with her so now the rest is history it’s been going on for almost 2 years now me and her together in December.

Last night over the phone I was telling him that once I’m properly making money (I’m still in the process of getting licensed as a lawyer) that I would like to gift my dad some flying lessons, because that’s always been a dream of his. In response, my boyfriend said “That’s awesome, that definitely seems like something we could do for him”. I know some people might not think much of it, but the fact that he included himself in this and said it was something “we” could do for my dad just makes my heart melt. He’s the sweetest man I’ve ever met. I really don’t know what I did to deserve him."},

I’m not just talking about putting a blanket over her. No, she likes it when I fully encase her entire body, including her face, in multiple layers of blankets. She’ll curl up into a little ball and bury herself in my chest. I think it’s the most adorable thing in the world. She just lays in a giant cocoon of blankets while I hold her and kiss her and she loves every minute of it. She won’t speak or move, she just softly breathes as I hold her. Sometimes I make jokes about her being my little burrito, and I’ll hear a muffled giggle come from the blanket. I always knew my girlfriend was cute, but this is a whole other level of cuteness. It started because one day she was cold so I put the blanket around her. She loved it so much that it became our regular thing. It’s like our quirky little thing that bonds us even closer."},

Was staring at me too the entire time with the cutest look on his face ever. Keep in mind this man’s favorite genre is sludge metal so what he did was really probably not his favorite thing to do.

He began to listen to harry styles just so that he could sing with me -he gets very childish everytime he pet a cat. He always has a large smile and he is extremely happy -similar to harry styles, i began reading one piece because i know its his favorite manga. When he learned that i was reading one piece, he was so happy. Sometimes when i read one piece he likes to take me in his arms and read with me. -one time we were going to the gym together. My bf is short and skinny, so i wasnt expecting him to be lifting so heavy lol. When i saw him doing a squat lifting twice my weight, i swear i would have teared his clothes if no one was there. -when he drives. I dont think i need to explain this one. -he has asthma. When he takes his ventoline, i find it extremely sexy (i know its weird) -sometimes he just take my hand and kiss it without reason. -more serious here. He previously had eating disorders and body dysmorphia, due to being bullied in high school. He makes lot of effort to overcome it. He accept now when we do cheat meals bc he know it makes me happy. He is seeing a therapist. I teach him how to be confident, and he puts the work in. This is something very important and sweet to him, and incredibly cute and sexy too -one night he protected me against a drunk guy that was a bit too touchy despite me not wanting.

I couldn't ask for anybody more perfect for me than him honestly. I never really got the whole 'whatever souls are made of, his and mine are the same' thing, but now I really think I do.

They cheated, they called me names for being upset that they were cheating, basically anything but physical abuse for toxic and unhealthy relationships. I thought I knew what love was, but it turns out I only found out what love isn't. My current boyfriend buys me flowers regularly, he buys me stuffed animals, he takes me on dates, we communicate about our issues, he listens to me, we've had many nights where we just turn on the record player and dance in our living room. He makes me feel loved and seen in a way that I never have before. I don't want this magic to end. I've never loved someone the way I love him. I appreciate him so much. Don't give up hope.

My bf, who works from home, took it upon himself to reorder my rx, pick it up, and pick me up some flowers, chocolates, a card, etc. When he returned, I was lying in bed when he brought in all my goodies. I’m assuming he thought I was asleep when I heard him say, “I love you, Peanut (his nickname for me).

{"Title": "I accidently discovered my boyfriend's secret reddit account, and it only made me love him harder.", "Author": "Unknown author", "Content": "My boyfriend (21M) and me (21F) really value privacy in our relationship. We both have reddit accounts where we go to fool around, post memes, ask questions, and vent, but we've agreed not to share it with each other because we both have private thoughts on it. As a sort of pre-cursor to the story, it is important to note that my boyfriend struggles with being emotional, and prefers to be optimistic and overly positive and reassure me that he's fine, that nothing is wrong, that he can handle it, that he's not bothered. I've never believed him but I've never challenged it either. Today, my boyfriend mentioned he posted on reddit for the first time. He said that it was a \"career-related post\", and that he was proud because his post had \"almost 700 upvotes and over 100 comments\". I asked him what it was about, and he said \"my experience with my internship\". I jokingly prodded further and he laughed and refused to elaborate, saying I would find his account easily if he did. I dropped the topic and forgot about it. On a side note, we are both in very similar careers. About an hour ago, I went to a certain subreddit that I frequent to look for posts relevant to my field of research, when I came across a post of someone talking about their experience in this field. Interested, I clicked on the post. As I read it, I felt a nagging sense of familiarity, like someone I knew had written it, but I dropped that thought because I felt it was unlikely. The post went in great detail discussing this person's struggles with their grades, how they never felt like enough, how they thought they would never get hired, and yet how they broke through and got the job. They discussed their growing passion for teaching (which is the reason they made the post, they elaborated) and how they feel fulfilled when they give back. The post was a journey riddled with struggle and doubt and stress, but also brimming with success and passion and charity. I was very touched by it. When I reached the bottom of the post, I glanced at the post stats: Almost 700 upvotes. Over 100 comments. I realized then that I was reading about my boyfriend's struggle, a struggle that he'd kept hidden from me! He'd convinced me at the time of his applying to jobs that he wasn't stressed at all and that he was confident he'd get the job, no matter how much I tried to tell him it was okay if he felt stressed. He would tell me his grades were great and he didn't care about them anyways, and he would tell me his interviews went fine and that he wasn't going to waste time worrying about them. His post, though, told a different story. He had very low grades and never thought he would get hired. All of his friends got hired before him. He was shaking so hard in one interview that he felt the interviewers could see him shake. And yet, he got a job, and a well-paying one at that. He talked about his fears and his passions. He shared his story so others could benefit. He learned through this that he loves to be a teacher. Honestly, I want to cry. He is so beautiful. I didn't know he struggled like this, and my heart is just overflowing with so much pride and joy and happiness for his successes. He's honest and a hardworker, and his willingless to give back to the community in the hopes that he can help another struggling student land a job is just...amazing. Of course, I will never tell him I read it, and I chose not to click on his profile, but it's changed my perspective on him and though I didn't think it was possible, I love him even more now. I love him so much!"},

We have the best sex together, she doesn’t bother giving me head for hours even tho I don’t ask her. I’m so opened to her emotionally and she never took use of that. She protects me so much I feel like this is not even real. She shows how much she wants to see me and actually does stuff to achieve that. She introduced me to her parents and friends too.

I'm 27F and never been in love before, so I've no baseline for how it's supposed to feel. I tried researching it and one of the most common answers was \"you just know\" followed by \"if you have to ask, you're not\" but I'm not sure that'll be true for me as I'm a bit disconnected from my emotions. For instance, with my friends, they're great people, I love being around them and I want the best for them, but do I love them? I don't know. I can confidently say I love my best friend, but that's because I've known her 13 years. And I never had a \"wow, I love this girl\" revelation with her either. I only knew years down the line when I realised we'd built something permanent and substantial and we knew each other inside and out. It's the same with my family - I know I love them because they've been in my life for so long. I can't picture life without them. So I'd say love to me = familiarity and comfort. Is romantic love different? Less about the practicalities? I just don't understand. I like this guy a lot. I'm attracted to him physically but also emotionally. I'm a very shy person, I struggle with social anxiety, but when I'm with him I never worry about being judged or saying the wrong thing. I just feel completely at ease, like I can totally be myself. I've never been around him and thought \"man, I wish this would end.\" We always have fun together. I care about him and want to impress him, he's the first thing on my mind in the mornings and the last thing on my mind at night. Is this what love is supposed to be? I've never looked at him and had a magical revelation. I don't know if it'll last. But I know I want to keep showing up for him, and I hope he wants that too."},

I was over that person and I was ready the date. But the funny thing was, I decided to hop on PlayStation with my two friends wanting to play a video game to just pass the time since at the time I was living with my parents and I was waiting to go to work because at the time I didn’t have my license. so we played a game of Fortnite and rocket league and I think we did fall guys. But then I was talking to one of my friends and I said dude this whole. PlayStation list of people on here is very bare meaning I don’t have any person. I only had like my family and a few coworkers on there. And my friends from school when I graduated. I said to my friend I wish there was a way that I can find people and be friends with and just play video games because at the time I was still in a dark place I needed somebody to talk to like my friends didn’t really talk to me about that stuff because sometimes they would get annoyed And would not talk to them about it. So I hopped on Reddit. I had an old account where I went on the sub, but I had to delete it because of stuff happened, which explain another time but I went on there scrolled a few to see if anybody was willing to play a video game. I met one person. they were from the states like I was we didn’t really play any games. We just talked on discord that was really about it. We were talking for about a few weeks and they were likely busy a lot so we didn’t really get much talking to and I didn’t really get to play with them on video games so I was a little bummed out about that so I scrolled again on that sub Reddit to look then I found the post that would change my life like seriously she made a post about wanting to find people to play video games. There was a few people on that. That asked her to play video games. They gave their usernames to her and I was one of the few that gave her mine because I said hey I’m a girl if that matters. After a bit, I hopped on PlayStation and played with my friends, and I got a notification. Saying the infamous line hey are you from Reddit? And I said yes I’m from Reddit. Are you that person that made that post and obviously I was thinking oh my God I’m so stupid. Yes of course that is. We started talking for a bit. She asked me are you from the UK and I said I’m actually from the United States we started talking a little bit and we didn’t play any games at first she actually ghosted me for a bit lol and after that she came back and we started playing a video games together, and she asked me if I had discord and I gave her my username to her so after that, we actually started talking a lot more and we actually had so much in common we played video games and after a while we actually started having feelings for each other when we were talking about this not long ago she said she was the first person to fall in love with me even though I was like wait really I was shocked because I was the first person that fell in love with her so now the rest is history it’s been going on for almost 2 years now me and her together in December.

{"Title": "I think I handled this situation with my girlfriend well, but I’d like to be sure", "Author": "u/MichiganWinterBear", "Content": "So I have a question/story just trying to gauge if I handled this situation appropriately and carefully and thoughtfully. My girlfriend and I have been going through my out for 2 1/2-3 months or so, and yesterday she told me she thinks she loves me. I knew ahead of time I wasn’t going to say it until we were further into the relationship as I’ve gotten out of a 13 year marriage and want to be careful because she’s my first relationship post divorce. I do feel those feelings, I want to spend every day with her and when she leaves I’m very sad. The thing that’s made this relationship feel different is I am a different man than the one who was married for 13 years. It was a high school sweetheart relationship and we both had our failings but for my part I wasn’t emotionally mature enough to be the husband and loving partner I needed to be. I’ve made those changes with my new girlfriend and it’s been appreciated and shown. She makes me know I have changed into who I’ve wanted to be and appreciates when I’m trying in a way my ex just didn’t. We’ve also gone through some emotionally heavy times with my divorce obviously looming over our relationship and the grieving process for me that entails as well as her having lost her father this past week after a years long fight with cancer. I have been there for her in the way I always knew I could but never did with my ex wife. I’ve been supportive, I met her father on his deathbed, drove up the day after to support her. And we were lying in bed and she let out all of her emotions over his passing (she’d been handling it weirdly well in the days after until that moment). I held her while she cried as much as she needed and then she said she wanted to say something but was nervous. I had a feeling I knew what she was going to say but I tried to give her the space to because it felt like she really wanted to. And then she said it. “I think I love you” It made me flutter, it felt like every effort I’ve made on myself to be a better man to be a better partner were recognized by someone I enjoy so much and can see a future with. I responded with what I felt was the most heartfelt way while explaining where I was at. “I’m getting closer every day.” It’s an accurate description that I am getting to that point to say it back, that I’m building an emotional connection, I just can’t say it this close to when my marriage dissolved. But also I want her to know it’s not that I won’t be or that I’m emotionally unavailable. And to her absolute credit she said she didn’t need to hear it back, just that she needed to say it because she’s felt it since the day after I met her father. So I just want to be certain I handled this right, that I responded in the right way to say exactly how I feel: I will be there someday soon just not yet."},

He made sure we video call much as he can, we played games and watch YouTube together most nights. 10 months later he asked me to go to a $b concert. He already had a ticket but since the show was sold out he was looking around for one from around town for mine . I got the time off and flew over. He waited at the gate with some flowers for me. But he wasn’t able to get another ticket, so he sold his ticket. Even though  he was so excited and the reason he asked me to come fell through he wasn’t t upset, he was just happy I was there we just blasted it at home instead. my medication alerts changed because of the time difference and he woke up at 5am every morning to help me take my meds, I didn’t even ask. He had a month off work so he took me somewhere new every day. I met his whole family and they welcomed me immediately. And his friends are my friends now too! His mom picked me up when he was he went back to work, so I wasn’t home alone during the day all week. His mom told me she’s  never seen him this happy🥹 I have bpd, and I was still struggling when we first met. He’s always been there for me the good and the bad,  he is supportive and understanding and reassured me when I needed it, with his love and support I was able to get into a healthier mindset,with  that and therapy I was able to be in remission for my bpd. Recently we got married and I’ll be moving really soon! His family  checks up on me often while I’m back in America for the time being and helping me with the moving international process. Without his mom I’d be so lost! My husband is truly my better half 🖤"},

I feel like that this is more of a wedding vow or an engagement line, that requires at least a committed year together with all the highs and lows. The thing is, and this is something that I've observed, is that when a man is genuinely committed to their partner, he will move mountains, he will part seas for them, he will bring the sky down, if that's what it takes. People sing for love, live for love, kill for love, and die for love. And that's so true. You will literally start wars and make peace for love. I don't know, I probably should start actually dating someone. It's just hard being vulnerable, and it's really not something that I need to worry about right now, because of my other priorities. It would be nice, to be with someone. But I don't want to be with someone just to be with someone, I want it to be because I'm truly, madly, deeply, completely in love with them. That is the way. And my more Mandalorian side is showing now. Because they have to be your cyare . It's actually a little funny because, at least for me, love is deep, ocean deep to the hadosphere. It can be as beautiful as a sunfish, or as monstrous as an anglerfish. It depends on the day, and it depends on the people involved, and of course, the reciprocity. There's one thing I've learned though, you should never sacrifice your self-respect. That if somebody genuinely loves you, they will value your self-respect and your agency too much to allow you to burn it. Went from a question to an early morning philosophy rant. Sorry about that and have a great weekend."},

Instead of leaving me on delivered for 19 hours on a day we planned to hang out. I thought I was being as respectful and communicative as possible, but he hasn’t talked to me since. I even sent a follow up text yesterday night saying “hey did I say something that bothered you? If I did, that was not my intention and I just wanted to let you know how I felt in that moment. Do you want to talk?” I know it’s over since he hasn’t talked to me since and we have talked everyday since we first met, but also that it’s probably not healthy to be in a relationship with someone that can’t communicate anyway.

{"Title": "does anyone have positive stories of a right person, wrong time situation?", "Author": "u/throwawaybreakup___", "Content": "Before I start, I know so many people say that right person wrong time isn’t a thing because the right person would never find a wrong time to be with you. In general I have always struggled to understand this saying as well until I was in this situation and I do believe in this circumstance, that we are really in the wrong time (could we have made it work? Yes, but I think the way we are handling it will set us up better for anything in the future) To try to keep it short: my ex (28M) and I (26F) met in college and I knew immediately he was who I wanted to be with, he was cute, funny, kind, absolutely lit up every room he was in and he just genuinely made me so happy - fast forward to now (6.5 years later), we had been dating that whole time and went straight from college, to our first apartment, to buying a house and adopting 2 dogs but never spent any part of adult life alone. We both came into the relationship with a bit of a hole left from past relationships that we both filled for eachother but it left us with a major codependency issue that neither of us really noticed until now. Also since we bought our house 4 years ago, it basically was falling apart and needed expensive repairs often, we both had issues with work and very opposite schedules, and basically everything in our lives wasn’t working except our relationship but even that was strained by all of these outside factors. He recently came to me and said he thinks he needs some time on his own to work on himself because he has been feeling depressed and that he doesn’t like himself or really know who he is as an individual and that he felt like I was the only thing making him happy and helping him through everything and it worked for a long time but he needed to be able to work on all of this stuff for himself alone. This was a blindside for me because he didn’t communicate any of this to me earlier (an issue he said he regrets and needs to work on in therapy) but I just want him to be happy and healthy and I want him to have the time to heal those things, and I also have realized my codependency I’ve developed through all of the shit we went through too. TLDR: it’s hard to sum up almost 7 years in a “short” post so a lot of context is missing but I tried my best - do you have a story of where you broke up and got back together or had a right person wrong time situation and it worked out? We both love eachother so much still and don’t want to not be together but literally everything was rooting against us and the time apart is happening no matter what now. I really think that it could be the thing we need to come back together stronger as individuals but I’m trying not to hold on too tight because although we left the door open, we both said not to wait and just experience whatever life wants to have happen. you’re free to comment whatever but I would really like to see only positive stories on this here, I have seen a million negative ones already and have heard that I’m dumb for thinking this could work so that’s why I’m seeking positive stories here to see if it’s possible"},
{"Title": "My best friends mean the absolute whole world to me", "Author": "u/gemmadaniel", "Content": "My (19f) closest friends (19f, 19f, 19nb) have been with me for a long time. I’ve known one since kindergarten and the other two since 6th grade. We’ve all remained pretty close and have taken some hard hits together. In middle school, each year we had different ‘friends’ that caused problems, mainly the impacts of their mental health affecting us. Then the other person who was in our group moved halfway across the country and then after a year or so, they stopped talking to us. In high school, we had a normal first semester of freshman year, then the pandemic hit. We went back sophomore year with all the masks, bleaching desks after each class, plexiglass dividers at lunch tables, you know the works. But on November 11th, I became paralyzed by a benign spinal tumor. The back pain I had leading up to it was excruciating, evidently it was a little tumor the size of the tip of my pinky finger destroying my spine from within. It completely destroyed my T2 vertebra, resulting in a full corpectomy, damaging T1-T4. I am a T4 incomplete paraplegic. This means I have no voluntary movement but some sensation. I can feel pressure and pain, but not temperature. I spent 2 months in the hospital (complications) and 2 months in rehab, all during the pandemic. This included turning 16 in quarantine as a staff member tested positive for covid. As a birthday gift, my friends got me a build a bear raccoon named Raccoon Reacts, an inside joke. Before the paralysis, I had a group of friends i’ve been referring to as ‘the guys’ since I was the only girl (no romantic feelings, they were like brothers to me.) I met them freshman year through shared classes and we’d discord call almost daily. Those calls helped me get through the hospital and rehab. My first outing after paralysis was a movie with them. I’d invite them over to hang out. I went back to school that fall, junior year. My counselor was able to make my lunch time the same as theirs so i’d have friends to sit with. After lunch, they’d come with me in the elevator, even if their class wasn’t upstairs. Throughout junior year, I started to notice that I stopped getting invited to things. I don’t know if they thought it would hurt more to be invited but not able to go due to inaccessibility of people’s houses, but I would’ve preferred being invited anyway, that would mean they wanted me there, even if I couldn’t be. Speaking to a mutual, he said he noticed it too but didn’t say anything since we weren’t that close. Senior year, they stopped responding to messages. I would see them in the halls and would wave or smile at them and some would do the same. One of them kept his eyes forward. I’m not hard to miss and he was tall. I still have all of their birthdays on my calendar. I lost my ex best friend and ex boyfriend the same month, ending friendship after a fight and getting dumped. I felt so alone for so long. But my best friends helped pick up the pieces, offering support and love. We hadn’t been talking a ton when the problems w the guys happened, but one day I reached out, missing them, and it was like we never lost contact. It was back to sending memes to each other, talking about our day, etc. They’ve been so supportive when things have gone wrong for me, and I’ve been supportive the same. Now that we’re on summer break for some (I graduated with a one year diploma in pharmacy technician at a community college), it’s just working around work schedules to hang out. We’ve gone to the zoo, saw movies, now we’re planning a puppy play date with our dogs. They’ve been with me since day one and I don’t know what I would do without them. They’ve shown me true friendship, unlike the guys."},

It doesn't make sense, I could tell you about so many conversations where I was truly moved by how supportive he was and not a single one where anything I said backfired - there were a couple where he showed less of a reaction than I would have liked, but that's about it. He's also very open with me, our precedent of asking each other for emotional support when we're having a bad day was almost entirely established by him. I firmly believe that more honesty is the solution, and my first instinct would be to make use of that principle right away and just tell him about this struggle, but the struggle itself is the reason I can't just do that.

Because I, caught up in some ego-driven moment and taking her for granted, thought it was a good idea to suddenly unload all my issues with her that I had built up until then: the fact that I had to become cold when I perceived coldness from her, the fact that I felt guilty every time I told her I didn't feel like going out, and so on... Well, we resolved things and got back together, and I deeply regretted trying to leave her: so much so that from that point on I started being more affectionate than ever, with the intention of never letting something like that happen again. Then yesterday, she complained that I wasn’t listening to her anymore, that she wanted to feel more understood and I, laughing (Oh, how stupid I was, my God) told her, “then leave me.” From there followed a series of messages where basically she and I realized there were fundamental problems in our relationship, with lifestyles that were too different and differences that were often only resolved by further conflicts. The fact is, I practically pushed the narrative of the breakup; she absolutely didn’t have it in mind. Or rather, she didn’t have it in mind but when the conversation actually started, she agreed. Let's say it was 60% on my part and 40% on hers. Well, a day after the breakup, I feel more devastated than ever - sure, I’ve been through breakups before but NEVER with so many emotions involved - and I don’t know if this decision was the right one. The problem is that it's too late to try to fix things and, again, the dice has been cast. You might think “Well? What are you waiting for, go get her back!” ...I know that even if we tried to force things and get back together, as much as we love each other, we would find other reasons to fight and it wouldn’t be the same as before. And it’s all my fault. I’m being eaten alive by loneliness, nostalgia, and regret. What do you suggest? Thanks in advance :’) TL;DR: my girlfriend and I broke up but I'm not sure it was the right thing to do"},
{"Title": "Genuine question on longterm relationship,marraige and the idea of individual growth and change", "Author": "u/ApprehensiveBug1141", "Content": "For the longest time, ive felt that long term relationships can never be happy. Like i usually would view couples had been together for like 2 years and then gotten married, as happier than like couples who have been together for say, 5 to 8 years. I just always felt they werent really in love or happy and we probably bored of each other with no spark. I dont know why ive felt this way, and i would like to address it in therapy. Ive also heard that, when it comes to long term relationships, people experience a lot of growth and change, in terms of things like life goals, ambition, values, needs etc, and then they become incompatible, and fall out of love at times, then break up. But with marraige, ive noticed people tend to not really say this. Ive felt that change is really inevitable, and if you get into a relationship with someone and youre together for over say, 5 to 9 years, and you both change, similarly a couple who have been together for a long term that started out as compatible will also change. I just feel like, don't we all change in the end? form our 20s to 30s to our 40s, it just feels like we are never done forming and exploring new parts of ourselves, it seems everyone says exploring and changing takes place only in our 20s, but for some does it ever stop, really? Can incompatibility mean that when those changes occur and no compromise can be reached, then its better you both end things. It seems people bring up that sex in long term relationships gets boring or unexciting too. But does that also happen with marraige as well? im looking to get perspectives from everyone, and hope i can learn something new today"},

Love and romance is often a tragedy met with hardship because the world isn't designed for it. People that just want to live in peace, be with their loved ones, put some good out into the world. We're kind of easy targets. So when I think of the people I love I also feel fear. What will this horrible world do to a family just trying to carve out their own small nook of comfort. They want us broken and corrupted. Oh my family can have nice things if I'm a cutthroat opportunist to the point that I lose myself, great. I've seen individuals actively trying to ruin the livelihood of others for the pettiest reasons. And for what, to feel like the favorite special little helper? Forget integrity, I can pretend to be friends with self serving monsters. I'm posting this in r/love because I want to make it clear that I am very much in love, and have been for 19 years. I also know the profound happiness and sadness of being a father. It's easy to write about beautiful memories and experiences, or gush over romantic prospects and honeymoon periods. I just know the world has no interest in letting it be. And I don't want that for my daughter. So while I find myself being unable to sell my soul to the devil and kiss the boots of some power tripping snake that wants to gloat over arbitary titles, I still want to make enough money so that she can have more choices. Perhaps even the ability to live in peace. And I want her to still have her mom and dad with their morals intact. It isn't reality, nobody said life was fair, it could be so much worse, be grateful for what you do have, yada yada. We tell ourselves what we have to, we believe what we have to. But I just want to believe what I know is true. I love my wife and my daughter beyond all the poignant and passionate displays of art and poetry in the world. I am also willing to grind myself to the nub for them, but I can't pretend that it's not fucked up that a family that wishes for nothing but to follow the rules and take care of each other quietly without an ounce of hate simply cannot be if they say we can't. Everyone that wants to live humbly with kindness in their hearts should have that option; the same way evil, organized or not, can live out their fantasies, often at the expense of people like us."},

I can’t help but wonder as I go out my day how you are going about yours. I can’t get the image of you crying while we said goodbye out of my head. All I wanted to do was wipe your tears, run my fingers through your hair, and tell you it’s okay and that I’m here but I couldn’t because that’s a lie. It’s not okay, and I’m not here. I mean, I know it WILL be okay, but it’s hard to imagine that right now. Everything reminds me of you. I stare into your dark brown eyes as I look into my cup of coffee, I hear your laugh in the back of my mind when I see something funny I would’ve showed you, I look down at the indentation left on my ring finger and remember the day you slid the promise ring onto it as I cried tears of joy. I wish I told you I was proud of you more often. I know I’ve told you that before, but I didn’t tell you it as much as I should have. You’ve been working so hard, I wish I could give you one last backrub while I commend you after a long day. I haven’t been sleeping well. I wake up in the middle of the night calling for you before remembering there is no “you” in my life anymore. For the past two days I’ve woken up and grabbed my phone to text; “Baby, I just had the worst nightmare” just for there to be no heart emoji or contact picture attached to your name anymore. I know things had to end, we couldn’t keep running from it, and we couldn’t just go on both feeling unhappy in this relationship and pretending everything is fine. I know that. I just wish there was some alternate universe where we wanted to same things and were going down the same path and things aligned the way they should have. After two years of your name sending dopamine to my brain the second it entered my ears, I never thought the same name would bring tears to my eyes and make my heart sink. I think about the time we joked about Pavlov as I realize there truly is a conditioned response attached to your name. I hate that I can’t talk to you. I know it’s the only way we can both heal, but it’s hard to start my day off without a “Good morning, my love.” There is so much more I have to say, but I guess I’ll have to wrap things up. I love you with all my heart, and I always will."},

I kindly ask you advice upon this matter. In almost my entire life I fell in love only once. Butterflies in the stomach, hypothetical bedtime stories and dreams about a girl. I was too young first in my consciousness and then in everything else. While I was given multiple chances nothing happened (I regretted it later). From then until the age of 18 on the eve of the upcoming Panhellenic exams (in which I started to understood what real anxiety means) I never fell in love even when I had some relationships with women in between. Through my friends I met a girl whom I never paid much attention to throughout the school years. She was a girl sweeter than sugar, with senile prudence and playfulness, with a gentleness befitting a grown woman and a sweetness befitting elementary school children (I cannot describe it perfectly in my second language). Usually when I talked to her it would be few words (I was embarrassed to even curse or say something weird like I did with my friends in front of a person like her). Exams started and discussions at school increased with her day by day. Today after Latin exams due to lack of sleep I collapsed on my mattress and slept for hours. Until at some point a dream began to stimulate all my senses and the brain put spotlights on it. I felt something soft in my hand. A woman's hand caressing mine. Silky smooth and velvety, I swear I can still feel the sensation. I could swear it was her own hand, the same colors, the same voice, the same attitude. It was so beautiful, so unique, so strange. I woke up calm (which doesn't happen often these past few days) and covered in sweat. My heart was beating my chest. My eyes opened wide and my hands started shaking. I don't feel love for this person, I never saw her romantically...Until now probably. But I have never held anyone's hand with such intense love as I held hers in my dream.I can't forget it, it was so uniquely intense. I don't know what to think and what to do. I have one more lesson left (history) to finish the exams and if there is this so called summer of \"release\" before joining the university (if the grades agree) I don't know if I should make a move or not. For the first time I feel that am afraid to talk to her and for the first time I feel that I am afraid of rejection by her, something that I never really cared about before. I feel alone, I'm shaking all over and I would love absolutely any advice."},

I (19F) have dated twice already since I've been in school so far. The first story I want to tell is of the first guy(19M) I dated for about 7 months. I had gotten dressed one morning and I didn't think it was raining that hard. I hurried to the Cafe to meet my boyfriend (at the time) and once I got there he asked if I had a Textbook that was needed for my first class of the day. I realized I didn't have it so I ran back to my dorm and back with the book and I was so tired so I just sat down. And for whatever reason, I didn't have my umbrella with me that day. He went to the restroom and came back with paper towels and I didn't think much of it until he knelt down in front of me and used the paper towels to wipe my legs, arms, and glasses from the rain (mind you I was wearing shorts and a short sleeve shirt). I didn't ask him to do this and all I cared about when going through the rain was making sure the Textbook didn't get messed up. It was one of those moments that makes him a rare person to find in life. We both ended things mutually after a while and we're still friends and I wish him luck on finding someone. The next story is about the second guy(18M) I dated. We dated for about a few weeks and then things didn't end up working out cause neither of us were ready, bur we're still friends. Me and him would watch shows together in the evening after we did all our schoolwork. We would watch animes and cartoons, etc. Often times when we hung out he'd put his arm around me and we'd cuddle and hug. My glasses always ended up sliding and it'd be a hassle to push them up so I used his arm (the one that was around me) to push up my glasses instead. I didn't realize he took note of this and every few minutes he would push up my glasses for me so I could see better. This is a moment that also makes him a rare person to find with his traits and behaviors. All I'm saying is, don't go searching for this because it will find you. If any of these traits or types of people find you, be lucky and don't let them go."},

For some reason, I have a visceral reaction to other people’s pains/negative experiences. On Christmas Eve of 2022, my old friend tragically passed away in a car accident. He had just turned 30 and been married only 2 months before he died. In the summer of 2023, my good friend from high school got a divorce from his wife. In fall of 2023, my long time neighbor got divorced from his wife. Around Christmas of 2023, I read a story about a man who was truly in love with his wife for many years but She left him to pursue a career in adult films. All of these stories have left me feeling jaded and numb to the idea of “true love”. I think about these situations often and although they didn’t happen to me directly, they do cause me discomfort and stress. I have never been a relationship or had sex. I think maybe that’s why I am also thinking about these things a lot? I think I am just afraid to be in a relationship because I am so terrified it’s going to end. Whether by death or divorce or some other circumstance. I’m scared of being heartbroken but at the same time I’m tired of being lonely all the time. I wish I had a wife I could love and spend time with. I just can’t get out of this negative feedback loop in my head. Any tips or advice for me? TL;DR a series of unfortunate events has led me to believe that “true love” is nonexistent and I have developed an extremely cynical/pessimistic view of romantic relationships between a man and a woman.

{"Title": "Had a few bad dates and I need help keeping hope alive.", "Author": "u/VeterinarianJumpy688", "Content": "So I (22m) had my first relationship last year with a girl (21f) we met at work and lasted 4 and a half months. After she left the job roughly around the 2 month mark in our relationship things started going downhill, she wasn’t putting as much effort in, and then her mental health got worse and we broke up in mid January this year. (You can see my post history for more details). Since then I went though all the stages of a breakup, made mistakes like trying to keep in contact with them, trying to show off on social media etc. I moved past that a while back once I accepted that there wasn’t any hope of reconciliation. I since removed her off of all social media. I’ve taken some time to reflect and improve on myself and I got back into dating a few weeks ago. I’ve had 4 dates so far. 2 of which I was catfished. One has lead to FWB but we both know it’s not gonna go any further as we’re just not each other’s type. And the last one there just wasn’t that romantic spark there so we agreed to remain as friends. I also get ghosted a lot while on these apps. and I’m honestly starting to loose hope of ever finding someone who I’m attracted to and have things in common with, and who I might want to be in a relationship with, I know I’ve got that FWB situation going on but I’m not really just after sex, I want companionship, someone to go on cute dates with and talk to about my day. Before my ex I had completely lost hope then  she came Into my life and I thought at one point that she was the one as she ticked almost every box for me. But in the end she changed after leaving the job where we met. Not just with me but she also cut off all of our mutual friends, who were people she was close to and never fell out with or anything, they were all confused as to why she just stopped talking to everyone. Idk anymore I know I’ve only been on the apps for 3-4 weeks now which isn’t that long but I’m just not getting anywhere it seems. Plus there are loads of girls on there from like a year or two back who I liked and matched with so that doesn’t exactly fill me with hope. I consider myself a decent looking guy, I also like to think I’m very caring and honest. I’m not one to lie or play games and I know I’m fiercely loyal when I am with someone. I just don’t know really what I can do to improve. I also struggle as an alternative person looking for someone else who’s into the same things as me. The only place I can go really is local clubs but idk how to approach someone in a nightclub I’m not exactly introverted but I’m not a social butterfly either. If any of you have words of wisdom or stories to share please do as I’m honestly thinking of just giving up at this point."},

All was understood and glad this was clear and upfront, but after it ended I came to a strange realization. Compared to all flings or real relationships (some more healthy/successful than others) I've had in the past it was the most authentic affection I've received so far. And the most I've wanted to give affection in return. I'm not particularly sad or regretful in any way cause I knew the conditions, but I'm startled that I can confidently say a less than two month fling felt more honest and caring than any previous entanglement had. I don't think it's because it is more fresh in my mind, just to state. I guess I just always felt like I did more or more was always expected from me than was ever given.

The tears on your face as we said I love you for the last time are forever imprinted in my memory. You don't know how badly I wanted to wipe them away, kiss your forehead, and promise you it would be okay. I knew I couldn't, because then I would never get out of your car. I've been trying to keep myself busy. Started going to the gym every day instead of every other. It hasn't really helped too much, but it's nice to keep my mind off you for a few hours. I stare at my bare ring finger more often than I should. I still instinctively go to grab my ring off my dresser when I wake up every morning, even though it's not there anymore. Everything makes me think of you. The cicadas chirping makes me think of us laughing when you told me they keep getting caught in your windshield. The news reminds me of our long drives where we would discuss politics and everything going on in the world. Every outfit I put on reminds me of when I would wear it with you. Inside Out 2 comes out in two days! I hope you're as excited as I am. I know we've been planning for months on watching it together on opening night. A part of me wonders if we'll be watching it at the same time at different theatres, laughing and crying at the same parts of it. Honestly, I'm probably just going to cry through this whole thing as I wish you were by my side while I watch. Maybe I'll wait to see it until I feel ready. I hope you still get to see it, though. I can't stop living in the \"what ifs\" of it all. What could have been different, what could have changed. I yearn for you. My heart feels half empty. I know it's unhealthy to live in the past, but the only way I've been able to fall asleep at night is when I replay our old memories in our head. Even then, I wake up in the middle of the night gasping and imagining the past few days have just been some fucked up nightmare. I had to mute your number, because every time my phone buzzed, deep down I hoped it was you. Even still, I find myself constantly looking at the little red numbers above the texting app, hoping it goes up by one. The amount of times I dialed your number just to not hit call is pathetic. I just need to hear your voice. I know this yearning is unhealthy, but I don't know when it will go away. I miss your smile, and the way your nose scrunches when you're really happy. I miss your silky black hair and your mocha skin. I miss your dark brown eyes that I would constantly get lost in. I miss your touch and I miss your kisses. I miss feeling the tightness when you squeeze me when we hug. I miss hearing your heart beat when I rest my head on your chest. I remember the first time I ever did that way back when we first staring dating and I could feel it racing, it made me blush. I miss your gentle voice and your roaring laugh. I miss our deep talks and our petty gossip. I even miss our fights, as dumb as that sounds. I just miss everything. It's been hard to scroll through social media because anytime I see something that reminds me of you, I want to send it to you. I've been sending them to my own number instead. In fact, to be honest, I've been texting my own number a lot. Whenever I want to text you, I just text it to myself. It still cuts like glass when the message immediately bounces back. Anyway, my eyes are getting misty so I'll stop here. Goodbye, my love. Maybe in another life, we'll do things right. I love you infinity plus one, ha I win."},

She told me she’d done some research online and wanted to go to Rigby & Peller at Bluewater shopping center in Kent. We drove there that evening, and I left her for half an hour to have a fitting appointment. I left her with my credit card and wandered around the shops for a while. I came back and waited outside the shop for her once it’d been about 25 minutes. She came out with the bra packaged inside a cord-handled bag. She was beaming with excitement. We sat down briefly and she showed me how they’d carefully wrapped it in tissue paper for her. As we drove home I just remember her telling me how comfortable it was when she tried it on , how the sales assistant had made her feel positive about it, and how special it made her feel. She told me the same thing a few times but I loved every moment of it. She’d never had a properly fitted bra before and it’s an experience that I think I enjoyed more just listening to how happy it made her 🥹"},

I've gone back and forth on if I should tell this story, but I'm a writer at heart and putting thoughts and emotions to words is how I work through it all, and maybe someone will read this and feel something, also so all the kids out there know that love is never simple, and you are bound to get caught up in it even well into your adult years. So back in January I met lets call her N, and we instantly connected. Like she called me the night after our coffee date to talk more, it was just so comfortable, we texted every day, called few times a week. Within a couple weeks we'd been on three more dates and made things official, after that we spent every weekend either at her place or mine, and occasionally got together during the week too. N and I have a dozen things in common, specific video games, humor, movies, and even our obscure fashion and interior design choices match. We shared personal, private pains. Before two months were up she had told me she loved me, I'd told her I was getting there, I had met her friends more than once, and we both had told our parents about each other. It seemed like a beautiful beginning. But then it ended suddenly. She had a bout of insecurities and she felt like she didn't deserve me, I couldn't convince her I was happy with her, and she ended things. But neither of us wanted the other out of our lives. We continued to talk every day, call each other, and we still regularly got together in person. After more than a month it looked from my side like we could start again, but N had an old long distance friend. This guy had never been too happy we were dating, and had decided now was a good time to come down and see N for the first time in years. I had an opportunity to tell N how I truly felt before he showed up, N and I had gone out drinking the night before he arrived, and though she showed doubt about what she wanted from her old friend, there was wonder too. So rather than throw an emotional bomb at her the night before, I kept my silence. I told her a week later, though I knew she had decided to be with him. I told her, not to confuse or ask anything of her, simply because she deserved to know. Her old insecurities had been wrong, and I still wanted to be a part of her life. She was not happy. Mad that I had taken so long to feel what she had felt months earlier, mad that I hadn't said anything that last night, mad that she thought I was only pretending to be friends, and even still insecure that I could still want someone like her in my life. That was only a month ago, and to this day we talk everyday, call at least once a week, and see each other nearly every week. We are both excited for an upcoming con, a game release later this year, and she expressed wanting to go to renn faire with me still. She is fast becoming my best friend, and I honestly am so happy I met her, I don't regret a thing. I don't know what the future holds, I'm casually looking for another partner, but mainly on bettering myself. We may or may not ever get back together, but I hope that in five years we are still talking every day, and getting together once a week to see each other. Love is beautiful in all forms, even at times in heartbreak and lost potential."},

I feel so connected to him, and I love him with my entire being. He's my person. The one I want to do everything with, the first person I tell about anything. The person I turn to for comfort, for laughter. I love exploring our city together just as much as I love exploring new places together. I love the small things just as much as I love the big things. His smile makes my heart melt and I've never been more interested in what anyone has to say than when he's talking about something he's passionate about. I feel so safe in his presence and I sleep better with him than I ever have. We've been talking about getting married for the past couple months and he's confirmed that he plans on getting me an engagement ring soon, and with our anniversary coming up at the end of the month I feel like it'll be around then. Plus, I saw him looking up rings. And I'm so excited. Whether he does it now or later, I'm just happy to know I'll be spending the rest of my life with him. I don't care about a big wedding or anything like that. I just can't wait to call him my husband, and to hear him call me his wife. Love, in all forms, is what makes life truly worth living. Connection, and shared experiences. Self love. The love of being a parent, or being a child. Closeness with your family, or building your own chosen family. Friendships, marriages, and pets. This is what it's about. And I'm eternally grateful to be filled with an infinite amount of love, and especially grateful to feel it back. ❤️"},

I’ve been seeing her for almost a year and I’m still anticipating someone popping out with a camera crew to let me know it’s all been a set up, but it never happens. I tried dating apps and asking people out for the better part of a decade not really feeling much of a connection or finding a spark that fizzled out quickly. In the last couple years I realized I was asexual. The general population is less than 1% ace, and of that one percent you’re lucky if you find 1 or 2 people you have something in common with. When I saw her dating profile I was floored. Someone who was more like me than anyone I’d ever seen on any dating app, ace, and incredibly beautiful. We hit it off pretty quickly through text chat and quickly moved to phone calls. We have similar niche hobbies, asthetics, work in the same industry, similar off brand humor, politics, values, and so many more things. She’s hilarious, nerdy, an incredible artist talented beyond her years, jaw dropping beautiful, smart, affectionate and caring. I have so many overwhelming feelings about her and our time together so far, like on our first date when she held my arm as we drunkenly walked the city streets looking at an festival market and playing ski ball together at the arcade, or our second date having a picnic in the botanical gardens, looking at all the Christmas lights in town til dark and doing star gazing. It’s been almost a year of dating and every one we go one seems impossibly magical  putting rom coms to shame. We spend a few evenings each week playing board games online, cracking jokes and telling each other about what’s going on in our lives. It’s been like finding a new best friend who I can also cuddle and shower with admiration. I’m mostly writing this because I can’t see her immediately and need to vent all this loving energy somewhere. I can’t wait til I get to see her again, sharing time with her just makes that time so much brighter!"},

{"Title": "To rekindle, or not to rekindle that is the question *lengthy*", "Author": "u/Traditional-Wait-827", "Content": "So there is a boy M (26?) and me F (28) that met about 8 years ago. We had mutuals so we would come around each other when our friends had kickbacks etc. I began to pursue him because I thought he was cute and liked him. Eventually he showed me that he reciprocated so we began to date and go out. We would go to sports games out to dinners & he would come over often to swim etc.  we had a real strong connection and all- This all happened so fast, but we were young and in love. even though I wanted him to make me his girlfriend he never did because he didn't know that I wanted that. Eventually I got back with my ex & we decided to stay as \"friends\". Obviously the relationship with my ex didn't work out and we ended up breaking up indefinitely. I continued to live my life, but I couldn't help but not being able to stop thinking about the one that got away. It has been years since we've talked and yet I feel like this- wondering what if?  One night while drinking with my friends I got the balls to reach out to him (the one who got away). I tried to rekindle our relationship and at first he was for it. He was a bit hesitant and still had a wall up which was understandable, but gradually he was letting me in. We decided we were going to take it slow and we were not girlfriend and boyfriend yet, but I was happy and content with how it was going. I was growing as a person in different aspects of my life and wanted him to be apart of it all. Sometime later that month I went hiking with my best friend that I call Main Squeeze, babe, bae all of the above (she’s been my bestie since middle school). We were making it a habit of going hiking every weekend. One Saturday when we went hiking, I posted on Twitter \"going hiking with bae\" & he saw it and immediately unfollowed me and ghosted me. l know from his perspective it seemed wrong, but I was seriously hiking with my best friend. Looking back now obvi that was stupid to do but I was young and dumb. Me being young, dumb and immature, I didn't think to reach out to him and I just let it be. I was being stubborn that he unfollowed me and left it as is. I never got to explain myself or tell him that it was only my best friend I was hiking with. Here I am 8 years later still thinking of him and now he was the one that got away. I keep thinking of where life could've taken us & how happy we could've been. It makes me sad because I want him to see the person that I am today, (grown with an education, car own place etc), I still have things I can work on & those are all materialistic things but I have worked so hard for the person I am today. I’m so proud of the woman I am today and wish he could be apart of this chapter of my life. Maybe a year or two after that incident I reached out to him through text. At that time he was in a relationship so he just responded with \" maybe you shouldn't be texting me lol\" I said OK and left it as is. Fast forward to today they are no longer together, that relationship did not last long and as far as I know he is single. I brought this up to my therapist and she encouraged me to maybe reach out now to just express my feelings and where I'm at right now, to do it now while we're single and not committed to anything. She said that might be easier because time will pass and if I wait for more time for us to be in committed relationships or even married with a family to then even think about reaching out will be difficult. So should I do it? Should I reach out? I don't want to be a bother. I don't want to be a fool or make a fool of myself. Should I just let it be and continue to live my life how l've been? It has been years since we've talked and yet I feel like this wondering what if?"},

I was over that person and I was ready the date. But the funny thing was, I decided to hop on PlayStation with my two friends wanting to play a video game to just pass the time since at the time I was living with my parents and I was waiting to go to work because at the time I didn’t have my license. so we played a game of Fortnite and rocket league and I think we did fall guys. But then I was talking to one of my friends and I said dude this whole. PlayStation list of people on here is very bare meaning I don’t have any person. I only had like my family and a few coworkers on there. And my friends from school when I graduated. I said to my friend I wish there was a way that I can find people and be friends with and just play video games because at the time I was still in a dark place I needed somebody to talk to like my friends didn’t really talk to me about that stuff because sometimes they would get annoyed And would not talk to them about it. So I hopped on Reddit. I had an old account where I went on the sub, but I had to delete it because of stuff happened, which explain another time but I went on there scrolled a few to see if anybody was willing to play a video game. I met one person. they were from the states like I was we didn’t really play any games. We just talked on discord that was really about it. We were talking for about a few weeks and they were likely busy a lot so we didn’t really get much talking to and I didn’t really get to play with them on video games so I was a little bummed out about that so I scrolled again on that sub Reddit to look then I found the post that would change my life like seriously she made a post about wanting to find people to play video games. There was a few people on that. That asked her to play video games. They gave their usernames to her and I was one of the few that gave her mine because I said hey I’m a girl if that matters. After a bit, I hopped on PlayStation and played with my friends, and I got a notification. Saying the infamous line hey are you from Reddit? And I said yes I’m from Reddit. Are you that person that made that post and obviously I was thinking oh my God I’m so stupid. Yes of course that is. We started talking for a bit. She asked me are you from the UK and I said I’m actually from the United States we started talking a little bit and we didn’t play any games at first she actually ghosted me for a bit lol and after that she came back and we started playing a video games together, and she asked me if I had discord and I gave her my username to her so after that, we actually started talking a lot more and we actually had so much in common we played video games and after a while we actually started having feelings for each other when we were talking about this not long ago she said she was the first person to fall in love with me even though I was like wait really I was shocked because I was the first person that fell in love with her so now the rest is history it’s been going on for almost 2 years now me and her together in December.

{"Title": "I think I handled this situation with my girlfriend well, but I’d like to be sure", "Author": "u/MichiganWinterBear", "Content": "So I have a question/story just trying to gauge if I handled this situation appropriately and carefully and thoughtfully. My girlfriend and I have been going through my out for 2 1/2-3 months or so, and yesterday she told me she thinks she loves me. I knew ahead of time I wasn’t going to say it until we were further into the relationship as I’ve gotten out of a 13 year marriage and want to be careful because she’s my first relationship post divorce. I do feel those feelings, I want to spend every day with her and when she leaves I’m very sad. The thing that’s made this relationship feel different is I am a different man than the one who was married for 13 years. It was a high school sweetheart relationship and we both had our failings but for my part I wasn’t emotionally mature enough to be the husband and loving partner I needed to be. I’ve made those changes with my new girlfriend and it’s been appreciated and shown. She makes me know I have changed into who I’ve wanted to be and appreciates when I’m trying in a way my ex just didn’t. We’ve also gone through some emotionally heavy times with my divorce obviously looming over our relationship and the grieving process for me that entails as well as her having lost her father this past week after a years long fight with cancer. I have been there for her in the way I always knew I could but never did with my ex wife. I’ve been supportive, I met her father on his deathbed, drove up the day after to support her. And we were lying in bed and she let out all of her emotions over his passing (she’d been handling it weirdly well in the days after until that moment). I held her while she cried as much as she needed and then she said she wanted to say something but was nervous. I had a feeling I knew what she was going to say but I tried to give her the space to because it felt like she really wanted to. And then she said it. “I think I love you” It made me flutter, it felt like every effort I’ve made on myself to be a better man to be a better partner were recognized by someone I enjoy so much and can see a future with. I responded with what I felt was the most heartfelt way while explaining where I was at. “I’m getting closer every day.” It’s an accurate description that I am getting to that point to say it back, that I’m building an emotional connection, I just can’t say it this close to when my marriage dissolved. But also I want her to know it’s not that I won’t be or that I’m emotionally unavailable. And to her absolute credit she said she didn’t need to hear it back, just that she needed to say it because she’s felt it since the day after I met her father. So I just want to be certain I handled this right, that I responded in the right way to say exactly how I feel: I will be there someday soon just not yet."},

I'm 27F and never been in love before, so I've no baseline for how it's supposed to feel. I tried researching it and one of the most common answers was \"you just know\" followed by \"if you have to ask, you're not\" but I'm not sure that'll be true for me as I'm a bit disconnected from my emotions. For instance, with my friends, they're great people, I love being around them and I want the best for them, but do I love them? I don't know. I can confidently say I love my best friend, but that's because I've known her 13 years. And I never had a \"wow, I love this girl\" revelation with her either. I only knew years down the line when I realised we'd built something permanent and substantial and we knew each other inside and out. It's the same with my family - I know I love them because they've been in my life for so long. I can't picture life without them. So I'd say love to me = familiarity and comfort. Is romantic love different? Less about the practicalities? I just don't understand. I like this guy a lot. I'm attracted to him physically but also emotionally. I'm a very shy person, I struggle with social anxiety, but when I'm with him I never worry about being judged or saying the wrong thing. I just feel completely at ease, like I can totally be myself. I've never been around him and thought \"man, I wish this would end.\" We always have fun together. I care about him and want to impress him, he's the first thing on my mind in the mornings and the last thing on my mind at night. Is this what love is supposed to be? I've never looked at him and had a magical revelation. I don't know if it'll last. But I know I want to keep showing up for him, and I hope he wants that too."},

He made sure we video call much as he can, we played games and watch YouTube together most nights. 10 months later he asked me to go to a $b concert. He already had a ticket but since the show was sold out he was looking around for one from around town for mine . I got the time off and flew over. He waited at the gate with some flowers for me. But he wasn’t able to get another ticket, so he sold his ticket. Even though  he was so excited and the reason he asked me to come fell through he wasn’t t upset, he was just happy I was there we just blasted it at home instead. my medication alerts changed because of the time difference and he woke up at 5am every morning to help me take my meds, I didn’t even ask. He had a month off work so he took me somewhere new every day. I met his whole family and they welcomed me immediately. And his friends are my friends now too! His mom picked me up when he was he went back to work, so I wasn’t home alone during the day all week. His mom told me she’s  never seen him this happy🥹 I have bpd, and I was still struggling when we first met. He’s always been there for me the good and the bad,  he is supportive and understanding and reassured me when I needed it, with his love and support I was able to get into a healthier mindset,with  that and therapy I was able to be in remission for my bpd. Recently we got married and I’ll be moving really soon! His family  checks up on me often while I’m back in America for the time being and helping me with the moving international process. Without his mom I’d be so lost! My husband is truly my better half 🖤"},

I do feel loved by him by actions rather, but it’s hard to gauge if he is feeling love yet. I really want to say it, but also the idea of not hearing it back makes me sad, so it kind of makes me not want to say it. But if he said it to me I would say it back in a heartbeat.

I feel like that this is more of a wedding vow or an engagement line, that requires at least a committed year together with all the highs and lows. The thing is, and this is something that I've observed, is that when a man is genuinely committed to their partner, he will move mountains, he will part seas for them, he will bring the sky down, if that's what it takes. People sing for love, live for love, kill for love, and die for love. And that's so true. You will literally start wars and make peace for love. I don't know, I probably should start actually dating someone. It's just hard being vulnerable, and it's really not something that I need to worry about right now, because of my other priorities. It would be nice, to be with someone. But I don't want to be with someone just to be with someone, I want it to be because I'm truly, madly, deeply, completely in love with them. That is the way. And my more Mandalorian side is showing now. Because they have to be your cyare . It's actually a little funny because, at least for me, love is deep, ocean deep to the hadosphere. It can be as beautiful as a sunfish, or as monstrous as an anglerfish. It depends on the day, and it depends on the people involved, and of course, the reciprocity. There's one thing I've learned though, you should never sacrifice your self-respect. That if somebody genuinely loves you, they will value your self-respect and your agency too much to allow you to burn it. Went from a question to an early morning philosophy rant. Sorry about that and have a great weekend."},

I really appreciated it but at the same time I noticed our conversations are becoming continuous throughout the day or maybe we just had a hard time but I find that when he has problems, he automatically calls me first which in turn lead me to reciprocate. He also messaged me about my facebook post commenting how lively I was and energetic on my post. I find his messages cute and sweet. It was the first time he commented about something I posted but he does seem to always check on me especially whenever I deactivate or reactivate in the past. In the past, when i deactivate, he really tries to message me through other means and when I reactivate, he welcomes me back. He also constantly ask about me often even if he is the one who got hospitalized and got major surgery. I don't know if we're getting too attached here or what's going on but we do seem to have shared problems and frequently update each other.

Instead of leaving me on delivered for 19 hours on a day we planned to hang out. I thought I was being as respectful and communicative as possible, but he hasn’t talked to me since. I even sent a follow up text yesterday night saying “hey did I say something that bothered you? If I did, that was not my intention and I just wanted to let you know how I felt in that moment. Do you want to talk?” I know it’s over since he hasn’t talked to me since and we have talked everyday since we first met, but also that it’s probably not healthy to be in a relationship with someone that can’t communicate anyway. I do feel really upset and sad because he was the first person I ever went on a date with and my first kiss. Any advice on how to heal from being hurt and basically ghosted?

My bf is short and skinny, so i wasnt expecting him to be lifting so heavy lol. When i saw him doing a squat lifting twice my weight, i swear i would have teared his clothes if no one was there. -when he drives. I dont think i need to explain this one. -he has asthma. When he takes his ventoline, i find it extremely sexy (i know its weird) -sometimes he just take my hand and kiss it without reason. -more serious here. He previously had eating disorders and body dysmorphia, due to being bullied in high school. He makes lot of effort to overcome it. He accept now when we do cheat meals bc he know it makes me happy.
