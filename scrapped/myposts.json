{"Title": "Loopy, high boyfriend coming off of anesthesia", "Author": "Unknown author", "Content": "My boyfriend (M21) had a very long, very invasive surgery today. He was under strong anesthesia for nearly 4 hours. They finally call and say we can come see him, but warned us he was EXTREMELY high from the anesthesia. I (F19) have been with him for almost a year and a half. We tell each other we love each other multiple times a day every day. I have never doubted he loves me. But today was just a new level. He comes out of the ICU, he doesn‚Äôt see me at first, and then the nurse points to me and says ‚Äúthere she is!‚Äù He looks at me, begins to cry and reaches his hands out for me like a baby, telling me I was the most beautiful thing he‚Äôs ever seen in the whole world, he is so happy to see me, he loves me, he can‚Äôt believe I‚Äôm his girlfriend, staring at my face, kissing my hands. The nurses told me he couldn‚Äôt stop talking about me when he woke up after the surgery. He grabbed my hand the whole way back to his room, and while we are in the room, every single time a nurse came in, he asked them ‚Äúisn‚Äôt she so pretty? This is my girlfriend!! She is so sweet‚Äù and I honestly could not keep myself from crying. He was in so much pain, yet he would still grab onto my hand and smile at me from his hospital bed. He would drift off to sleep still holding my hand, then wake up and freak out until I reassured him I was right next to him, and he would just smile so big and adorable and fall back asleep again. I don‚Äôt even know if he will remember all of this tomorrow, but I don‚Äôt care. I don‚Äôt know how I could love this boy even more, but I do. Just wanted to gush. Thanks Reddit"},
{"Title": "My wife is a SAHM and I kicked her out of the house", "Author": "Unknown author", "Content": "I M33 am married to my wife 32f She is a SAHM to three kids. 7,5,3. And I work from home full time and provide for my family. Through my office door, I can hear the kids definitely challenging her today. Just not listening, extra fussy. I left my office, and I can see all over my wife‚Äôs face that she is overwhelmed, stressed and tired. Sooo. I called off work, gave her my credit card, we both have bank cards. And a joint account that we both use freely. But for today, I think some serious retail therapy is in order. And I will pay the balance off at the end of the month. So I am the one with the credit card. I gave her kiss a hug and kicked her out of the house. I told her not to come back until she buys something for herself that she truly wants, eats a nice meal, drink a fancy drink, go get a message. Shoot, even book a hotel room for two days just to be by yourself and enjoy peace. Whatever you need to do for your self care, go do it! She gave me a kiss, a hug, didn‚Äôt fight me and left in her car. Will she be back? I‚Äôm not sure üòÖ Now im going to have a clam but firm conversation with our boys. On why they need to respect their mother. And challenge all of them on what we can do around the house to show her how much we love her. Before she gets back home.( if she comes back) You see as a dad, I don‚Äôt struggle with kids like she does. Granted I work 9-5 so I am not with them all day. But when I do have days off, or let my wife sleep in while I cook the kids breakfast, or their lunch. I don‚Äôt get any back talk, attitudes. What I say goes and that‚Äôs it. If the kids are getting in each other‚Äôs nerves, I give them a warning and they stop. I don‚Äôt yell at them or spank them. If my wife and I are together with the kids. It‚Äôs calm and quiet. As soon as I leave let‚Äôs say to go to the bathroom, store whatever. All Hell breaks loose. I grew up in a household where my parents were both physically, mentally and emotionally abusive to me. I wanted to kill myself at age five. My parents were both youth  pastors and prayed, encouraged and uplifted everyone at church. But behind closed doors. It was my hell. I survived suicide, alcoholism, depression and anxiety. I had really some serious trauma that I needed to work on. And learn how to love and be kind to myself. Admit my mistakes and confront my shame. Nearly killed me again. But made it out. Barley‚Ä¶. Now 33m I haven‚Äôt left my faith in God. And I promised my self once I have kids, I won‚Äôt be like my parents. I just feel so sorry for her and the stress she endures. I see her and acknowledge her hardship. I hope she stays out all day today and relaxes. So how can truly bring it home to my children. That they need to respect their mother? EDIT #1: my gosh! My DMs are blowing up so positive and some bad. To the positive ones I am enjoying the conversation and all your advice. As well as sharing my life story with you. And hearing your stories as well! To the bad dms and comments. I am sorry if it came across as me bragging or wanting kudos. This is not the case. I was just telling a story of my day. And legit wanted advice to be a better father. EDIT #2 : some people are hung on the credit card situation. She has her own credit card. We just paid it off and mutually decided together to do all the big spending on mine. Since we are in a one income household. We kept catch ourselves getting into debt and not communicating properly when we made purchases. So 2024 this was our New Year‚Äôs resolution we decided to do together when it comes to credit cards EDIT #3 : She did come back. I had a baby sitter on standby to watch the kids at night. And I took her to a nice relaxing restaurant and bought stuff at Ulta"},

Somehow even when she‚Äôs sleeping, she registers what‚Äôs going on in the outside world. I, on the other hand, have sleep problems so I‚Äôm usually up later than she is. Some reports: If I kiss her while she‚Äôs asleep, she always kisses back. If I tell her I love her while she‚Äôs asleep, she says it back. Bonus: if I whisper it, she whispers back too. If I shift around on the bed and get close to her shoulder, she kisses my forehead immediately. If I ask to cuddle, she immediately puts her arms around me and kisses me. Every time, she does this and goes right back to sleep. She‚Äôs only conscious for that split second it takes to respond. She has no memory of this in the morning.

{"Title": "I couldn‚Äôt reach my boyfriend for a while tonight and called him 15+ times before he answered. He was just sleeping. His reaction melted me.", "Author": "u/ams712", "Content": "Backstory: I am diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder. So yes, I have a problem, and I am actively working on it through medications and therapy. My boyfriend always calls me before he goes to sleep. If for some reason he falls asleep without calling, which is very rare, I call him before I go to sleep which has always woken him up. (We only sleep apart from each other once a week). Tonight for about an hour I couldn‚Äôt get a hold of him. Thinking back on it, rationally I should have realized he was probably deeply sleeping as he didn‚Äôt get much sleep the night before. But my anxiety convinced me he was dead somewhere. So my call finally woke him up and I just was a sobbing, blubbering mess. He didn‚Äôt once berate me, make excuses, or make me feel stupid. He just apologized (he had nothing to apologize for) and reassured me. I told him i felt crazy. He said that is not true. He told me that my anxiety is part of me and he loves all of me, even the anxiety. I‚Äôve never felt so reassured and safe. This man understands everything about me, even the parts I don‚Äôt truly understand fully. He understands my anxiety without ever having experienced it himself. He amazes me every day."},

She was wearing dark leggings that clung to her legs tightly and a very cute, fuzzy pink sweater that she'd just gotten for Christmas. Then, out of the blue in between words of our conversation, she leaned forward and gave me a kiss. Just a quick touching of our lips, then she leaned back upright, watching me silently with her big, beautiful blue eyes, like she was nervous about how I would react. I couldn‚Äôt stop smiling. I leaned forward and gave her a hug and a kiss on the head, stroking her hair and telling her how sweet she was and how soft her lips were. That was my first kiss, and hers too, and it felt wonderful. She said that it had taken a lot of courage for her to do that, but that she was glad she did. With me, of all people! At the end of the date, we kissed twice more in her driveway before I got in the car. Another quick kiss and one slightly longer one."},

We met as strangers on the internet. We had our first FaceTime just a day after exchanging emails. I‚Äôll never forget it. We are just 5 years apart in age. 8 months later we signed a lease on our first apartment together. It was nicer than anything either of us had ever stayed in. It was our home. We texted everyday ‚ÄúI love you‚Äù and ‚ÄúI love you more‚Äù. It was unlike any relationship I had ever had. It felt safe, and l felt loved. Sure we have our arguments but it tore us both apart to not be connected. The arguing would end in ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry‚Äù and ‚ÄúI hate being apart from you‚Äù. The pandemic hit and while many couples hated being locked up together, we found ways to have fun. We would shoot nerf guns at red solo cups we setup as targets. We started saving to buy a house. Then one day I got a message through Facebook from someone who said I was being cheated on. Sure enough it was true. My heart broke. I decided to forgive and we moved on. We got engaged, we bought our first house and took the in laws to Italy. Life was good but I had trust issues which then affected our sex life. We went to therapy but we still argued. And then late in 2023 I get a text from another person letting me know I‚Äôve been cheated on. It was true. That‚Äôs when I ended it. Of course I‚Äôm leaving so many details out because I don‚Äôt want this to be a longer post than it already is but I want to say this to all of you looking for love‚Ä¶ love with your whole heart. Love deep. Love is a risk and if I had the choice to do this all over again knowing how it would end, I would. But I‚Äôd still leave. True vulnerable love is the most beautiful and fullfilling feeling you can have. don‚Äôt take any moment for granted. Looking back, I did. I assumed that we‚Äôd always have each other and I regret focusing on work so much. no one is perfect. Own up to how you played a part in any arguments. Remember why you love each other. And I‚Äôll leave you with this‚Ä¶you‚Äôll know if you truly loved because in the end (whether death or breakup) you‚Äôll have to pay the toll and it‚Äôs grief. And it‚Äôs deep deep grief but it‚Äôs so worth it. Edit: to everyone telling me to get therapy, just stop. My post isn‚Äôt about asking for your help. Everyone‚Äôs journey is different and I alone made a very conscious choice to remain in my relationship. I‚Äôm not blaming anyone for my choices. That‚Äôs what being an adult is. My post left out many details for brevity sake so I‚Äôll mention here that the heavy grief is being felt on both sides. We hold each other and cry so hard some nights. Yes we still live together.

Actually we sleep together and for us it was very casual, like playing a video game together. And last month things took a turn. I went to her apartment (she's hardly 2 kilometers away) to hangout as usual and she seemed upset. She was pregnant! She cried to me, apologized but I tried to be a supportive friend. I dint blame her or anything cuz it's my responsibility too. Although I acted brave with her I've never slept a wink till yesterday. Thought of having a kid terrified me (she was too). We haven't told our mum and dad yet but we're telling them tomorrow. To the incident of today, for the last month I have been contemplating on my life till that time, about why I'm still single, why we've been sleeping together etc. At some point at night, I imagined a situation some guy marries a girl he made pregnant and suddenly I don't know why I replaced those people with us. That moment, I thought about how my life would be if we were a couple. I felt a little joy inside. I think that's how everyone feels about a person the love. I thought about all of our interactions for the last few years and it hit me hard why others took us for a couple. I was startled and felt awkward when I realised I have feelings for my best friend. I was really tensed, we're both strangers to romance and I was terribly scared to tell her. Some thing happened an hour ago, following and someone on reddit, I talked to her, mustering all the courage I can. I thought she will freak out and we never speak to each other again. But she wept, hugging me. She couldn't even speak properly when she said she loved me all this time, for years. I couldn't stop shedding some tears too even though I tried to look tough. She told me she was scared sick I might reject her. Said she always dropped hints.(I swear dint even realise it.) When I told her she said, \"You son of a b**ch I've been loving you for over six years\"!. I could not not drop my jaw. Anyway we promised to raise the kid together and make our relationship official and go on a date tomorrow evening. We don't know shit about dating but we are very optimistic about our future. I don't know if there will be a marriage in the future but we sure see us together. Edit: someone told me to asked her to write her side of the story. She agreed to post it soon"},

I think he feels it too, as he's been very vocal about wanting me and any chance he gets he'll come up and touch me or kiss me. He's always been more affectionate than me but lately it's been taken up several notches. I've caught him several times staring at me, checking me out, and looking love struck.

We‚Äôre both 20F and 20M Some backstory, I‚Äôve known him since around February. I met him in one of my classes and I could instantly tell he was shy/introverted/a little awkward which didn‚Äôt bother me. I started talking to him originally about the class and the worksheets we had but then it switched to different things like some things we enjoy. Well since about the beginning of may, I started to catch feelings for him. I know it‚Äôs taken him that long to open up by I feel like that‚Äôs a big part of my initial crush for him. I‚Äôve seen him open up to me from hiding in his shell all the time to coming out and showing me his true self. I feel so special knowing I‚Äôm one of the only people on this planet who can see who this shy, sweet, intelligent guy really is. It was around that time that I started to realize what a hidden gem I had discovered. So a couple months go by, my crush seemingly getting bigger with each passing day. Until I finally decided to just go and ask him out on a date. Nothing special or fancy, it was just us two at Dave and busters. Even his reaction was adorable! When I asked him, his cheeks flushed red and he had a smile on that he couldn‚Äôt wipe off. Everything went amazingly well during the date! I dressed in a nice pair of jeans and a nice shirt which got another cute reaction out of him. He blushed when he saw me and was a little speechless because he‚Äôd never seen me dressed up. We got some food to eat and we played a bunch of games throughout the store until we headed back home. I held his hand as we walked back to the valet. Again he blushed, smiled, and gave my hand a little squeeze. I seriously can‚Äôt get enough of his reactions to doing little things like when I kissed him goodbye, It was like a computer resetting with tons of blushing cheeksü•∞. He actually told me I was special to him because of the date and also the fact that I was the only person who decided to stick around and watch him come out of his shell and open up to someone. He likes that I‚Äôd invite him to go eat somewhere or hangout after class made a difference to him which is why around mid-April he started having feelings for me too. Ugh I seriously can‚Äôt get enough of that boy and how the smallest sign of affection will make him all happy and blush. It makes me feel special too because my previous partners wouldn‚Äôt care for those little acts of affection where it makes his week if I kiss him. ü•∞ü•∞ I‚Äôm just so happy right now üòä"},

I took off my jacket though and he just stared at me and my cute outfit, took off his glasses, then came up and kissed me so passionately I nearly melted into the floor. He basically told me he was sorry but he couldn't stop himself because I looked so good and he loved and missed me. Guys. Guys. Honestly despite rehearsing what I was going to say to him beforehand, I completely forgot my whole speech. I completely forgot what the dumb fight was even about. Hell I'm pretty sure for a while there, I completely forgot my own name. I think I blacked out for a bit because my heart was beating so fast. I felt like freaking anastasia steele when she was kissed in that elevator (fifty shades is a terrible movie but that scene was hot af). And because we don't really like having sex without fixing our issues, we managed to keep our hands off eachother for long enough to laugh about what a stupid fight we were having and to really discuss it all.

He would rarely initiate sex either. He told me, at one point, he was trying to avoid me. It hurts. It hurts being the person who still has so much love to work and fight for the relationship, but not getting any of that back. It hurts not being able to grow old with him, to grow with him, to face any challenges with him. It hurts watching him pull away, and me playing it off as tiredness. I hate feeling this way.

I left my office, and I can see all over my wife‚Äôs face that she is overwhelmed, stressed and tired. Sooo. I called off work, gave her my credit card, we both have bank cards. And a joint account that we both use freely. But for today, I think some serious retail therapy is in order. And I will pay the balance off at the end of the month.

I wanted to kill myself at age five. My parents were both youth  pastors and prayed, encouraged and uplifted everyone at church. But behind closed doors. It was my hell. I survived suicide, alcoholism, depression and anxiety. I had really some serious trauma that I needed to work on. And learn how to love and be kind to myself. Admit my mistakes and confront my shame. Nearly killed me again. But made it out. Barley‚Ä¶. Now 33m I haven‚Äôt left my faith in God.

Since we are in a one income household. We kept catch ourselves getting into debt and not communicating properly when we made purchases. So 2024 this was our New Year‚Äôs resolution we decided to do together when it comes to credit cards EDIT #3 : She did come back. I had a baby sitter on standby to watch the kids at night.

So yes, I have a problem, and I am actively working on it through medications and therapy. My boyfriend always calls me before he goes to sleep. If for some reason he falls asleep without calling, which is very rare, I call him before I go to sleep which has always woken him up. (We only sleep apart from each other once a week). Tonight for about an hour I couldn‚Äôt get a hold of him. Thinking back on it, rationally I should have realized he was probably deeply sleeping as he didn‚Äôt get much sleep the night before. But my anxiety convinced me he was dead somewhere. So my call finally woke him up and I just was a sobbing, blubbering mess. He didn‚Äôt once berate me, make excuses, or make me feel stupid. He just apologized (he had nothing to apologize for) and reassured me. I told him i felt crazy. He said that is not true. He told me that my anxiety is part of me and he loves all of me, even the anxiety. I‚Äôve never felt so reassured and safe. This man understands everything about me, even the parts I don‚Äôt truly understand fully. He understands my anxiety without ever having experienced it himself. He amazes me every day."},

We met as strangers on the internet. We had our first FaceTime just a day after exchanging emails. I‚Äôll never forget it. We are just 5 years apart in age. 8 months later we signed a lease on our first apartment together. It was nicer than anything either of us had ever stayed in. It was our home. We texted everyday ‚ÄúI love you‚Äù and ‚ÄúI love you more‚Äù. It was unlike any relationship I had ever had. It felt safe, and l felt loved. Sure we have our arguments but it tore us both apart to not be connected. The arguing would end in ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry‚Äù and ‚ÄúI hate being apart from you‚Äù. The pandemic hit and while many couples hated being locked up together, we found ways to have fun. We would shoot nerf guns at red solo cups we setup as targets. We started saving to buy a house. Then one day I got a message through Facebook from someone who said I was being cheated on. Sure enough it was true. My heart broke. I decided to forgive and we moved on. We got engaged, we bought our first house and took the in laws to Italy. Life was good but I had trust issues which then affected our sex life. We went to therapy but we still argued. And then late in 2023 I get a text from another person letting me know I‚Äôve been cheated on. It was true. That‚Äôs when I ended it. Of course I‚Äôm leaving so many details out because I don‚Äôt want this to be a longer post than it already is but I want to say this to all of you looking for love‚Ä¶ love with your whole heart. Love deep. Love is a risk and if I had the choice to do this all over again knowing how it would end, I would. But I‚Äôd still leave. True vulnerable love is the most beautiful and fullfilling feeling you can have. don‚Äôt take any moment for granted. Looking back, I did. I assumed that we‚Äôd always have each other and I regret focusing on work so much. no one is perfect. Own up to how you played a part in any arguments. Remember why you love each other. And I‚Äôll leave you with this‚Ä¶you‚Äôll know if you truly loved because in the end (whether death or breakup) you‚Äôll have to pay the toll and it‚Äôs grief. And it‚Äôs deep deep grief but it‚Äôs so worth it. Edit: to everyone telling me to get therapy, just stop. My post isn‚Äôt about asking for your help. Everyone‚Äôs journey is different and I alone made a very conscious choice to remain in my relationship. I‚Äôm not blaming anyone for my choices. That‚Äôs what being an adult is. My post left out many details for brevity sake so I‚Äôll mention here that the heavy grief is being felt on both sides. We hold each other and cry so hard some nights. Yes we still live together.

We've been friends since 20. We hang out most often and have sleepovers. She's kinda socially awkward and we're each other's best friend. We watch movies together, have drinks, beer mostly and share everything with each other, fight occasionally too. Even our parents mistook us for a couple, but we never imagined it in our wildest dreams. All these times we never had any feelings to each other, at least that's what I thought and we have not dated anyone else. A year ago unexpectedly we started sleeping together, we became FWB. People say its really bad to be FWB with your best friend but in our case it dint ruin our friendship or made anything weird. Actually we sleep together and for us it was very casual, like playing a video game together. And last month things took a turn. I went to her apartment (she's hardly 2 kilometers away) to hangout as usual and she seemed upset. She was pregnant! She cried to me, apologized but I tried to be a supportive friend. I dint blame her or anything cuz it's my responsibility too. Although I acted brave with her I've never slept a wink till yesterday. Thought of having a kid terrified me (she was too). We haven't told our mum and dad yet but we're telling them tomorrow. To the incident of today, for the last month I have been contemplating on my life till that time, about why I'm still single, why we've been sleeping together etc. At some point at night, I imagined a situation some guy marries a girl he made pregnant and suddenly I don't know why I replaced those people with us. That moment, I thought about how my life would be if we were a couple. I felt a little joy inside. I think that's how everyone feels about a person the love. I thought about all of our interactions for the last few years and it hit me hard why others took us for a couple. I was startled and felt awkward when I realised I have feelings for my best friend. I was really tensed, we're both strangers to romance and I was terribly scared to tell her. Some thing happened an hour ago, following and someone on reddit, I talked to her, mustering all the courage I can. I thought she will freak out and we never speak to each other again. But she wept, hugging me. She couldn't even speak properly when she said she loved me all this time, for years. I couldn't stop shedding some tears too even though I tried to look tough. She told me she was scared sick I might reject her. Said she always dropped hints.(I swear dint even realise it.) When I told her she said, \"You son of a b**ch I've been loving you for over six years\"!. I could not not drop my jaw. Anyway we promised to raise the kid together and make our relationship official and go on a date tomorrow evening. We don't know shit about dating but we are very optimistic about our future.

I‚Äôve been left a lot. I‚Äôve been afraid he would leave me with everything going on. We closed on our house on Wednesday, and due to a clerical error his name got left off all the documents.

We don‚Äôt have any furniture yet. We have been sleeping on the floor. It hurts his back and he‚Äôs been saying how uncomfortable sleeping on the floor is. So. ....We borrowed an air mattress from a friend. It‚Äôs SMOL. I‚Äôm used to sleeping on the floor. I lived in my car for a year. It‚Äôs not the most comfortable. But I can tolerate it pretty well. I let him sleep on the air mattress last night because I wanted him to be comfortable. Or bed is supposed to get delivered Monday. This morning, I woke up with him next to me on the floor. Snuggled up against my back. He said he couldn‚Äôt wait until Monday to sleep next to me. He slept on the floor just to cuddle me.  I‚Äôm full of doubts and insecurities but he always seems to make them better. I cried this morning when he said that. We may be going through an extremely stressful time right now but I love him and he loves me. I slept on the floor so he could be comfortable. He slept on the floor because he wasn‚Äôt comfortable without me. We both slept on the floor last night."},

I met him in one of my classes and I could instantly tell he was shy/introverted/a little awkward which didn‚Äôt bother me. I started talking to him originally about the class and the worksheets we had but then it switched to different things like some things we enjoy. Well since about the beginning of may, I started to catch feelings for him. I know it‚Äôs taken him that long to open up by I feel like that‚Äôs a big part of my initial crush for him. I‚Äôve seen him open up to me from hiding in his shell all the time to coming out and showing me his true self. I feel so special knowing I‚Äôm one of the only people on this planet who can see who this shy, sweet, intelligent guy really is. It was around that time that I started to realize what a hidden gem I had discovered. So a couple months go by, my crush seemingly getting bigger with each passing day. Until I finally decided to just go and ask him out on a date. Nothing special or fancy, it was just us two at Dave and busters. Even his reaction was adorable! When I asked him, his cheeks flushed red and he had a smile on that he couldn‚Äôt wipe off. Everything went amazingly well during the date! I dressed in a nice pair of jeans and a nice shirt which got another cute reaction out of him. He blushed when he saw me and was a little speechless because he‚Äôd never seen me dressed up. We got some food to eat and we played a bunch of games throughout the store until we headed back home. I held his hand as we walked back to the valet. Again he blushed, smiled, and gave my hand a little squeeze. I seriously can‚Äôt get enough of his reactions to doing little things like when I kissed him goodbye, It was like a computer resetting with tons of blushing cheeksü•∞. He actually told me I was special to him because of the date and also the fact that I was the only person who decided to stick around and watch him come out of his shell and open up to someone. He likes that I‚Äôd invite him to go eat somewhere or hangout after class made a difference to him which is why around mid-April he started having feelings for me too. Ugh I seriously can‚Äôt get enough of that boy and how the smallest sign of affection will make him all happy and blush. It makes me feel special too because my previous partners wouldn‚Äôt care for those little acts of affection where it makes his week if I kiss him. ü•∞ü•∞ I‚Äôm just so happy right now üòä"},

We hadn't seen each other in a couple days but had been fighting mainly over the phone, and the next time we saw each other it was with a group of people, so we didn't really get a chance to air it out in person until later that night. When we were finally alone and he got into my bedroom, I sighed and closed the door, ready to hash it out with him. Really give him a piece of my mind, yknow? I took off my jacket though and he just stared at me and my cute outfit, took off his glasses, then came up and kissed me so passionately I nearly melted into the floor. He basically told me he was sorry but he couldn't stop himself because I looked so good and he loved and missed me. Guys. Guys. Honestly despite rehearsing what I was going to say to him beforehand, I completely forgot my whole speech. I completely forgot what the dumb fight was even about. Hell I'm pretty sure for a while there, I completely forgot my own name. I think I blacked out for a bit because my heart was beating so fast. I felt like freaking anastasia steele when she was kissed in that elevator (fifty shades is a terrible movie but that scene was hot af). And because we don't really like having sex without fixing our issues, we managed to keep our hands off eachother for long enough to laugh about what a stupid fight we were having and to really discuss it all. He triple checked with me that I was okay with everything before proceeding to blow my mind again...if you know what I mean.

He would rarely initiate sex either. He told me, at one point, he was trying to avoid me. It hurts. It hurts being the person who still has so much love to work and fight for the relationship, but not getting any of that back. It hurts not being able to grow old with him, to grow with him, to face any challenges with him. It hurts watching him pull away, and me playing it off as tiredness. I hate feeling this way. It feels like a rug was pulled under me. It's hard to fight back the tears. ETA: Thank you for your support and kind comments.

Also I just have been recovering from months of daily anxiety and bad panic attacks and I struggled a lot with eating and didn't eat enough. When I met him, everything happened just so naturally. In the beginning I just thought: maybe we'll be friends. I didn't even want any romantic thoughts in my head. But with the time passing and us spending a lot of time together (almost every day), I more and more noticed that he actually was exactly the person I have always been wishing for to be in my life. He is really smart, we laugh about the same stuff, we both like learning new things and gaming, the list goes on... but especially emotionally we're just so similar which is really important to me. In addition, after meeting him and spending a lot of time with him, my anxiety became even less and when I was around him I had almost no more problems eating. I felt he was really good for me. After one month of knowing each other, he kissed me and after 3 months we officially got together as a couple and I am really happy with him because he makes me a better person.

I told her this once while we were talking and I didn't wanna sound weird so I changed the topic soon after because I don't wanna seem over clingy. So the next time we went on a date, I got kinda nervous in between and she offered to hold hands. She said she remembered when I told her that I like being in contact. I got overwhelmed with emotions, small things like that really make me feel better. She's the most amazing person ever and I hope I can be her dream guy one day because she is my dream girl.

He will vehemently deny all the sleepy allegations, even when he‚Äôs outright snoring he will say he‚Äôs just resting his eyes. I think it is absolutely sweet.

The other night we were snuggling and watching tv and I was laying behind him with my arm under his pillow and my head against his back. At one point I fell asleep and when I woke up he had scooted forward so my hand was right next to his face and he was resting his head in the palm of my hand just giving little tiny kisses to my fingers and the palm of my hand while watching tv. It was the cutest thing ever and I don‚Äôt even think he realized he was doing it which made it even cuter. I loved it so much that I just laid there and didn‚Äôt move and pretended I was still asleep because I didn‚Äôt want him to be embarrassed and stop!! It makes me sooooo happy to see him be lovey dovey and vulnerable with me because so many men have a hard time expressing their feelings and he had a hard time with it for such a long time and he doesn‚Äôt really open up 100% to anyone, but he seems to be coming around to me.

And ever since then his default was to sit next to me, without me even mentioning or asking for it. The waiter would put two menus across from each other, and he would just slide the menus next to each other and sit beside me so nonchalantly. It makes me melt every-time he does that.

Life just happens in a way you never expect. But, I have also noticed that she‚Äôd been enjoying the things she used to less and less. She‚Äôs really been struggling with her mental health and while I found her a therapist and encouraged her to see friends and do new things it wasn‚Äôt really helping. She‚Äôs been unsure of what she wants to do in life, and I‚Äôve just been encouraging her to pursue her interests whatever they may be but even so she‚Äôs still just been so sad. She ended talking to me after the breakup and telling me why she left me, that she‚Äôd been putting so much of her own self worth and existence on the fact that I loved her. That she‚Äôd been pushing herself to the limit just to try to have me constantly love her so she could feel like she mattered. That despite the fact that I wanted to put her first and to have her focus on herself she never could because she thought she would be letting me down in some way. I think I cried harder than I have in years. While her leaving me is devastating, I also see the woman I fell in love with through the talk. She‚Äôs such a fiercely strong and emotionally intelligent person and that she has been able to recognize this and made this decision, even though it was hard for her, makes me so proud. I‚Äôm so happy she can take this step for herself and I truly hope she can find herself again, but if the talk was any indication then I think the woman I love will be just fine. While I am immensely sad that I lost someone I thought I had a forever with, I‚Äôd be so much more sad if she stayed with me at her own expense. I think I just love her more for doing this for herself, even if it‚Äôs not meant to be for now, or ever. She will always hold such an important place in my heart, she taught me so much and I loved her in every moment. I do hope that I might one day have another chance with her, however, even if not I‚Äôll be okay, just knowing she‚Äôs doing better and is happy is more than enough for me."},

Yesterday he asked me if I'm feeling alright, and I said I have a headache I guess. He asked if it's coffee withdrawal, since he hasn't seen me drink any recently, and I said it shouldn't be, since it's been days. Today I woke up to him awkwardly clunking around the coffee machine. He doesn't know how to use it. He doesn't drink coffee, he's never made any, but he figured he'd make me coffee. He's also started doing something he's never done before - playing some online team playing videogames with his friend he hadn't really spent much time with. I'm guessing the friend is also a more active person, and he's quarantined too, so my boyfriend is keeping him company, chatting with the headphones while they play.

After hours of talking and listening to music,  I start to fall asleep in the passenger seat but wake up shortly after to him singing to songs I had no idea he was interested in, word for word.

Also I just have been recovering from months of daily anxiety and bad panic attacks and I struggled a lot with eating and didn't eat enough. When I met him, everything happened just so naturally. In the beginning I just thought: maybe we'll be friends. I didn't even want any romantic thoughts in my head. But with the time passing and us spending a lot of time together (almost every day), I more and more noticed that he actually was exactly the person I have always been wishing for to be in my life. He is really smart, we laugh about the same stuff, we both like learning new things and gaming, the list goes on... but especially emotionally we're just so similar which is really important to me. In addition, after meeting him and spending a lot of time with him, my anxiety became even less and when I was around him I had almost no more problems eating. I felt he was really good for me. After one month of knowing each other, he kissed me and after 3 months we officially got together as a couple and I am really happy with him because he makes me a better person.

He will vehemently deny all the sleepy allegations, even when he‚Äôs outright snoring he will say he‚Äôs just resting his eyes. I think it is absolutely sweet.

The other night we were snuggling and watching tv and I was laying behind him with my arm under his pillow and my head against his back. At one point I fell asleep and when I woke up he had scooted forward so my hand was right next to his face and he was resting his head in the palm of my hand just giving little tiny kisses to my fingers and the palm of my hand while watching tv. It was the cutest thing ever and I don‚Äôt even think he realized he was doing it which made it even cuter. I loved it so much that I just laid there and didn‚Äôt move and pretended I was still asleep because I didn‚Äôt want him to be embarrassed and stop!! It makes me sooooo happy to see him be lovey dovey and vulnerable with me because so many men have a hard time expressing their feelings and he had a hard time with it for such a long time and he doesn‚Äôt really open up 100% to anyone, but he seems to be coming around to me. I absolutely adore him and I can‚Äôt wait to spend my whole life getting little hand kisses from him."},

And ever since then his default was to sit next to me, without me even mentioning or asking for it. The waiter would put two menus across from each other, and he would just slide the menus next to each other and sit beside me so nonchalantly. It makes me melt every-time he does that. We would even sit next to each other with an extremely tiny table. To be honest, he probably doesn‚Äôt realize all the small things he does that mean so much to me.

Life just happens in a way you never expect. But, I have also noticed that she‚Äôd been enjoying the things she used to less and less. She‚Äôs really been struggling with her mental health and while I found her a therapist and encouraged her to see friends and do new things it wasn‚Äôt really helping. She‚Äôs been unsure of what she wants to do in life, and I‚Äôve just been encouraging her to pursue her interests whatever they may be but even so she‚Äôs still just been so sad. She ended talking to me after the breakup and telling me why she left me, that she‚Äôd been putting so much of her own self worth and existence on the fact that I loved her. That she‚Äôd been pushing herself to the limit just to try to have me constantly love her so she could feel like she mattered. That despite the fact that I wanted to put her first and to have her focus on herself she never could because she thought she would be letting me down in some way. I think I cried harder than I have in years. While her leaving me is devastating, I also see the woman I fell in love with through the talk. She‚Äôs such a fiercely strong and emotionally intelligent person and that she has been able to recognize this and made this decision, even though it was hard for her, makes me so proud. I‚Äôm so happy she can take this step for herself and I truly hope she can find herself again, but if the talk was any indication then I think the woman I love will be just fine. While I am immensely sad that I lost someone I thought I had a forever with, I‚Äôd be so much more sad if she stayed with me at her own expense. I think I just love her more for doing this for herself, even if it‚Äôs not meant to be for now, or ever. She will always hold such an important place in my heart, she taught me so much and I loved her in every moment. I do hope that I might one day have another chance with her, however, even if not I‚Äôll be okay, just knowing she‚Äôs doing better and is happy is more than enough for me."},

He asked if it's coffee withdrawal, since he hasn't seen me drink any recently, and I said it shouldn't be, since it's been days. Today I woke up to him awkwardly clunking around the coffee machine. He doesn't know how to use it. He doesn't drink coffee, he's never made any, but he figured he'd make me coffee. He's also started doing something he's never done before - playing some online team playing videogames with his friend he hadn't really spent much time with. I'm guessing the friend is also a more active person, and he's quarantined too, so my boyfriend is keeping him company, chatting with the headphones while they play.

Once he had talked about wanting me to come see him at work in conversation, which gave me an idea. I didnt let myself react to it that much in hopes that'd he forget his own comment, so I gave him kind of an \"Oh yeah, I should when our work schedules line up.\" nonchalant response. I really wanted to catch him off guard, but I really wanted to see him. Well the day arrived when our schedules lined up. I got off work while he was a couple hours into his shift. I texted him that I was leaving work, like I normally do and usually I text him when I get to our house if he's not already there. Again, the art of surprise needed to be on my side so I had to get sneaky. So I knew I had to time my drive right as to not raise any suspicion... (occasionally he'll check my location around the time I'm supposed to arrive home so he knows I did safely). So, I'm calculating that if it takes me 15 minutes to get home and it'll take me 25 minutes to get to his work... I can totally make it so it doesn't look suspicious. I booked it. I made that 25 into 18. When I pulled into the parking lot of his store my heart was racing! I was just giddy to see him and his reaction. Even though we've been together for a little over a year now, he still puts butterflies in my stomach. He was working the registers, I could see him walk past the front doors and thought, \"Well shit, he'll see me right off the bat!\" Kind of an oh well, but I march my ass up to the store, (think like a smaller Lowe's/Home Depot) and walk through the doors. I look at him and... he's fucking oblivious, has no clue I walked in. I'm probably like a giant alligators length away from him. I quickly just decided to keep it that way and I disappeared for a few moments between the shelves, just wandering. I finally pop in his checkout line and wait. I watch him, he looks so stern. His lips pursed just a little bit, eyes look bored, but his movements are quick and efficient. He's a good worker, but he definitely has resting bitch face syndrome. I think its cute. I'm still standing in line holding my fricking breath. Every time he looks up from his register and glances around I wonder if he'll FINALLY see me. He glances up once again, scans the line and lands on me, double takes for half a second and immediately the biggest smile spreads over his face accompanied by a slight head tilt. Kind of as  a silent \"Hey you're here?!\". Watching his eyes light up and him smile at me like that just made me grin back just as hard. I love him so much and I love how happy he got as soon as he saw me and that smile didnt leave either of our faces. I know it's such a silly thing and it's not like we dont see each other every day because we live together, but I'm just glad I got that sweet little moment with him. TL;DR I got a little sneaky the other day so I could catch my boyfriend off guard at work. He made my heart melt when he lit up like a Christmas tree as soon as he saw me. So cute. EDIT: Aw guys thank you so much for the support! I never thought I get this much attention from this post, I was literally gushing so hard internally I had to let some of it spill. I showed my boyfriend the post and he immediately was all smiles and said \"We're famous now!\". He also made me show his mom, she read it and she thought it was sweet/funny and we had a laugh over, \"Oh yeah, he totally does have resting bitch face\" and his gleeful, but jokingly cocky bragging about our new found \"fame\". Im just so thankful for my boyfriend he's so sweet and cute and gushy. You know how when you see a puppy or a baby and it's just so adorable you have to clench your teeth and your stomach ties up in knots from excitement and you just wanna, I dunno, have that weird urge to like eat it or maybe just squeeze it really hard or something? Maybe someone will understand the feeling I'm trying to describe. Lol I promise I'm not crazy, I just have really intense emotions for this boy. THANK YOU!"},

I didn‚Äôt tell her where we were going. See, about 9 months ago(1 month into our relationship), I went to this place called the Red Line Diner. I LOVED the aesthetic. It was a very old school, longways type diner, you know what I mean. I remember telling the worker there that I‚Äôd definitely be bringing my girlfriend here at some point. Well, fast forward. I got home from work one day. She was all made up, absolutely beautiful. I put my leather jacket on and we drove about 30 minutes to get where we were going. Once again, she had no idea. We got there, both absolutely hungry. I ordered a large Buffalo chicken salad, chicken strips with a side of Honey Mustard, and some deep fried Oreos. She ordered a small Buffalo chicken salad, a bacon cheeseburger, and some bacon cheese fries, and we both got Pepsi‚Äôs. When we were waiting for our food, I just saw her scanning the room, appreciating it like she was a kid in the candy store. I took an opportunity and snapped a pic of her, it‚Äôs one of my absolute favorite pictures of her. Her eyes are shining and she looks so happy. It makes me melt. The food? Absolutely delicious. It did not disappoint. I knew in my head that if I didn‚Äôt pay for it without her knowing, she would insist on paying for her own meal. She‚Äôd put up a fight. I admire her independence. So, I snuck to the ‚Äúbathroom‚Äù and paid the bill. She was all like: ‚ÄúYou know you didn‚Äôt have to do that, I could‚Äôve paid for myself.‚Äù I responded with: ‚ÄúListen, you paid for my dinner last time, I don‚Äôt want you to worry about the bill, this time.‚Äù She smiled and thanked me, gave me a big kiss on my forehead and we went home to sleep peacefully with our filled up tummies."},

It's really rare for us to get on each other's nerves cause we are the kind of couple who just get along well effortlessly. He was tired and I was tired as well and one thing led to another. We were yelling at each other and it was horrible. so I decided to sleep in another room. But I wasn't able to. We always used to cuddle while sleeping. We loved to keep our bodies as close to each other as we can. His warmth, his smell, his soft nuzzles, and snores. I loved sleeping with him as it gave me a feeling of being protected and loved. But today was not the case. So I lay on the bed thinking deep of the situation I was in and what I could have done. I realized that no matter who was at fault, it was wrong of me to raise my voice. And once I reached this realization, I ran back to our shared room. When I opened the door, I saw him sitting on the bed with a pillow in his lap. I met his eyes and knew it in an instant that he reached the same realization. I wanted to apologize first. \"I am sorry for raising my voice on you. No matter what happened, I should have seen things from your perspective as well. I am so selfish. It's just that I went to lay in that dark room all alone by myself and it hit me that this is the kind of place where I don't want to be. My body craves for your warmth. For your soft lisps, your soft nuzzles, and when you hug me tighter in the middle of the night. I missed you. I missed you so much when you weren't even gone anywhere. And I can't imagine anything happening to us so I am here to apologize.\" I was actually sobbing while saying all this to him. He just looked me with a soft look in his eyes and pulled me in a warm embrace. It was so soothing and reassuring. \"Let's sleep now, okay? We will talk about this tomorrow\" He said in his soft voice. \"yes\" And I was there. Once again, beside him, feeling loved and protected again. He woke up early and made me some breakfast and then we talked about our fight and our opinions. We reached a mutual understanding and played Mario kart after that (I absolutely slaughtered him in the game btw ;) I wanted to write about this just to tell you that don't give up on love. Its never too late and you can always do something about it. Try to communicate with your partner, get to know what she/he/they want, be honest with him/her/them, and don't give up.

I texted him that I was leaving work, like I normally do and usually I text him when I get to our house if he's not already there. Again, the art of surprise needed to be on my side so I had to get sneaky. So I knew I had to time my drive right as to not raise any suspicion... (occasionally he'll check my location around the time I'm supposed to arrive home so he knows I did safely). So, I'm calculating that if it takes me 15 minutes to get home and it'll take me 25 minutes to get to his work... I can totally make it so it doesn't look suspicious. I booked it. I made that 25 into 18. When I pulled into the parking lot of his store my heart was racing! I was just giddy to see him and his reaction. Even though we've been together for a little over a year now, he still puts butterflies in my stomach. He was working the registers, I could see him walk past the front doors and thought, \"Well shit, he'll see me right off the bat!\" Kind of an oh well, but I march my ass up to the store, (think like a smaller Lowe's/Home Depot) and walk through the doors.

I didn‚Äôt tell her where we were going. See, about 9 months ago(1 month into our relationship), I went to this place called the Red Line Diner. I LOVED the aesthetic. It was a very old school, longways type diner, you know what I mean. I remember telling the worker there that I‚Äôd definitely be bringing my girlfriend here at some point. Well, fast forward. I got home from work one day. She was all made up, absolutely beautiful. I put my leather jacket on and we drove about 30 minutes to get where we were going. Once again, she had no idea. We got there, both absolutely hungry. I ordered a large Buffalo chicken salad, chicken strips with a side of Honey Mustard, and some deep fried Oreos. She ordered a small Buffalo chicken salad, a bacon cheeseburger, and some bacon cheese fries, and we both got Pepsi‚Äôs. When we were waiting for our food, I just saw her scanning the room, appreciating it like she was a kid in the candy store. I took an opportunity and snapped a pic of her, it‚Äôs one of my absolute favorite pictures of her. Her eyes are shining and she looks so happy. It makes me melt. The food? Absolutely delicious. It did not disappoint. I knew in my head that if I didn‚Äôt pay for it without her knowing, she would insist on paying for her own meal. She‚Äôd put up a fight. I admire her independence. So, I snuck to the ‚Äúbathroom‚Äù and paid the bill. She was all like: ‚ÄúYou know you didn‚Äôt have to do that, I could‚Äôve paid for myself.‚Äù I responded with: ‚ÄúListen, you paid for my dinner last time, I don‚Äôt want you to worry about the bill, this time.‚Äù She smiled and thanked me, gave me a big kiss on my forehead and we went home to sleep peacefully with our filled up tummies."},

It's really rare for us to get on each other's nerves cause we are the kind of couple who just get along well effortlessly. He was tired and I was tired as well and one thing led to another. We were yelling at each other and it was horrible. so I decided to sleep in another room. But I wasn't able to. We always used to cuddle while sleeping. We loved to keep our bodies as close to each other as we can. His warmth, his smell, his soft nuzzles, and snores. I loved sleeping with him as it gave me a feeling of being protected and loved. But today was not the case. So I lay on the bed thinking deep of the situation I was in and what I could have done. I realized that no matter who was at fault, it was wrong of me to raise my voice. And once I reached this realization, I ran back to our shared room. When I opened the door, I saw him sitting on the bed with a pillow in his lap. I met his eyes and knew it in an instant that he reached the same realization. I wanted to apologize first. \"I am sorry for raising my voice on you. No matter what happened, I should have seen things from your perspective as well. I am so selfish. It's just that I went to lay in that dark room all alone by myself and it hit me that this is the kind of place where I don't want to be. My body craves for your warmth. For your soft lisps, your soft nuzzles, and when you hug me tighter in the middle of the night. I missed you. I missed you so much when you weren't even gone anywhere. And I can't imagine anything happening to us so I am here to apologize.\" I was actually sobbing while saying all this to him. He just looked me with a soft look in his eyes and pulled me in a warm embrace. It was so soothing and reassuring. \"Let's sleep now, okay? We will talk about this tomorrow\" He said in his soft voice. \"yes\" And I was there. Once again, beside him, feeling loved and protected again. He woke up early and made me some breakfast and then we talked about our fight and our opinions. We reached a mutual understanding and played Mario kart after that (I absolutely slaughtered him in the game btw ;) I wanted to write about this just to tell you that don't give up on love. Its never too late and you can always do something about it. Try to communicate with your partner, get to know what she/he/they want, be honest with him/her/them, and don't give up. There is still hope. There is still love."},

Sometimes my insecurities from the past creep up and last night I asked him, ‚ÄúAren‚Äôt I too much sometimes?‚Äù He responded, ‚ÄúNo. What do you mean?‚Äù And I reminded him that even I know I can still be way intense, energetic, and physically and emotionally needy sometimes and he said, ‚ÄúWell that‚Äôs you and I just love you.

I‚Äôve finished chemo 2 1/2 months ago, and I‚Äôve just now started to look a bit more like a human being, lol. Seeing how I looked over the past few months breaks my heart, honestly. I wasn‚Äôt doing too bad physically all things considered, but holy shit, I looked like I was from a different species at times. Deep bags under my eyes, blue lips, yellow skin, bald, eyebrows gone‚Ä¶ picture a naked mole rat on the brink of death and yeah, that‚Äôs exactly what I looked like at times. And yet, my boyfriend constantly made me feel like the sun shined out of my bald ass. Frankly speaking, I have no idea how we have managed to have an active sex life while I was going through treatment, but he didn‚Äôt make it look difficult at all. Mind you, this is not a long relationship: I am 23, he‚Äôs 25, and we‚Äôve been together for just a bit over 6 months now. We‚Äôve met while I was going through treatment: I never would‚Äôve started a relationship in those circumstances, but he made it seem like the easiest, most natural thing. He has known about my condition from the very start, and he has never been intimidated by it. If anything, I feel like it makes him love me even more. My last boyfriend broke up with me due to cancer, so this is such a huge deal for me. He takes care of me with such kindness and patience, I don‚Äôt know how he does it. He has never made me feel like a burden in the slightest. Whenever I feel bad, either physically or mentally, he just showers me with a seemingly infinite supply of love and care. I can‚Äôt believe I am lucky enough to have someone like him in my life. Staying alive is so hard at times, but it becomes easy when I think of those in my life who want me to stay alive. If my cancer ever recurs, I‚Äôll take any treatment with a smile on my face for more time with those I love, him especially. With how hard it‚Äôs been at times, I feel like staying alive and sane is the biggest act of love I have to give. I didn‚Äôt think men like him existed, especially after my last boyfriend - but they do. If any of you reading this ever feel like you‚Äôre too much for anyone to love, take me as living (for now, LOL) proof that there‚Äôs someone out there for you. The right person will think that what was ‚Äútoo much‚Äù for someone else is just right for them."},

{"Title": "My boyfriend keeps making me coffees that I can barely keep down but I will \"gladly\" keep drinking them", "Author": "u/thepieintheoven", "Content": "When I was younger my mom used to make what she would call \"children's coffee\", which was essentially heated soy milk (I'm lactose intolerant) mixed with a bit of instant coffee powder. One day while my bf and I were at my parents' house, I asked my mom to make me this \"children's coffee\" and my boyfriend asked me what that was and I explained the story behind it and how I used to drink it a lot when I was younger. That's where it all began. Ffw a few weeks, we're at his mom's house and for a change there's soy milk in the fridge there (leftover from a family holiday we went on) so he asks me if I want children's coffee. Surprised, I asked him if he wanted to make it for me and he said yes. So obviously I agreed, it's a cute gesture. And it was good. Better than my mom's, even. Which is what I told him too. I guess from that point on it became his go-to act of service, because every single day when we're together he asks me if I want children's coffee, sometimes more than once a day too. Every time I say yes, because I can tell it makes him happy to make the coffees. But here's the problem: his recipe tastes HORRIBLE with almond milk. At least the almond milk we have at my parents' house. My mom does not want soy milk in her house because of the estrogen, so this substitute is the only thing my bf could use for the coffee, but man it tastes bad. I'm talking \"the flavor gives me a nauseated feeling if I drink more than half of it\" kind of bad. Still, every time he prepares it for me in the morning, I force myself to drink it all. I've asked him to switch up the recipe a bit to accommodate for the different milk substitute, but it's like no matter what he does, each time it ends up tasting worse. But whenever he hands me that coffee mug with a proud smile on his face it's like he just handed me a cup of love, how could I not drink that? There are many ways to get out of this situation. I am not afraid of being honest. I could easily tell him it just doesn't taste good with almond milk and he will not get upset. But I don't want to. I don't want him to stop doing this. It's almost like the bad flavor makes it better/sweeter? Sometimes I even consider asking him myself if he wants to make me that coffee, knowing it will taste bad. I guess that's just how love works."},

For example, your best friend vs your romantic partner, you love both of them but other than (presumably) also being sexually attracted to your partner and not to your friend (would also appreciate if anyone has advice on what that actually means, is it literally looking at someone and having a desire to have sex with them?), is there a difference in how you feel about them? I feel like there has to be since I know that there are plenty of asexual people or people who just otherwise aren't interested in sex who still fall in love and differentiate between romantic and platonic relationships, so clearly being \"in love\" with someone is different than just loving them.

We had unashamed conversations of marriage, children, homes, issues, exes, strengths, weaknesses and just what life would be like together. It felt so right, but not in a rose colored glasses way, in a very raw and vulnerable way. One night we were at my house and we were drinking a little bit of wine, we went out to look at the stars and have a little smoke. We were in the middle of a silly conversation and he did a totally random 180 to ask me about what kind of tree growth my woods were (he works in forestry!). I laughed so hard and let the I love you I had been holding on the tip of my tongue for weeks slip. He just laughed along with me and the night continued without mention of what I said. The next day rolls around and this part of the story gets a little confusing but I‚Äôll give the short version. Basically I had a friend who was friends with my partners ex girlfriend. That friend (m) liked to tell me(f) all the negative details of my partners past relationship. I hear another story from this friend and shoot my partner a text. (just to clarify we had been openly communicating about his previous relationship from day one prior to my friends input, as well as all of my previous relationships). I tell him that i heard more from my friend and would like to talk. He comes right over even though i was just expecting a phone call. After we talked everything through we go outside again to let the dogs out. He starts apologizing for putting me through all of this drama because he knows it‚Äôs not really enjoyable for anyone involved. We talk a bit more and I just tell him that it‚Äôs okay, and I trust him, and that our relationship is what we make it and these things don‚Äôt have to influence us negatively, they can build us up. He says ‚ÄúI think I love you.‚Äù, and I tell him that ‚ÄúI know I love you.‚Äù‚Ä¶. A day or two later we‚Äôre talking about it and HE NEVER HEARD MY I LOVE YOU FROM THE PREVIOUS NIGHT!!! He thought he was saying it first and I thought I had said it first. I just find that to be the cutest thing. Neither of us were afraid of taking that first step.

I don‚Äôt think i could live life without him anymore; if something were to happen i‚Äôd hope we could remain friends.:)ü´∂"},

I did the dishes after dinner and I apparently had to take the trash out asap .  I was over his attitude mostly. It hit me the wrong way , and then my bf ... I wanted to see him . I offered to get dinner and drinks and I didn't get a response till later on . It was too late to go out with him bc my dad was also making dinner at the time . I was just over the whole day , and I was still exhausted.  I got to see my bf today for lunch on his break , and it was nice . Last night I just bawled.  I bawled like a baby , bc I was over the wedding stuff , my ex husband didn't want to do a huge thing for us getting married, and I guess again grieving in a way .

It wasn't until I was 25 when I finally decided to put myself out there as I really wanted to experience being in love as I had never experienced it. I eventually caved and downloaded Tinder and literally within 2 weeks I had met my amazing partner and went on our first date and a week later we were officially a couple. It was completely out of character for me to go so quickly into a relationship but it just felt natural and it was one of those things where it just felt right to take the chance. We've now been together for a year and a half and I definitely can say I found my person. We not only have similar interests but we get along so well and really understand each other. He does everything he can to make sure I'm happy in the relationship and occasionally asks if there's any issues or concerns I have. He does little things for me like take out the trash, surprise me with little things like Starbucks, or offers to get me food delivered if I'm not feeling well. He also took me to his home country and I got to meet his family and I just felt so welcomed and it was so nice to see where he grew up. I never thought l'd love someone so much that I'm willing to spend a little time everyday learning a new language. It literally feels like I won the lottery with this man as I can't believe that not only was he single when I met him but that he chose me out everyone else.

I‚Äôve finished chemo 2 1/2 months ago, and I‚Äôve just now started to look a bit more like a human being, lol. Seeing how I looked over the past few months breaks my heart, honestly. I wasn‚Äôt doing too bad physically all things considered, but holy shit, I looked like I was from a different species at times. Deep bags under my eyes, blue lips, yellow skin, bald, eyebrows gone‚Ä¶ picture a naked mole rat on the brink of death and yeah, that‚Äôs exactly what I looked like at times. And yet, my boyfriend constantly made me feel like the sun shined out of my bald ass. Frankly speaking, I have no idea how we have managed to have an active sex life while I was going through treatment, but he didn‚Äôt make it look difficult at all. Mind you, this is not a long relationship: I am 23, he‚Äôs 25, and we‚Äôve been together for just a bit over 6 months now. We‚Äôve met while I was going through treatment: I never would‚Äôve started a relationship in those circumstances, but he made it seem like the easiest, most natural thing. He has known about my condition from the very start, and he has never been intimidated by it. If anything, I feel like it makes him love me even more. My last boyfriend broke up with me due to cancer, so this is such a huge deal for me. He takes care of me with such kindness and patience, I don‚Äôt know how he does it. He has never made me feel like a burden in the slightest. Whenever I feel bad, either physically or mentally, he just showers me with a seemingly infinite supply of love and care. I can‚Äôt believe I am lucky enough to have someone like him in my life. Staying alive is so hard at times, but it becomes easy when I think of those in my life who want me to stay alive. If my cancer ever recurs, I‚Äôll take any treatment with a smile on my face for more time with those I love, him especially. With how hard it‚Äôs been at times, I feel like staying alive and sane is the biggest act of love I have to give. I didn‚Äôt think men like him existed, especially after my last boyfriend - but they do. If any of you reading this ever feel like you‚Äôre too much for anyone to love, take me as living (for now, LOL) proof that there‚Äôs someone out there for you.

I just moved here and was feeling a bit nostalgic, so I decided to check out a few local restaurants to ask about job openings. I figured finding something to do at night a party from my day job would help me settle in. After a few stops, I found this place called Le Colonial, which is a cool mix of Vietnamese and French cuisine. It really caught my eye. Inside, I met someone who really stood out. The manager‚Äîa young blonde with the most striking blue eyes I‚Äôve ever seen‚Äîinitially threw me off because I thought she was the hostess! After a quick chat, I left, but I couldn't stop thinking about her. So, 15 to 20 minutes later, I walked back in, pretending I needed a business card, but honestly, I just wanted to see her again and ask her out. When I asked her out, she seemed pleasantly surprised and genuinely happy, even though she mentioned she had a boyfriend. Her warm smile didn‚Äôt stop me. I took the business card, smiled back, and hinted that I‚Äôd be back. Boyfriend or not, I felt a connection I couldn't ignore. Hopefully, she‚Äôs not getting married anytime soon! I forgot to ask her name and it wasn‚Äôt on the card since she wasn‚Äôt the general manager, but I‚Äôll make sure to remember it next time. Those eyes are hard to forget!

One day while my bf and I were at my parents' house, I asked my mom to make me this \"children's coffee\" and my boyfriend asked me what that was and I explained the story behind it and how I used to drink it a lot when I was younger. That's where it all began. Ffw a few weeks, we're at his mom's house and for a change there's soy milk in the fridge there (leftover from a family holiday we went on) so he asks me if I want children's coffee. Surprised, I asked him if he wanted to make it for me and he said yes. So obviously I agreed, it's a cute gesture. And it was good. Better than my mom's, even. Which is what I told him too. I guess from that point on it became his go-to act of service, because every single day when we're together he asks me if I want children's coffee, sometimes more than once a day too. Every time I say yes, because I can tell it makes him happy to make the coffees. But here's the problem: his recipe tastes HORRIBLE with almond milk. At least the almond milk we have at my parents' house. My mom does not want soy milk in her house because of the estrogen, so this substitute is the only thing my bf could use for the coffee, but man it tastes bad. I'm talking \"the flavor gives me a nauseated feeling if I drink more than half of it\" kind of bad. Still, every time he prepares it for me in the morning, I force myself to drink it all. I've asked him to switch up the recipe a bit to accommodate for the different milk substitute, but it's like no matter what he does, each time it ends up tasting worse. But whenever he hands me that coffee mug with a proud smile on his face it's like he just handed me a cup of love, how could I not drink that? There are many ways to get out of this situation. I am not afraid of being honest. I could easily tell him it just doesn't taste good with almond milk and he will not get upset. But I don't want to. I don't want him to stop doing this. It's almost like the bad flavor makes it better/sweeter? Sometimes I even consider asking him myself if he wants to make me that coffee, knowing it will taste bad.

For example, your best friend vs your romantic partner, you love both of them but other than (presumably) also being sexually attracted to your partner and not to your friend (would also appreciate if anyone has advice on what that actually means, is it literally looking at someone and having a desire to have sex with them?), is there a difference in how you feel about them? I feel like there has to be since I know that there are plenty of asexual people or people who just otherwise aren't interested in sex who still fall in love and differentiate between romantic and platonic relationships, so clearly being \"in love\" with someone is different than just loving them.

I went back to school and didn't date so I wasn't distracted. At 32 I graduated and promised myself I'd start dating because lonleyness was starting to bring me real down. I went on a dating app and met this guy. He was the first one I went on a date with and now 8 months later we still text everyday about he asked me to move in in 2 months. I'm so in love and I just want to talk and write about to somewhere. I love this man, I'm so in love with how he treats me and the things he does and says. He is just the best. The company is wonderful. The sex is the best its ever been. He treats me so amazingly and does such nice things for me. I always told myself that I had my one great love in my life already and that I was lucky to have that and didn't think I'd have love again.  But wow. Its so much better. Its amazing. I wish there was bigger words then I love you that I could tell him. I'm so happy in life right now that while I'm traveling for a bridesmaids party and my heart feel sick trying to fall asleep so far away from him. I hate it. I wish there was some way to turn off the love sickness. I can't wait to see him again."},

She even decided to name me her best man (or man of honor) whenever she gets married.  That's honestly one of the greatest honors to be given and I appreciate it a great deal.  I still love her to this day, at least as a person (not romantically, but platonically).  I learned she was my platonic soulmate since December 2023, though did take me time to confirm it and share with her. I have made many friends online, but this one in particular is unlike any other I have made.  The fact I learned she is my platonic soulmate makes it more special.  Even though I know how to find my own happiness; it's great to have someone be a special addition like her.  It's incredible to know someone who thinks on a very similar wavelength, able to connect very quickly, very similar values, etc.  Again, I appreciate her a great deal. ü•∞ If you have one or more platonic soulmates you truly appreciate, feel free to share. üòâ"},

During the most recent failed relationship, I told myself that at 30, I had to settle for a less-than-ideal relationship, because I had already experienced one relationship with a man who was head over heels for me. In my early 30s, I‚Äôm in a relationship where I feel secure and where my partner regularly approves he genuinely adores me. Nothing was forced, everything progressed naturally. I‚Äôm a more mature and emotionally independent person than I was when I was engaged; that relationship was doomed to fail because of my own immaturity, toxicity and codependence, but that doesn‚Äôt mean what I experienced then wasn‚Äôt true love, nor does it detract from the love I‚Äôm experiencing now.

Sunday I was exhausted after getting home after it , swollen feet , and sleep deprived . Monday became a Monday for no reason, and it hit like a tidal wave .  I cleaned my car out and vacuumed it out . My dad was being annoying bc he just had to see how good of a job I did on my own car . He wanted to \" Inspect \" it . I said no your not seeing the inside of my car , I bought it and pay for it . He returned with being petty and on my case about stuff . I asked him where I could get my state inspection done , he wasn't a help . Every Monday is trash day .... he is an odd ball about it . I did the dishes after dinner and I apparently had to take the trash out asap .  I was over his attitude mostly. It hit me the wrong way , and then my bf ... I wanted to see him . I offered to get dinner and drinks and I didn't get a response till later on . It was too late to go out with him bc my dad was also making dinner at the time . I was just over the whole day , and I was still exhausted.  I got to see my bf today for lunch on his break , and it was nice . Last night I just bawled.  I bawled like a baby , bc I was over the wedding stuff , my ex husband didn't want to do a huge thing for us getting married, and I guess again grieving in a way . Grieving bc I didn't have a big wedding, grieving bc of a lot back then.  I'm not sure if it was any sort of a trigger , but damn it.  My bf called me tonight like usual , and he is making me dinner , washed the bed sheets and wants to go to the beach for sunset tomorrow . I mentioned that I see him once a week , and it kills me . He offered to spend time with me this weekend as well,  and tomorrow night.  Sometimes , I forget that I have someone who actually cares and loves me . I felt a disconnect from him, but I over think . My gut feelings weren't screaming,  just my heart was aching . I really was sad and mad at the world . I tried to call my bestie , bc she usually helps me figure shit out . I think I understand why I was upset and what I needed.  Long story short , I feel better and get to be spoiled tomorrow night .

This other friend also knew of him, he said ‚Äúhe had a healthy relationship with with his ex, but (my name) has only been in toxic relationships‚Äù it made me feel that most people think I‚Äôm at fault for being abused in relationships. I feel relieved that I‚Äôll be in a healthy relationship and won‚Äôt be victim blamed or villainised for the abuse I‚Äôve endured, this will be the relationship that maybe will wake people up that I‚Äôm not the problem other than condoning it for too long. I feel so lucky to have found such a loving kind person after living a lifetime with the opposite. üôè"},

I eventually caved and downloaded Tinder and literally within 2 weeks I had met my amazing partner and went on our first date and a week later we were officially a couple. It was completely out of character for me to go so quickly into a relationship but it just felt natural and it was one of those things where it just felt right to take the chance. We've now been together for a year and a half and I definitely can say I found my person. We not only have similar interests but we get along so well and really understand each other. He does everything he can to make sure I'm happy in the relationship and occasionally asks if there's any issues or concerns I have. He does little things for me like take out the trash, surprise me with little things like Starbucks, or offers to get me food delivered if I'm not feeling well. He also took me to his home country and I got to meet his family and I just felt so welcomed and it was so nice to see where he grew up. I never thought l'd love someone so much that I'm willing to spend a little time everyday learning a new language. It literally feels like I won the lottery with this man as I can't believe that not only was he single when I met him but that he chose me out everyone else.

Until I met my husband. From the start he just‚Ä¶ loved me. I was a mess back then and I tested him a lot, but he always passed with flying colors. When I asked him if he knew he was being tested he said yes, but that he understood because of everything I had been through. We‚Äôd spend hours over the weekends in bed just snuggling until I was overstimulated which was never a thing because no one ever wanted to do that with me. 8 years later it‚Äôs still the same, we can spend all day happily hanging out in bed and just getting up for food and to pee, which is our plan for this Sunday. Sometimes my insecurities from the past creep up and last night I asked him, ‚ÄúAren‚Äôt I too much sometimes?‚Äù He responded, ‚ÄúNo. What do you mean?‚Äù And I reminded him that even I know I can still be way intense, energetic, and physically and emotionally needy sometimes and he said, ‚ÄúWell that‚Äôs you and I just love you. I don‚Äôt have to think about it harder than that.‚Äù This morning while he was working I sent him a joke video about getting me baby Highlander cows for Valentine‚Äôs Day. Within 15 minutes he sent me info about a farm an hour away that offers private tours to feed and snuggle baby cows. I never knew this was a thing and we‚Äôve set a date to go. I love this man so much, and I still find it so weird that he just loves me and I don‚Äôt have to play games or pretend to be anyone else. I do try to hold myself back when I know he needs time alone as we are both pretty introverted, but if ever I feel disconnected from him I just say so and he will open his arms without hesitation so I can jump in. The only time I can‚Äôt do that is when he is in a meeting lol. I don‚Äôt know how I got this lucky. Edit: thanks for the love everyone üíï"},

One of my symptoms is hand washing (long, long before the pandemic started‚ÄîI‚Äôm talking 10+ years). I wash my hands constantly to the point where they get red, dry, and the skin starts cracking. I use lotion when it gets bad but it usually doesn‚Äôt work, sometimes it provides temporary relief but I‚Äôve pretty much accepted that my hands will always be like this. The effects on my skin are usually worse in the wintertime, but people ask me all the time why my hands are so red and why they‚Äôre so dry and I absolutely hate it. I struggle with this everyday, the compulsions of ‚Äúif I don‚Äôt wash my hands right now, something bad will happen‚Äù and it‚Äôs not really an easy thing to explain to people because a lot of people see OCD as something they can just diagnose themselves because they ‚Äúlike to keep things organized‚Äù I could go on and on about my problem with that statement, as someone who struggles with OCD everyday‚Äîbut that‚Äôs not where I‚Äôm here. Last night me and my girlfriend (F21) were just chilling at my house and my mom made a comment about how she could tell I had been home because we were running out of soap. She and my sister were talking loudly about it, and my girlfriend and I exchanged looks but neither of us said anything. I think she could tell I was a little bothered so she asked what was wrong, and I told her I was tired of hearing about how much soap I use, and that I couldn‚Äôt control it (washing my hands so much). She immediately said ‚ÄúI know, I know‚Äù and grabbed my arm, listening as I told her I couldn‚Äôt control it and how I don‚Äôt exactly remember when or how it started but it‚Äôd been that way for years, and I was about to thank her for never making me feel bad for it when she looked at me and said just that: ‚ÄúI will never make you feel bad for it babe, and I will always make sure you have all the soap in the world and never run out. Plus, I get a discount on it at my store, so it‚Äôs okay.‚Äù I wanted to cry hearing those words come out of her mouth before I even had the chance to say anything. This isn‚Äôt the first time she‚Äôs said something that‚Äôs validated my OCD; she‚Äôs made comments here and there before and is completely unbothered by it. I never thought I‚Äôd find someone who is so accepting of a mental disorder that isn‚Äôt always easy to understand. She‚Äôs never once made me feel bad for it and has always accepted me as I am. It‚Äôs not an easy battle fighting OCD like this every single day. There‚Äôs also many other factors to it that often feel debilitating and smothering. But to know that she doesn‚Äôt mind, that she can understand something she‚Äôs never had to experience before, that she loves me regardless and chooses not to make me feel bad for something I have no control over‚Äîit made me love her even more. I‚Äôm so thankful to have found this, I‚Äôm so thankful that she‚Äôs never made it a big deal. She even buys big containers of soap so it‚Äôll last us longer. Anyways, just wanted to tell someone this. It made me feel so validated and loved in that moment‚Äîespecially when she said that right as I was about to thank her for never making me feel bad about it. I‚Äôm a very lucky guy, and it was just one of those things that made me realize that. Edit: wow thank you guys so much for the love! I promise I will reply to every one of your comments!! Just wanted to leave this here so y‚Äôall know I‚Äôve read every one of them and I appreciate your kind words, and I will respond to all of you when I can!! ‚ù§Ô∏è Edit: sooooo last night my girlfriend found my post (she uses Reddit as well) and got SO excited and said, ‚Äúoh my god!!

And i just went for it. It was nothing more than a lingering peck really. But that's what was perfect about it. It was dark so the nerves were subsided a bit. And it was just us which was even better to me. It was just so innocent and sweet. And that's all I wanted for my first kiss. And he perfectly punctuated it by saying, I love you.

We sat like that the whole way to my house. And his parents aren't the type to point out affection like so many seem to do. So it was casual. But it was everything.

He‚Äôs one of those dads who‚Äôs always making corny jokes and is just the sweetest guy. He came up to us and jokingly asked me ‚ÄúYou know you can do better than this guy, don‚Äôt you?‚Äù I told him I didn‚Äôt think I could. Later in the evening when my boyfriend went to get us drinks I was sitting with his parents. His mom said ‚ÄúSo. You and Robbie, huh?‚Äù She always calls him Robbie and he hates it. I said ‚ÄúYeah, I think he‚Äôs just the greatest.‚Äù Or something like that. She told me she thinks it‚Äôs adorable that we got together and that we make the cutest couple.

You didn't choose to be an over thinker. You wish you didn't have to re-read or take a second to think about what they said. Their words never seem to come out as hurtful but to you, the over thinker ; they are and they always will be. You try your best not to over analyze the things they say but it never works. You take what is said and make the worst of it. When something of minor inconvenience takes hold, it isn't just minor anymore. It engulfs your entire mind to the point where you are overthinking everything. Every Last Thing . You start to question everything about the relationship. You let your emotions take over and conquer you. You‚Äôre worried, aren't you? You‚Äôre worried that one day your overthinking will be too much and they will leave just like everyone else, right? You don‚Äôt mean to be clingy . You don't want to become a burden that you think you‚Äôre becoming to them. So what do you do? You overthink . You doubt their love for you is as strong as yours. How could they love you the same? As an over thinker you question everything. You‚Äôre worried about them wanting to be with someone else like when they take too long to respond. ‚Äú They must have found someone else‚Äù . As a result; you respond right away because you've been waiting for their response for hours.. You assume that they were talking to someone better. Your mind takes you into a state of emergency of overthinking. Telling you only the wrong things you don't need to hear. When they‚Äôre too busy to see you, it auto corrects in your mind as ‚Äúthey do not want to see me‚Äù. Any simple texts can turn into a roller coaster full of over thinking emotions. Now from everything i've addressed.. Forget about it and take a minute to process what i‚Äôm about to say. Don‚Äôt go back and re-read what they said.. You have nothing to worry about. Do not doubt their love for you, that hurts their feelings. They just have different ways of showing love than you do.You are not a burden to them, they just have a busy life on top of your relationship. They do love you as much as you do. They haven't responded in a while? Be patient, they want to talk to you they are just busy. When they are too busy to see you, don't take it personally; understand that they will make time when they can. They are trying. So try to understand from their point of view as well. So please do not overthink about your relationship, it isn't healthy for you or your partner. How do I know this? Because I have felt the same things.. I have been anxious about not getting a text back in a certain amount of time. I have thought they didn‚Äôt love me anymore because of little things they say. But with that being said, I'm learning (have learned) to not let it control me as much as it used to‚Ä¶ Just remember Everything will be okay, just breathe.

I wasn‚Äôt doing too bad physically all things considered, but holy shit, I looked like I was from a different species at times. Deep bags under my eyes, blue lips, yellow skin, bald, eyebrows gone‚Ä¶ picture a naked mole rat on the brink of death and yeah, that‚Äôs exactly what I looked like at times. And yet, my boyfriend constantly made me feel like the sun shined out of my bald ass. Frankly speaking, I have no idea how we have managed to have an active sex life while I was going through treatment, but he didn‚Äôt make it look difficult at all. Mind you, this is not a long relationship: I am 23, he‚Äôs 25, and we‚Äôve been together for just a bit over 6 months now. We‚Äôve met while I was going through treatment: I never would‚Äôve started a relationship in those circumstances, but he made it seem like the easiest, most natural thing. He has known about my condition from the very start, and he has never been intimidated by it. If anything, I feel like it makes him love me even more. My last boyfriend broke up with me due to cancer, so this is such a huge deal for me. He takes care of me with such kindness and patience, I don‚Äôt know how he does it. He has never made me feel like a burden in the slightest. Whenever I feel bad, either physically or mentally, he just showers me with a seemingly infinite supply of love and care. I can‚Äôt believe I am lucky enough to have someone like him in my life. Staying alive is so hard at times, but it becomes easy when I think of those in my life who want me to stay alive. If my cancer ever recurs, I‚Äôll take any treatment with a smile on my face for more time with those I love, him especially. With how hard it‚Äôs been at times, I feel like staying alive and sane is the biggest act of love I have to give. I didn‚Äôt think men like him existed, especially after my last boyfriend - but they do.

One day while my bf and I were at my parents' house, I asked my mom to make me this \"children's coffee\" and my boyfriend asked me what that was and I explained the story behind it and how I used to drink it a lot when I was younger. That's where it all began. Ffw a few weeks, we're at his mom's house and for a change there's soy milk in the fridge there (leftover from a family holiday we went on) so he asks me if I want children's coffee. Surprised, I asked him if he wanted to make it for me and he said yes. So obviously I agreed, it's a cute gesture. And it was good. Better than my mom's, even. Which is what I told him too. I guess from that point on it became his go-to act of service, because every single day when we're together he asks me if I want children's coffee, sometimes more than once a day too. Every time I say yes, because I can tell it makes him happy to make the coffees. But here's the problem: his recipe tastes HORRIBLE with almond milk. At least the almond milk we have at my parents' house. My mom does not want soy milk in her house because of the estrogen, so this substitute is the only thing my bf could use for the coffee, but man it tastes bad. I'm talking \"the flavor gives me a nauseated feeling if I drink more than half of it\" kind of bad. Still, every time he prepares it for me in the morning, I force myself to drink it all. I've asked him to switch up the recipe a bit to accommodate for the different milk substitute, but it's like no matter what he does, each time it ends up tasting worse. But whenever he hands me that coffee mug with a proud smile on his face it's like he just handed me a cup of love, how could I not drink that? There are many ways to get out of this situation. I am not afraid of being honest. I could easily tell him it just doesn't taste good with almond milk and he will not get upset. But I don't want to. I don't want him to stop doing this. It's almost like the bad flavor makes it better/sweeter? Sometimes I even consider asking him myself if he wants to make me that coffee, knowing it will taste bad. I guess that's just how love works."},

For example, your best friend vs your romantic partner, you love both of them but other than (presumably) also being sexually attracted to your partner and not to your friend (would also appreciate if anyone has advice on what that actually means, is it literally looking at someone and having a desire to have sex with them?), is there a difference in how you feel about them?

We hadn‚Äôt been together for very long, just a couple months, but we both knew it was very different from anything else we had experienced. We had unashamed conversations of marriage, children, homes, issues, exes, strengths, weaknesses and just what life would be like together. It felt so right, but not in a rose colored glasses way, in a very raw and vulnerable way. One night we were at my house and we were drinking a little bit of wine, we went out to look at the stars and have a little smoke. We were in the middle of a silly conversation and he did a totally random 180 to ask me about what kind of tree growth my woods were (he works in forestry!). I laughed so hard and let the I love you I had been holding on the tip of my tongue for weeks slip. He just laughed along with me and the night continued without mention of what I said. The next day rolls around and this part of the story gets a little confusing but I‚Äôll give the short version. Basically I had a friend who was friends with my partners ex girlfriend. That friend (m) liked to tell me(f) all the negative details of my partners past relationship. I hear another story from this friend and shoot my partner a text. (just to clarify we had been openly communicating about his previous relationship from day one prior to my friends input, as well as all of my previous relationships). I tell him that i heard more from my friend and would like to talk. He comes right over even though i was just expecting a phone call. After we talked everything through we go outside again to let the dogs out. He starts apologizing for putting me through all of this drama because he knows it‚Äôs not really enjoyable for anyone involved. We talk a bit more and I just tell him that it‚Äôs okay, and I trust him, and that our relationship is what we make it and these things don‚Äôt have to influence us negatively, they can build us up. He says ‚ÄúI think I love you.‚Äù, and I tell him that ‚ÄúI know I love you.‚Äù‚Ä¶. A day or two later we‚Äôre talking about it and HE NEVER HEARD MY I LOVE YOU FROM THE PREVIOUS NIGHT!!! He thought he was saying it first and I thought I had said it first. I just find that to be the cutest thing. Neither of us were afraid of taking that first step. Everything was perfectly balanced and it makes me feel incredibly happy to think about. He is my person. Thank you for reading‚ô•Ô∏è"},

I just moved here and was feeling a bit nostalgic, so I decided to check out a few local restaurants to ask about job openings. I figured finding something to do at night a party from my day job would help me settle in. After a few stops, I found this place called Le Colonial, which is a cool mix of Vietnamese and French cuisine. It really caught my eye. Inside, I met someone who really stood out. The manager‚Äîa young blonde with the most striking blue eyes I‚Äôve ever seen‚Äîinitially threw me off because I thought she was the hostess! After a quick chat, I left, but I couldn't stop thinking about her. So, 15 to 20 minutes later, I walked back in, pretending I needed a business card, but honestly, I just wanted to see her again and ask her out. When I asked her out, she seemed pleasantly surprised and genuinely happy, even though she mentioned she had a boyfriend. Her warm smile didn‚Äôt stop me. I took the business card, smiled back, and hinted that I‚Äôd be back. Boyfriend or not, I felt a connection I couldn't ignore. Hopefully, she‚Äôs not getting married anytime soon! I forgot to ask her name and it wasn‚Äôt on the card since she wasn‚Äôt the general manager, but I‚Äôll make sure to remember it next time. Those eyes are hard to forget!

When you feel sad, I will comfort you. When you feel alone, I will be present. Your happiness will be my happiness. Your pleasure will be my pleasure. Your pain will be my pain. Your grief will be my grief. Your anger will be my anger. Your triumphs will be my triumphs. Your sadness will be my sadness. Your enemies will be my enemies. Your friends will be my friends. Your family will be my family. I will worship your mind, your heart, your soul, and every inch of your body. And I will serve you second to only the almighty God. And on I read, Until the day was gone, And I sat in regret, Of all the things I've done, For all that I've blessed, And all that I've wronged, In dreams until my death, I will wander on, In your house, I long to be, Room by room, patiently, I'll wait for you there, Like a stone, I'll wait for you there, Alone, Alone."},

I have given more of myself to you than I have to anybody else in my entire life. You could have just told me you needed a breather, I would have been fine. I just want you. I want to get close to you. You said I was beautiful, that you wanted me, that you loved being with me.  You call me sweetie and hold my hand, you took a day off work to spend time with me.

Sunday I was exhausted after getting home after it , swollen feet , and sleep deprived . Monday became a Monday for no reason, and it hit like a tidal wave .  I cleaned my car out and vacuumed it out . My dad was being annoying bc he just had to see how good of a job I did on my own car . He wanted to \" Inspect \" it . I said no your not seeing the inside of my car , I bought it and pay for it . He returned with being petty and on my case about stuff .

I did the dishes after dinner and I apparently had to take the trash out asap .  I was over his attitude mostly. It hit me the wrong way , and then my bf ... I wanted to see him . I offered to get dinner and drinks and I didn't get a response till later on . It was too late to go out with him bc my dad was also making dinner at the time . I was just over the whole day , and I was still exhausted.  I got to see my bf today for lunch on his break , and it was nice . Last night I just bawled.  I bawled like a baby , bc I was over the wedding stuff , my ex husband didn't want to do a huge thing for us getting married, and I guess again grieving in a way . Grieving bc I didn't have a big wedding, grieving bc of a lot back then.  I'm not sure if it was any sort of a trigger , but damn it.

He offered to spend time with me this weekend as well,  and tomorrow night.  Sometimes , I forget that I have someone who actually cares and loves me . I felt a disconnect from him, but I over think . My gut feelings weren't screaming,  just my heart was aching . I really was sad and mad at the world .

You have fun with him while I keep dreaming of you at night. In my dreams I can see you, talk with you, hug you, lay on a bed with you. Everything feels better. Then I wake up, and everything feels worse than before. I begin asking myself, why should I even get up from bed and work? Yeah, for myself. To keep my life going.

I definitely wasn‚Äôt going to just sit there and let him do things like that, to me or to himself. I wasn‚Äôt going to be an enabler and I wasn‚Äôt going to tie myself to that. So I took him and sat him down. And I explained that I knew he was recovering from a serious addiction and because of that I was going to forgive him for what had happened. And I also explained that I would give him two years. I wouldn‚Äôt commit to anything serious in that time, but if he could stay completely clean and sober it would show me that he was serious about our relationship. And to show him I was just as serious, I said that if he could do that, I would marry him. Now, four years later, he‚Äôs still completely sober and we‚Äôre engaged and I can say without a doubt that giving him a second chance that night was absolutely the best decision I have ever made. He is the love of my life. He never hesitates to tell me how beautiful I am or how much he loves me, and when I‚Äôm feeling bad he always does everything he possibly can to make me feel better. He is my world."},

I met my partner two months later. My partner is the love of my life -- the best man I've ever met. We fell in love within two or three weeks of meeting, and our love continues to grow. He is an amazing partner! He shows his love in ways I never dreamed possible (including bringing me breakfast in bed a couple of times a week). Tonight we were working here in the study. We each have a computer in here, and there is also a bed for napping. Just before I moved here two months ago, he set up Apple Home using Siri. One of Siri's skills is to play music all over the house when we ask her to. As we are both working at our computers, listening to music, the song \"In the Arms of the Angels\" starts to play. My wonderful, loving partner knew that song would trigger intense grief in me and make me cry. As soon as it started playing, he stood up, came to my computer, put his arms around me and said, \"Come on, let's go snuggle.\" I was already crying. My partner led me to the bed, pulled me into his arms, told Siri to stop the music, held me, and talked to me about my son until I stopped crying. I have never felt so loved. I love this man more than he can imagine. I know without a doubt that he feels the same."},
{"Title": "I find emotional intimacy difficult in many ways. Many people seem to want to hide who they are.", "Author": "u/Objective-Candle3478", "Content": "I do get the feeling that nowadays what leads to a big issue with relationships is, on one hand so many people just want to be loved for who they truly are. But then on the other those very same individuals get too scared/timid to actually let others in on real emotionally intimate level. How can someone be loved unconditionally if they don't show who they truly are to others? When I say this I mean, their fears, insecurities, and doubts in the moment as well as the positives. So many go out their way to protect their own ego that they hurt those willing to want to love them for who they are. I do think a lot is because of issues with perfectionism and what it means to be attractive. It's scary to actually put yourself truly on the line like that. But by doing so makes you a fantasticaslly strong individual. To accept and understand that you are a perfectly imperfect individual takes a lot of strength, and through that strength is being vulnerable you can have a chance at unconditional love. What are your thoughts?"},
{"Title": "For 30 Years, I loved with contempt. My ex wife despised me.", "Author": "u/saffermaster", "Content": "After a few years licking my wounds, I put myself out there at age 55, trying to find love. I spent 4 years enjoying kinky sex with women of every age. From 18 to 60. Nothing I did could fill the emptiness I felt in my broken heart. One woman I dated shared with me that in spite of my sense of failure, that she found me imminently lovable. Another lover told me that I am too distant and \"You need to let me in,\" I went out and got a tattoo on my chest that took 7 months to complete. It captured my sense that attraction was possible, that there was a certain randomity to the world, that we lived in an endless universe and that I am lovable. Its a cool trash punk tattoo. I looked hard at what was missing from my marriage. It occurred to me that intimacy was missing. One day I got a message from a woman on a kink site who saw my \"seeking post\". She was as kinky as me and also looking for intimacy and we started a dialogue. We courted for 6 months before we began our dynamic formally. That was 6 years ago. in 6 days I am going to marry her. I could not be happier. We not only found love, we fell in love and have had a steamy love affair that goes on and on. I am so here for it. Its possible to find love. I can guarantee that there is love after divorce. My life is poetry. Update: Kink is interesting. People of all ages participate. There are kids who learn about kink at a very young age, and are perhaps more ready to explore kink when they get to age 18 than others are till much later in life. One thing about being Dom in a kink setting like a club or munch is that submissives of all ages and genders approach you and negotiate a scene with you. Remember, all kink is based on consent, not persuasion, informed enthusiastic consent. I should have noted that I practice RACK which is Risk-Aware Consensual Kink, and SSC, Safe, Sane Consensual Kink. I get the idea that morality has it that young adults should not play with old adults, but that is simply your own ick, nobody else's. We have a saying in kink, \"I'm not going to yuck on your yum\""},

I look at the casual photos I love taking of her and I think she‚Äôs so sexy, so inspiring, so beautiful, and so intelligent. She‚Äôs off the radar bro. She‚Äôs crazy to think she‚Äôs ugly if she really believes that. I seriously love this women. I love to see her laugh. I love when it‚Äôs me making her laugh. I love the way she walks. I even love when she‚Äôs nagging, I don‚Äôt mean it in any disrespectful way. For example, when she tries to convince me to take cab home instead of walking home at night and she‚Äôs super serious but I still decide to walk home, because overall I live like 15 blocks away lol. I love her nose. I love her big eyes. I love her hair. I love her forehead. I love the smudged oval  birthmark on the right side of her face. I love when shes eating. I love her fingernails. I love her toes. I love her belly. I love her family to because they are good people. I love when the hairs on her legs are growing. I love her kisses when she use to give me some. I super love her hugs and when it lasts for more than 10 seconds. I love her style. I love her charisma. I love how funny she is. I love her principles. I love her dog. I literally can go on and on. I love how she just a boss. I love her being anal about having matching sheets. I love how she‚Äôs always trying to evolve. From upgrading her standard toothbrush to an electric one üò≠ or just taking care of herself and her needs. Shit I love she broke up with me because I totally respect that and respect her. At this point, i think I can care less if she gets back with me. It would hurt, yes, if she decided to move on entirely and we don‚Äôt talk anymore but part of me is just so grateful to be in her presence still and show her, even though we are friends, how much I still appreciate her. I can never convince myself things I hate about her. I‚Äôm here for her until whenever. I won‚Äôt let her go. I wish I was Superman and I could sweep her off her feet and fly her out of earth and show her the stars and planets. I will try my best to show it every chance I get to show and prove to her. I Need to use my brain and show her it‚Äôs more than the dates, the past sex, etc. I really can‚Äôt explain it but I just love the time she gives me, the care she had for me, everything yo.

We made our relationship official in April, so I like to think we took it pretty slow. In every other relationship I have ever had, I felt the need to be so careful about my body, my choices, and never felt at home with my partners. I always was waiting for the next step of where I was going to go to next. I made sure that we used multiple forms of protection when we were intimate. I never felt like I could be my sensitive, extroverted self fully. Before we became romantic, he helped me pass the final course I needed for my first degree. I had been calling my \"Rave Husband\", because we were always attached at the hip at the many raves we stuffed into a year. He spent the day with me after I had emergency surgery, just so I wouldn't be alone. He is one of the only people that has ever made an effort to celebrate my birthday. He got out of his car when I did, because he thought he was going to have to pull me off of some guy in front of a bar, and still decided to want me. He watched me projectile vomit outside of a show in 100 degree weather, and left early with me, and cuddled me while I looked like a drowned sewer rat months long before he declared his feelings. With this man??? I told this man today that I trust him enough to decide when and if he ever wants to put a baby in me. I told this man that I would provide for him whatever he desires in this world and then more. I made this man know I intend on marrying him and making sure that he smiles every day for the rest of his life. I let this man do things to me today that I would have never allowed anyone else do. Suddenly, just like magic, I would give him everything I am and still be searching for more to give him. Every day, I find out more about him that makes my love grow even bigger. I sat in my bedroom for hours today waiting for him to call on his work break, in shock with myself at the words that had come out of my mouth to him before he had left. Never in my life have I been down this bad for someone. Every day it gets worse. I grieve for the time in this life that I won't get to spend with him. I have never wanted to just spend a day laying around with someone. It's like I have been possessed. Somehow, I have known my best friend for over a year now and the love I have for him only continues to grow exponentially with time that I fear I may one day explode. SOS"},

He makes me so happy.", "Author": "u/sheerest_of_folly", "Content": "I know not many people will likely care to read my rant, but I love this man so fucking much. We‚Äôve been dating for almost 3 years (anniversary in July). For 2.5 of them, we were online. Online relationships are hard. He‚Äôs in South Carolina, I was in Maryland. I decided to move to him. On the way down, on January 31st, literally 40 minutes away, my mom fell asleep at the wheel and we crashed into the moving van (she was going to drop me off, as she herself was moving to Florida with my youngest sibling. Other sibling stayed with Dad in Maryland for college.) I was the only one moderately injured in the wreck (thank God) and was taken to the hospital in an ambulance. I told my boyfriend where. He met me there. I saw my boyfriend in person for the first time while on a hospital bed. The first few months were rough for me to settle in. 21 years in Maryland in the same area my whole life was hard to transition from. My boyfriend was with me every step of the way. March was the anniversary of the deaths of several people who were important to me in my youth. They died in a car crash when I was a young teen. In Maryland, every year I would go to the playground we all played at on their deathiversary, since none of them were buried (all cremated to my knowledge). My boyfriend drove me the 500 miles to go back to Maryland to be at that playground. In April, I had a breast reduction surgery. The recovery for that was rough‚Äî for the first two weeks, I couldn‚Äôt reach my middle well enough to use the bathroom. This man wiped my pee for me, and once the anesthesia wore off, my poop too. I got my period in the second week. He learned how to put a tampon in me and take it out. He was by my side the whole time. The breast reduction was done in Maryland and we stayed with my father for a week. I‚Äôve only seen my father cry three times: when our cat died, at the end of Star Wars (because ‚Äúit‚Äôs so happy, they got the medals they worked so hard for‚Äù üíÄ), and when my boyfriend and I left. My father said he‚Äôs a good man and he‚Äôs so happy for us. He also gave him $400 to ‚Äúpay him back‚Äù for medical expenses. My boyfriend ended up using the remainder on a date with me. Speaking of dates. I love notebooks and pens; my boyfriend doesn‚Äôt really care about those. Yet he took me on a date to Staples and Michaels, I thought to window shop but he bought so much for me. He also gets me some model skulls that I collect when he sees a cool one. Shortly after I moved in, he came home with one meant for an aquarium: ‚ÄúI thought of you.‚Äù I cried. We went to MomoCon this year, and he cosplayed with me. We went as Leon and Ada from the Resident Evil series (specifically the RE4 remake). He waited in line for Digimon and Pok√©mon voice actors with me and listened to me rant about the characters I like. We‚Äôre getting married next year. We aren‚Äôt conventionally engaged yet‚Äî he has something planned but won‚Äôt tell me‚Äî but we know we‚Äôre getting married. We just haven‚Äôt told our families yet.

I wasn‚Äôt doing too bad physically all things considered, but holy shit, I looked like I was from a different species at times. Deep bags under my eyes, blue lips, yellow skin, bald, eyebrows gone‚Ä¶ picture a naked mole rat on the brink of death and yeah, that‚Äôs exactly what I looked like at times. And yet, my boyfriend constantly made me feel like the sun shined out of my bald ass. Frankly speaking, I have no idea how we have managed to have an active sex life while I was going through treatment, but he didn‚Äôt make it look difficult at all. Mind you, this is not a long relationship: I am 23, he‚Äôs 25, and we‚Äôve been together for just a bit over 6 months now. We‚Äôve met while I was going through treatment: I never would‚Äôve started a relationship in those circumstances, but he made it seem like the easiest, most natural thing. He has known about my condition from the very start, and he has never been intimidated by it. If anything, I feel like it makes him love me even more. My last boyfriend broke up with me due to cancer, so this is such a huge deal for me. He takes care of me with such kindness and patience, I don‚Äôt know how he does it. He has never made me feel like a burden in the slightest. Whenever I feel bad, either physically or mentally, he just showers me with a seemingly infinite supply of love and care. I can‚Äôt believe I am lucky enough to have someone like him in my life. Staying alive is so hard at times, but it becomes easy when I think of those in my life who want me to stay alive. If my cancer ever recurs, I‚Äôll take any treatment with a smile on my face for more time with those I love, him especially. With how hard it‚Äôs been at times, I feel like staying alive and sane is the biggest act of love I have to give. I didn‚Äôt think men like him existed, especially after my last boyfriend - but they do.

I don‚Äôt see a scenario in which that changes anytime soon. I left M for me. I‚Äôm not drinking nearly as much as I was. I have my support system in place. I‚Äôm exercising every day.

{"Title": "My girlfriend said something that made me want to cry because it was exactly what I was about to thank her for", "Author": "Unknown author", "Content": "So I (M22) have OCD, I was diagnosed at 14 but it‚Äôs something I‚Äôve struggled with my whole life. One of my symptoms is hand washing (long, long before the pandemic started‚ÄîI‚Äôm talking 10+ years). I wash my hands constantly to the point where they get red, dry, and the skin starts cracking. I use lotion when it gets bad but it usually doesn‚Äôt work, sometimes it provides temporary relief but I‚Äôve pretty much accepted that my hands will always be like this. The effects on my skin are usually worse in the wintertime, but people ask me all the time why my hands are so red and why they‚Äôre so dry and I absolutely hate it. I struggle with this everyday, the compulsions of ‚Äúif I don‚Äôt wash my hands right now, something bad will happen‚Äù and it‚Äôs not really an easy thing to explain to people because a lot of people see OCD as something they can just diagnose themselves because they ‚Äúlike to keep things organized‚Äù I could go on and on about my problem with that statement, as someone who struggles with OCD everyday‚Äîbut that‚Äôs not where I‚Äôm here. Last night me and my girlfriend (F21) were just chilling at my house and my mom made a comment about how she could tell I had been home because we were running out of soap. She and my sister were talking loudly about it, and my girlfriend and I exchanged looks but neither of us said anything. I think she could tell I was a little bothered so she asked what was wrong, and I told her I was tired of hearing about how much soap I use, and that I couldn‚Äôt control it (washing my hands so much). She immediately said ‚ÄúI know, I know‚Äù and grabbed my arm, listening as I told her I couldn‚Äôt control it and how I don‚Äôt exactly remember when or how it started but it‚Äôd been that way for years, and I was about to thank her for never making me feel bad for it when she looked at me and said just that: ‚ÄúI will never make you feel bad for it babe, and I will always make sure you have all the soap in the world and never run out. Plus, I get a discount on it at my store, so it‚Äôs okay.‚Äù I wanted to cry hearing those words come out of her mouth before I even had the chance to say anything. This isn‚Äôt the first time she‚Äôs said something that‚Äôs validated my OCD; she‚Äôs made comments here and there before and is completely unbothered by it. I never thought I‚Äôd find someone who is so accepting of a mental disorder that isn‚Äôt always easy to understand. She‚Äôs never once made me feel bad for it and has always accepted me as I am. It‚Äôs not an easy battle fighting OCD like this every single day. There‚Äôs also many other factors to it that often feel debilitating and smothering. But to know that she doesn‚Äôt mind, that she can understand something she‚Äôs never had to experience before, that she loves me regardless and chooses not to make me feel bad for something I have no control over‚Äîit made me love her even more. I‚Äôm so thankful to have found this, I‚Äôm so thankful that she‚Äôs never made it a big deal. She even buys big containers of soap so it‚Äôll last us longer. Anyways, just wanted to tell someone this. It made me feel so validated and loved in that moment‚Äîespecially when she said that right as I was about to thank her for never making me feel bad about it. I‚Äôm a very lucky guy, and it was just one of those things that made me realize that. Edit: wow thank you guys so much for the love! I promise I will reply to every one of your comments!! Just wanted to leave this here so y‚Äôall know I‚Äôve read every one of them and I appreciate your kind words, and I will respond to all of you when I can!! ‚ù§Ô∏è Edit: sooooo last night my girlfriend found my post (she uses Reddit as well) and got SO excited and said, ‚Äúoh my god!! This is about me!! Did you see all the comments babe?? People are so sweet üò≠‚Äù so thank you all from both of us for the love and kind words! I also appreciate those of you that left suggestions for better lotion. I will definitely look into it seeing as winter is around the corner and I‚Äôm not prepared for how bad my hands are going to get. I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôll find something at some point, and thanks to y‚Äôall I have plenty of options to choose from! I appreciate all the love and kind words. I wasn‚Äôt expecting this much love from this post, but I‚Äôm really glad I got it. Those of you telling me I‚Äôve got a keeper‚ÄîI definitely do. I plan on marrying this girl one day.

{"Title": "How a Serendipitous Encounter with a Beautiful Woman Left a Lasting Impression", "Author": "u/SamFendernot", "Content": "Hey Reddit, Tonight, something really unexpected happened while I was wandering around downtown Naples at about 9:30 pm. I just moved here and was feeling a bit nostalgic, so I decided to check out a few local restaurants to ask about job openings. I figured finding something to do at night a party from my day job would help me settle in. After a few stops, I found this place called Le Colonial, which is a cool mix of Vietnamese and French cuisine. It really caught my eye. Inside, I met someone who really stood out. The manager‚Äîa young blonde with the most striking blue eyes I‚Äôve ever seen‚Äîinitially threw me off because I thought she was the hostess! After a quick chat, I left, but I couldn't stop thinking about her. So, 15 to 20 minutes later, I walked back in, pretending I needed a business card, but honestly, I just wanted to see her again and ask her out. When I asked her out, she seemed pleasantly surprised and genuinely happy, even though she mentioned she had a boyfriend. Her warm smile didn‚Äôt stop me. I took the business card, smiled back, and hinted that I‚Äôd be back. Boyfriend or not, I felt a connection I couldn't ignore. Hopefully, she‚Äôs not getting married anytime soon! I forgot to ask her name and it wasn‚Äôt on the card since she wasn‚Äôt the general manager, but I‚Äôll make sure to remember it next time. Those eyes are hard to forget! Has anyone else had a spontaneous encounter like this? Any tips for my next visit to Le Colonial? I‚Äôd like to build a genuine connection with this beautiful woman while also respecting boundaries. üòà you never know... Q1: What are some subtle, respectful ways to show her I'm interested without overstepping? Q2: Has anyone successfully turned a friendly connection into something more? How did you do it? Q3: Any tips for balancing persistence with respect in situations like this?"},

{"Title": "My boyfriend keeps making me coffees that I can barely keep down but I will \"gladly\" keep drinking them", "Author": "u/thepieintheoven", "Content": "When I was younger my mom used to make what she would call \"children's coffee\", which was essentially heated soy milk (I'm lactose intolerant) mixed with a bit of instant coffee powder. One day while my bf and I were at my parents' house, I asked my mom to make me this \"children's coffee\" and my boyfriend asked me what that was and I explained the story behind it and how I used to drink it a lot when I was younger. That's where it all began. Ffw a few weeks, we're at his mom's house and for a change there's soy milk in the fridge there (leftover from a family holiday we went on) so he asks me if I want children's coffee. Surprised, I asked him if he wanted to make it for me and he said yes. So obviously I agreed, it's a cute gesture. And it was good. Better than my mom's, even. Which is what I told him too. I guess from that point on it became his go-to act of service, because every single day when we're together he asks me if I want children's coffee, sometimes more than once a day too. Every time I say yes, because I can tell it makes him happy to make the coffees. But here's the problem: his recipe tastes HORRIBLE with almond milk. At least the almond milk we have at my parents' house. My mom does not want soy milk in her house because of the estrogen, so this substitute is the only thing my bf could use for the coffee, but man it tastes bad. I'm talking \"the flavor gives me a nauseated feeling if I drink more than half of it\" kind of bad. Still, every time he prepares it for me in the morning, I force myself to drink it all. I've asked him to switch up the recipe a bit to accommodate for the different milk substitute, but it's like no matter what he does, each time it ends up tasting worse. But whenever he hands me that coffee mug with a proud smile on his face it's like he just handed me a cup of love, how could I not drink that? There are many ways to get out of this situation. I am not afraid of being honest. I could easily tell him it just doesn't taste good with almond milk and he will not get upset. But I don't want to. I don't want him to stop doing this. It's almost like the bad flavor makes it better/sweeter? Sometimes I even consider asking him myself if he wants to make me that coffee, knowing it will taste bad. I guess that's just how love works."},

For example, your best friend vs your romantic partner, you love both of them but other than (presumably) also being sexually attracted to your partner and not to your friend (would also appreciate if anyone has advice on what that actually means, is it literally looking at someone and having a desire to have sex with them?), is there a difference in how you feel about them? I feel like there has to be since I know that there are plenty of asexual people or people who just otherwise aren't interested in sex who still fall in love and differentiate between romantic and platonic relationships, so clearly being \"in love\" with someone is different than just loving them.

I keep thinking about having sex with other girls all the time. I used to be a womanizer before being with her, and after two years I wanna go back to it. Sometimes I masturbate seeing other girls instagrams and thinking about other girls. We haven't had sex for a month now, Im just not in the mood to have sex with her. I really love her and we get along but im not sexually satisfied, im just used to having sex with a lot of girls and not just one, I never cheated on her and never will. The problem is she is SUPPER attached to me, I don't wanna hurt her, she would cry a lot and financially she is not very good. We live together in a nice apartment and the lease is not finished until MAY 2025, I was thinking leaving her then which would be much easier since we can part separate ways but im just not happy, and I don't wanna be stuck in a relationship I don't want for one more year. I don't wanna make her unhappy and her to cry but at this point I am in the relationship because of her well being and not because of mine, I can't stop thinking about finishing the relationship not even for one day for the last 4 months. I don't know what to do. If I tell her that I wanna finish and tell her to get another apartment she would not leave. She can't afford this apartment that we are living now, I can afford it even being alone. She can't, so she would need to move to a cheaper place by herself, but she wont want to finish and when she starts crying im gonna feel bad and get back with her... it happened once before, I tried leaving her but I just felt so guilty seeing her crying so I stayed. I just wanna experience what is to be single again. Maybe Im just not made for relationships... what should I do? help )': TLDR: I want but I emotionally can't leave my girlfriend even though im not happy. Live together, lease finishes in 1 year, I was thinking on waiting until then to part ways separate but im just no happy, I wanna experience to be single again."},

The fact that I was able to fall asleep so quickly in the middle of the day with him makes me so happy. Hearing his slow breathing and being all wrapped up is so comforting. There‚Äôs really nothing like it. I feel so lucky. These impromptu naps have happened only a few times, and I look back on every one of them so fondly.

We hadn‚Äôt been together for very long, just a couple months, but we both knew it was very different from anything else we had experienced. We had unashamed conversations of marriage, children, homes, issues, exes, strengths, weaknesses and just what life would be like together. It felt so right, but not in a rose colored glasses way, in a very raw and vulnerable way. One night we were at my house and we were drinking a little bit of wine, we went out to look at the stars and have a little smoke. We were in the middle of a silly conversation and he did a totally random 180 to ask me about what kind of tree growth my woods were (he works in forestry!). I laughed so hard and let the I love you I had been holding on the tip of my tongue for weeks slip. He just laughed along with me and the night continued without mention of what I said. The next day rolls around and this part of the story gets a little confusing but I‚Äôll give the short version. Basically I had a friend who was friends with my partners ex girlfriend. That friend (m) liked to tell me(f) all the negative details of my partners past relationship. I hear another story from this friend and shoot my partner a text. (just to clarify we had been openly communicating about his previous relationship from day one prior to my friends input, as well as all of my previous relationships). I tell him that i heard more from my friend and would like to talk. He comes right over even though i was just expecting a phone call. After we talked everything through we go outside again to let the dogs out. He starts apologizing for putting me through all of this drama because he knows it‚Äôs not really enjoyable for anyone involved. We talk a bit more and I just tell him that it‚Äôs okay, and I trust him, and that our relationship is what we make it and these things don‚Äôt have to influence us negatively, they can build us up. He says ‚ÄúI think I love you.‚Äù, and I tell him that ‚ÄúI know I love you.‚Äù‚Ä¶. A day or two later we‚Äôre talking about it and HE NEVER HEARD MY I LOVE YOU FROM THE PREVIOUS NIGHT!!! He thought he was saying it first and I thought I had said it first. I just find that to be the cutest thing. Neither of us were afraid of taking that first step.

You didn't choose to be an over thinker. You wish you didn't have to re-read or take a second to think about what they said. Their words never seem to come out as hurtful but to you, the over thinker ; they are and they always will be. You try your best not to over analyze the things they say but it never works. You take what is said and make the worst of it. When something of minor inconvenience takes hold, it isn't just minor anymore. It engulfs your entire mind to the point where you are overthinking everything. Every Last Thing . You start to question everything about the relationship. You let your emotions take over and conquer you. You‚Äôre worried, aren't you? You‚Äôre worried that one day your overthinking will be too much and they will leave just like everyone else, right? You don‚Äôt mean to be clingy . You don't want to become a burden that you think you‚Äôre becoming to them. So what do you do? You overthink . You doubt their love for you is as strong as yours. How could they love you the same? As an over thinker you question everything. You‚Äôre worried about them wanting to be with someone else like when they take too long to respond. ‚Äú They must have found someone else‚Äù . As a result; you respond right away because you've been waiting for their response for hours.. You assume that they were talking to someone better. Your mind takes you into a state of emergency of overthinking. Telling you only the wrong things you don't need to hear. When they‚Äôre too busy to see you, it auto corrects in your mind as ‚Äúthey do not want to see me‚Äù. Any simple texts can turn into a roller coaster full of over thinking emotions. Now from everything i've addressed.. Forget about it and take a minute to process what i‚Äôm about to say. Don‚Äôt go back and re-read what they said.. You have nothing to worry about. Do not doubt their love for you, that hurts their feelings. They just have different ways of showing love than you do.You are not a burden to them, they just have a busy life on top of your relationship. They do love you as much as you do. They haven't responded in a while? Be patient, they want to talk to you they are just busy. When they are too busy to see you, don't take it personally; understand that they will make time when they can. They are trying. So try to understand from their point of view as well. So please do not overthink about your relationship, it isn't healthy for you or your partner. How do I know this? Because I have felt the same things.. I have been anxious about not getting a text back in a certain amount of time. I have thought they didn‚Äôt love me anymore because of little things they say. But with that being said, I'm learning (have learned) to not let it control me as much as it used to‚Ä¶ Just remember Everything will be okay, just breathe.

She gives the best hugs and they make me feel AMAZING. Last night we hugged for a solid 30 or 40 minutes. Just on the beach under the cloudy moon lit sky. Dancing and stumbling all over the cool sand but never breaking our embrace. Hardcore hugging, like full on face buried in shoulder standing in the rain hugging. She holds me like she never wants to let go. And tbh I don't ever want her to! Keep in mind that I'm sober, but I felt kinda like I'm rolling, but not as intense but still like it was crazy. I actually feel high when I'm hugging her. Before I met her I was sure that nothing could make me feel as good as heroin, but then she came along. Things are going so well we're just in total bliss.

He is constantly cleaning or helping me clean and takes over dinner 2-3 times a week. He gives me time to myself when my day is overwhelming and never makes me feel bad for it. Our communication has been so good and it‚Äôs easy to just say what is on my mind without worrying about how he will react. And the cherry on top of it all is the fact that I prefer to sleep with my hair braided, but I can‚Äôt braid. So every night he comes in the bathroom while I‚Äôm brushing my teeth and braids it for me. It‚Äôs the things he does that make me so happy. I really appreciate him."},

Sure we have days where we argue but we always resolve and speak fairly to one another. I‚Äôve never loved someone like I love her. Sometimes it‚Äôs like I‚Äôm looking into a mirror we are so alike but we are also so different I can‚Äôt explain it. Most days consist of me getting off work and going to either her place or mine where she will be waiting for me. Then we go to the gym and either cook or get food. After that it‚Äôs yk what time then we shower and watch tv together. It‚Äôs so simple and mundane but so meaningful. I can talk to her about anything and she just gets me and vice versa. She is the most beautiful amazing woman I‚Äôve ever met and I‚Äôm so excited for our future. We will be moving in together near the end of the summer and I haven‚Äôt been this excited for anything in so long. She‚Äôs already started picking out decorations and furniture; it‚Äôs so adorable. She tells me she loves me at least 50 times a day. We‚Äôre both young and started supporting ourselves younger than most so it‚Äôs so nice to be with someone who understands the challenges that comes with. I would do anything for this girl.

He doesn't take his stress and his bad feelings out of me, and if he will, I know he's a human being with slip-ups but it will never be intentional, a routine or a second nature. He's going to accept me, he's already suspected but accepted me anyway even if nothing is confirmed. He encourages this life style, he's so cute complementing and flattering my new hairstyle changes when I'd received threats and backlash. He's defended me when I thought he would've never dared to protest agaisnt his first most beloved person who was the one mistreating me the most.

{"Title": "My boyfriend made me cry happy tears for the first time in my life.", "Author": "u/xduckymoox", "Content": "This happened while we were on the phone late at night, somewhere in the AM. I love listening to him, and he enjoys telling stories, so I laid there with my blanket wrapped around me, listening to him tell me different sweet and happy stories. I felt so comfortable and safe in that moment, like nothing could go wrong. It was such a warm, nice feeling. I told him this, saying how safe, comfortable, and happy I felt. In response, he started saying such kind things. He told me things like: \"You're safe now.\" \"I won't let anything hurt you.\" and \"You can rest now.\" I've never been told anything like this before. My whole life, I've been used to abuse and hurt. To hear such simple yet kind sentences as these... shook me to my core. I started crying. Words like that were so foreign. They didn't feel like words I was meant to hear, yet he was telling me them. He began comforting me as I wept softly, but I was mainly holding back. I've never been good at crying in front of anyone. I made a small, joking comment through the tears like, \"I wonder how much I'd cry if I didn't hold back.\" In response, he told me not to hold back, and to just let myself cry and feel the emotions. And so I did. Crying has always been a painful thing for me. When I cry, there's a genuine pain deep in my stomach and it makes me cry out both from the sheer mental pain and from the physical pain. It's like the deep hurt I have bottled up takes physical form. Yet this crying was... gentle. There was no pain, no crying out. Just... happiness. I've never cried happy tears for anything, but in that moment, with the tears streaming down my face and clouding my eyes, that's all I felt. As I listened to his soothing voice tell me everything was going to be okay and that he wouldn't let anything hurt me, I was genuinely happy. For almost 2 hours afterward, I sobbed as he told me these kind words. I think a part of me healed that night. The part that didn't think it would ever be possible for me to be treated with this kind of kindness and love. The part of me who didn't think I deserved any. And all I felt was relief. Relief both at so much built up pain being alleviated that night, and at the fact that I have someone who loves me enough to help me deal with this pain. It was that night that I realized just how much I really loved him. There's nobody else I'd rather spend the rest of my life with, and I know he's the amazing man I'll marry some day."},

My brother got married this past weekend,  and I'm so happy for him . Little did I know a wedding would break me down , and it did Monday night. Sunday I was exhausted after getting home after it , swollen feet , and sleep deprived . Monday became a Monday for no reason, and it hit like a tidal wave .  I cleaned my car out and vacuumed it out . My dad was being annoying bc he just had to see how good of a job I did on my own car . He wanted to \" Inspect \" it . I said no your not seeing the inside of my car , I bought it and pay for it . He returned with being petty and on my case about stuff . I asked him where I could get my state inspection done , he wasn't a help . Every Monday is trash day .... he is an odd ball about it . I did the dishes after dinner and I apparently had to take the trash out asap .  I was over his attitude mostly. It hit me the wrong way , and then my bf ... I wanted to see him . I offered to get dinner and drinks and I didn't get a response till later on . It was too late to go out with him bc my dad was also making dinner at the time . I was just over the whole day , and I was still exhausted.  I got to see my bf today for lunch on his break , and it was nice . Last night I just bawled.  I bawled like a baby , bc I was over the wedding stuff , my ex husband didn't want to do a huge thing for us getting married, and I guess again grieving in a way . Grieving bc I didn't have a big wedding, grieving bc of a lot back then.  I'm not sure if it was any sort of a trigger , but damn it.  My bf called me tonight like usual , and he is making me dinner , washed the bed sheets and wants to go to the beach for sunset tomorrow . I mentioned that I see him once a week , and it kills me . He offered to spend time with me this weekend as well,  and tomorrow night.  Sometimes , I forget that I have someone who actually cares and loves me . I felt a disconnect from him, but I over think . My gut feelings weren't screaming,  just my heart was aching . I really was sad and mad at the world . I tried to call my bestie , bc she usually helps me figure shit out . I think I understand why I was upset and what I needed.  Long story short , I feel better and get to be spoiled tomorrow night . Oh and the hot water heater blew... so a cold shower is a must tomorrow yay ."},

It was completely out of character for me to go so quickly into a relationship but it just felt natural and it was one of those things where it just felt right to take the chance. We've now been together for a year and a half and I definitely can say I found my person. We not only have similar interests but we get along so well and really understand each other. He does everything he can to make sure I'm happy in the relationship and occasionally asks if there's any issues or concerns I have. He does little things for me like take out the trash, surprise me with little things like Starbucks, or offers to get me food delivered if I'm not feeling well. He also took me to his home country and I got to meet his family and I just felt so welcomed and it was so nice to see where he grew up. I never thought l'd love someone so much that I'm willing to spend a little time everyday learning a new language.

He was complimenting me all night and hugging me every second and kissing all over my forehead and cheek and neck but I loved that I could tell it was endearing and not sexual. Like I literally FELT the affection radiating off of him. On the dance floor we were hugging and I was leaning back on him and he just stayed there for me even tho he HATES dancing and swore off of it. He spent 60% of the night there for me, which I‚Äôm very grateful for. His smile was so genuine and he would look at me and ask for a kiss over and over it was so cute dude.

Anyways, after the bus ride back and cute I just kinda laid on his shoulder and almost passed out on his lap bc I was so exhausted and we took a drive to Dave and busters but he had to leave early, sadly. I think one of the cutest things was him saying ‚Äúthe pictures please, the PhotoBooth and card‚Äù bc I had taken a picture for us and made us save each others table cards and him remembering and saying it in the actual most adorable voice, not like a baby but like imagine a grown man or deep voiced guy just saying it so softly.

Now, I‚Äôm going to his house in a week or two for his pool and we‚Äôre gonna have fun in there there watch a movie together and cuddle in our matching pjs and build a lego set I bought us.

This happened early on in our relationship, a little under four years ago. When we met my guy was starting his recovery from a serious meth addiction and as you can imagine I didn‚Äôt want to be involved with that, at all. So even though we had a serious connection I kept turning him down because I didn‚Äôt want to take any chances there, but after about six months of getting to know him I finally broke down and kissed him. We got together, and things were great. Then about six more months into our relationship there was one bad day where he wasn‚Äôt acting like himself and he was out hanging out with some guys I didn‚Äôt know, and I ended up finding $40 missing from my bank account. When I confronted him about it he admitted what he‚Äôd done. And I took my time to think about what that meant to me, because obviously I couldn‚Äôt just ignore what had happened. I definitely wasn‚Äôt going to just sit there and let him do things like that, to me or to himself. I wasn‚Äôt going to be an enabler and I wasn‚Äôt going to tie myself to that. So I took him and sat him down. And I explained that I knew he was recovering from a serious addiction and because of that I was going to forgive him for what had happened. And I also explained that I would give him two years. I wouldn‚Äôt commit to anything serious in that time, but if he could stay completely clean and sober it would show me that he was serious about our relationship. And to show him I was just as serious, I said that if he could do that, I would marry him. Now, four years later, he‚Äôs still completely sober and we‚Äôre engaged and I can say without a doubt that giving him a second chance that night was absolutely the best decision I have ever made. He is the love of my life. He never hesitates to tell me how beautiful I am or how much he loves me, and when I‚Äôm feeling bad he always does everything he possibly can to make me feel better.

One of Siri's skills is to play music all over the house when we ask her to. As we are both working at our computers, listening to music, the song \"In the Arms of the Angels\" starts to play. My wonderful, loving partner knew that song would trigger intense grief in me and make me cry. As soon as it started playing, he stood up, came to my computer, put his arms around me and said, \"Come on, let's go snuggle.\" I was already crying. My partner led me to the bed, pulled me into his arms, told Siri to stop the music, held me, and talked to me about my son until I stopped crying. I have never felt so loved.

How can someone be loved unconditionally if they don't show who they truly are to others? When I say this I mean, their fears, insecurities, and doubts in the moment as well as the positives. So many go out their way to protect their own ego that they hurt those willing to want to love them for who they are. I do think a lot is because of issues with perfectionism and what it means to be attractive. It's scary to actually put yourself truly on the line like that. But by doing so makes you a fantasticaslly strong individual. To accept and understand that you are a perfectly imperfect individual takes a lot of strength, and through that strength is being vulnerable you can have a chance at unconditional love.

My ex wife despised me.", "Author": "u/saffermaster", "Content": "After a few years licking my wounds, I put myself out there at age 55, trying to find love. I spent 4 years enjoying kinky sex with women of every age. From 18 to 60. Nothing I did could fill the emptiness I felt in my broken heart. One woman I dated shared with me that in spite of my sense of failure, that she found me imminently lovable. Another lover told me that I am too distant and \"You need to let me in,\" I went out and got a tattoo on my chest that took 7 months to complete. It captured my sense that attraction was possible, that there was a certain randomity to the world, that we lived in an endless universe and that I am lovable. Its a cool trash punk tattoo. I looked hard at what was missing from my marriage. It occurred to me that intimacy was missing. One day I got a message from a woman on a kink site who saw my \"seeking post\". She was as kinky as me and also looking for intimacy and we started a dialogue. We courted for 6 months before we began our dynamic formally. That was 6 years ago. in 6 days I am going to marry her. I could not be happier. We not only found love, we fell in love and have had a steamy love affair that goes on and on. I am so here for it. Its possible to find love. I can guarantee that there is love after divorce. My life is poetry. Update: Kink is interesting. People of all ages participate. There are kids who learn about kink at a very young age, and are perhaps more ready to explore kink when they get to age 18 than others are till much later in life. One thing about being Dom in a kink setting like a club or munch is that submissives of all ages and genders approach you and negotiate a scene with you. Remember, all kink is based on consent, not persuasion, informed enthusiastic consent. I should have noted that I practice RACK which is Risk-Aware Consensual Kink, and SSC, Safe, Sane Consensual Kink. I get the idea that morality has it that young adults should not play with old adults, but that is simply your own ick, nobody else's.

We made our relationship official in April, so I like to think we took it pretty slow. In every other relationship I have ever had, I felt the need to be so careful about my body, my choices, and never felt at home with my partners. I always was waiting for the next step of where I was going to go to next. I made sure that we used multiple forms of protection when we were intimate. I never felt like I could be my sensitive, extroverted self fully. Before we became romantic, he helped me pass the final course I needed for my first degree. I had been calling my \"Rave Husband\", because we were always attached at the hip at the many raves we stuffed into a year. He spent the day with me after I had emergency surgery, just so I wouldn't be alone. He is one of the only people that has ever made an effort to celebrate my birthday. He got out of his car when I did, because he thought he was going to have to pull me off of some guy in front of a bar, and still decided to want me. He watched me projectile vomit outside of a show in 100 degree weather, and left early with me, and cuddled me while I looked like a drowned sewer rat months long before he declared his feelings. With this man??? I told this man today that I trust him enough to decide when and if he ever wants to put a baby in me. I told this man that I would provide for him whatever he desires in this world and then more. I made this man know I intend on marrying him and making sure that he smiles every day for the rest of his life. I let this man do things to me today that I would have never allowed anyone else do. Suddenly, just like magic, I would give him everything I am and still be searching for more to give him. Every day, I find out more about him that makes my love grow even bigger. I sat in my bedroom for hours today waiting for him to call on his work break, in shock with myself at the words that had come out of my mouth to him before he had left. Never in my life have I been down this bad for someone. Every day it gets worse. I grieve for the time in this life that I won't get to spend with him. I have never wanted to just spend a day laying around with someone. It's like I have been possessed.

Is that a valid statement to say? Maybe you do want my love but baby I want all of you not just part of you. Please come home and sit still inside me because I would hate to see you come and go. Until you find someone new‚Ä¶ I‚Äôll be here‚Ä¶ until you find someone new Ill be here. I just wanted to make you know how I feel although it may bug you I‚Äôm overthinking. I just wish things were different. I know you may feel different. I love you for it regardless. I love to see you prosper with or without me. It hurts but baby I‚Äôm here in the back of the ceremony rooting for you, so happy for you, I know your eyes are fixed on someone new and other things so you don‚Äôt notice me and that‚Äôs fine, here I am, happy for your accomplishments. I will forever love you as long as I know who I am and the love I have experienced. I will always pray for you and your family as I have been doing. Thank you for reading this. You don‚Äôt have to talk about anything I said. Sincerely, the boy who dreams countless lucid dreams and with you by my side, for infinity. Give me your hand and let me put a ring on it, forever kiss it. I can never break this bond even when you come crashing like thunderstorms from the southern states to the Great Plains."},

If my partner is in bed with me asleep I'll leave the bed to sleep on the sofa because I don't want my movement and lights to keep him up. He doesn't really like waking up without me so I try to sneak into bed before he gets up, but I can't always do it. Anyway last night I fell asleep on the sofa and I was scrolling from about 2-5 AM. He came in about 5 with his favourite stuffed toy, he was in a daze a bit but said \"aww are you up? I thought I'd give you (toys name) for company.\" Then he asked me to come back to bed and we cuddled for a bit. It's just really nice. I never ever thought I'd find someone like this."},

{"Title": "A little story of how I met the girl I‚Äôve been talking to.", "Author": "u/Zealousideal_Ad321", "Content": "Sorry, this will be long, but very worth the read. The feeling of new love is so euphoric, I just have to share. We have decided not to put a label on what we have going on, so I don‚Äôt consider her my girlfriend by any means. I broke up with an ex of 1 year about a month and a half ago, and since about 4 weeks ago, me and this girl have been talking more than before, and hanging out. I never even thought about flirting or making a move, because I was in the process of getting out of a relationship I felt stuck in. More than anyone else, she helped me understand what was wrong with my relationship and would always give pointers on how to make relationships more successful. I had given up on love. For months before I broke up with my ex, me and this girl talked all the time about love. I explained to her many many times that I‚Äôve lost faith in relationships. My ex of 5 years cheated on me along with physical abuse. My ex after that started acting like my other ex(very violent) and I decided that no one should ever feel threatened by their partner, even if they haven‚Äôt taken a swing yet. This girl explained to me that life is about taking chances and dating shouldn‚Äôt be ruled out just yet. Always kind of hinting at the thought of us being together. I work as a CNA in a long term care facility and she does the same PRN. We don‚Äôt work together much, but everytime we have, it seems like every one of our coworkers seem to think we were together. It‚Äôs not just our coworkers, the residents we take care of hint at it and tease us both about dating each other. A week or so after I broke up with my ex, I was on the phone with her. We talked about what went wrong and why I had bad luck with dating before. She kept expressing to not lose hope. The next day we worked together and while we were changing residents/doing vitals etc, she kept sort of bumping into me. She would stand really close when we talked and never took her eye off me. I knew what was happening and I wasn‚Äôt about to let my insecurities pass this off. We started talking about taking it super slow in a relationship being the best choice. She mentions she wouldn‚Äôt mind doing something like that and I say the same. To hang out, talk all the time, whatever couples do, just not labeling it. We figure that‚Äôs the best way to do things, except that we‚Äôve already knew each other for 11 months that I‚Äôve been working with her and have became very good friends. When she brings this up I knew for a fact that she wanted to go out with me, so I asked her if she wanted to come have some drinks and watch some movies at my house. She very quickly agreed and we made a date to hang out. When the time comes, she shows up at my house, like an hour late(she had a good excuse) and we start talking. We put on a movie but not a second of it was watched. We just talked and talked. I knew I couldn‚Äôt chicken out and not make a move, and I also knew that with her being very shy, there was no way she was going to make a move. Everytime I got up from the couch to grab another beer or make her a drink, I would sit closer and closer when I got back to the couch. At this point I‚Äôve had 2 or 3 beers and I was starting to feel my intuition slip away. Even if she tells me she doesn‚Äôt like me like that, I‚Äôll be able to defend my actions and apologize, so what‚Äôs to lose? I had this overwhelming feeling that I misunderstood all of our talks and all the hints, all the things residents and coworkers have said. I felt like she wasn‚Äôt comfortable and that I was going to make a big mistake if I were to make a move.  After making her a drink and sitting down right next to her, were our arms are touching, I throw my arm around her and she sinks into me, holding me, like she‚Äôs been waiting 11 months for this. I‚Äôve never felt so exhilarated in my life. I figured I‚Äôve got it in the bag, so I lean in to kiss her and she grabs my face and pulls it closer. We ended up making out for quite some time before she had to leave for work in the morning. I felt very very happy about this and high on life. Within a couple days we had already set up another time for us to hang out. I decided we should go on a hike, then back to my house. That was very successful as well and I felt like there was nothing stopping us from continuing this. She‚Äôs been on vacation for the last 2 weeks but we plan to go camping next Wednesday and Thursday on an island. We have so much in common and she is absolutely stunning. I can‚Äôt mess this up, but I at least know for sure that even if it doesn‚Äôt work out, we will still be great friends. Thank you for all that came to listen , have a great day!"},

{"Title": "I love my boyfriend so much it hurts. He makes me so happy.", "Author": "u/sheerest_of_folly", "Content": "I know not many people will likely care to read my rant, but I love this man so fucking much. We‚Äôve been dating for almost 3 years (anniversary in July). For 2.5 of them, we were online. Online relationships are hard. He‚Äôs in South Carolina, I was in Maryland. I decided to move to him. On the way down, on January 31st, literally 40 minutes away, my mom fell asleep at the wheel and we crashed into the moving van (she was going to drop me off, as she herself was moving to Florida with my youngest sibling. Other sibling stayed with Dad in Maryland for college.) I was the only one moderately injured in the wreck (thank God) and was taken to the hospital in an ambulance. I told my boyfriend where. He met me there. I saw my boyfriend in person for the first time while on a hospital bed. The first few months were rough for me to settle in. 21 years in Maryland in the same area my whole life was hard to transition from. My boyfriend was with me every step of the way. March was the anniversary of the deaths of several people who were important to me in my youth. They died in a car crash when I was a young teen. In Maryland, every year I would go to the playground we all played at on their deathiversary, since none of them were buried (all cremated to my knowledge). My boyfriend drove me the 500 miles to go back to Maryland to be at that playground. In April, I had a breast reduction surgery. The recovery for that was rough‚Äî for the first two weeks, I couldn‚Äôt reach my middle well enough to use the bathroom. This man wiped my pee for me, and once the anesthesia wore off, my poop too. I got my period in the second week. He learned how to put a tampon in me and take it out. He was by my side the whole time. The breast reduction was done in Maryland and we stayed with my father for a week. I‚Äôve only seen my father cry three times: when our cat died, at the end of Star Wars (because ‚Äúit‚Äôs so happy, they got the medals they worked so hard for‚Äù üíÄ), and when my boyfriend and I left. My father said he‚Äôs a good man and he‚Äôs so happy for us. He also gave him $400 to ‚Äúpay him back‚Äù for medical expenses. My boyfriend ended up using the remainder on a date with me. Speaking of dates. I love notebooks and pens; my boyfriend doesn‚Äôt really care about those. Yet he took me on a date to Staples and Michaels, I thought to window shop but he bought so much for me. He also gets me some model skulls that I collect when he sees a cool one. Shortly after I moved in, he came home with one meant for an aquarium: ‚ÄúI thought of you.‚Äù I cried. We went to MomoCon this year, and he cosplayed with me. We went as Leon and Ada from the Resident Evil series (specifically the RE4 remake). He waited in line for Digimon and Pok√©mon voice actors with me and listened to me rant about the characters I like. We‚Äôre getting married next year. We aren‚Äôt conventionally engaged yet‚Äî he has something planned but won‚Äôt tell me‚Äî but we know we‚Äôre getting married. We just haven‚Äôt told our families yet. I‚Äôm so fucking excited and happy that this is the man I get to spend my life with."},

He was so affectionate and calling me perfect and ‚Äúmore beautiful in person‚Äù and be was so patient about everything including our first kiss, which made me like him 1000x more. I think we touched foreheads about 5 times trying to go for the first kiss but I kept backing out LOL. After the first one, the rest were so easy. He was complimenting me all night and hugging me every second and kissing all over my forehead and cheek and neck but I loved that I could tell it was endearing and not sexual. Like I literally FELT the affection radiating off of him. On the dance floor we were hugging and I was leaning back on him and he just stayed there for me even tho he HATES dancing and swore off of it. He spent 60% of the night there for me, which I‚Äôm very grateful for. His smile was so genuine and he would look at me and ask for a kiss over and over it was so cute dude. Everything physical he took his time w, which btw didnt go far but like what we did do he was so gentle with and asked ‚Äúcan I‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..‚Äù ‚Äúyes or no?‚Äù I found it so adorable in the moment. ik it‚Äôs bare minimum but it‚Äôs just a relief and honestly blessing knowing he cares how I feel in the moment and thinks about me when he‚Äôs horny ig? üò≠ Like seriously, even our tongue kiss was so gentle. I was so nervous and he was like ‚Äúfor one second, I‚Äôll teach you,‚Äù and not in a demanding way but more question and care. I did it and then did it 1-2 more times for a couple seconds and got embarrassed and dug my head into his chest bc I thought I was doing really bad, and then I just like mumbled ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know what to do or how to do it..‚Äù and he reassured me the second after and was saying ‚Äúnooooo it was good‚Ä¶.baby it was perfect, I swear.‚Äù and I was blushing the WHOLE TIME. Anyways, after the bus ride back and cute I just kinda laid on his shoulder and almost passed out on his lap bc I was so exhausted and we took a drive to Dave and busters but he had to leave early, sadly. I think one of the cutest things was him saying ‚Äúthe pictures please, the PhotoBooth and card‚Äù bc I had taken a picture for us and made us save each others table cards and him remembering and saying it in the actual most adorable voice, not like a baby but like imagine a grown man or deep voiced guy just saying it so softly. Then he said I love you and I‚Äôll miss you and we kissed goodbye üôÅ. Now, I‚Äôm going to his house in a week or two for his pool and we‚Äôre gonna have fun in there there watch a movie together and cuddle in our matching pjs and build a lego set I bought us. I‚Äôm so happy so have stuck through the long year of petty fights and lack of touch bc it was all worth it. Our 15 months is in 6 days, it feels surreal.

This happened early on in our relationship, a little under four years ago. When we met my guy was starting his recovery from a serious meth addiction and as you can imagine I didn‚Äôt want to be involved with that, at all. So even though we had a serious connection I kept turning him down because I didn‚Äôt want to take any chances there, but after about six months of getting to know him I finally broke down and kissed him. We got together, and things were great. Then about six more months into our relationship there was one bad day where he wasn‚Äôt acting like himself and he was out hanging out with some guys I didn‚Äôt know, and I ended up finding $40 missing from my bank account. When I confronted him about it he admitted what he‚Äôd done. And I took my time to think about what that meant to me, because obviously I couldn‚Äôt just ignore what had happened. I definitely wasn‚Äôt going to just sit there and let him do things like that, to me or to himself. I wasn‚Äôt going to be an enabler and I wasn‚Äôt going to tie myself to that. So I took him and sat him down. And I explained that I knew he was recovering from a serious addiction and because of that I was going to forgive him for what had happened. And I also explained that I would give him two years. I wouldn‚Äôt commit to anything serious in that time, but if he could stay completely clean and sober it would show me that he was serious about our relationship. And to show him I was just as serious, I said that if he could do that, I would marry him. Now, four years later, he‚Äôs still completely sober and we‚Äôre engaged and I can say without a doubt that giving him a second chance that night was absolutely the best decision I have ever made. He is the love of my life. He never hesitates to tell me how beautiful I am or how much he loves me, and when I‚Äôm feeling bad he always does everything he possibly can to make me feel better. He is my world."},

We each have a computer in here, and there is also a bed for napping. Just before I moved here two months ago, he set up Apple Home using Siri. One of Siri's skills is to play music all over the house when we ask her to. As we are both working at our computers, listening to music, the song \"In the Arms of the Angels\" starts to play. My wonderful, loving partner knew that song would trigger intense grief in me and make me cry. As soon as it started playing, he stood up, came to my computer, put his arms around me and said, \"Come on, let's go snuggle.\" I was already crying. My partner led me to the bed, pulled me into his arms, told Siri to stop the music, held me, and talked to me about my son until I stopped crying. I have never felt so loved.

But then on the other those very same individuals get too scared/timid to actually let others in on real emotionally intimate level. How can someone be loved unconditionally if they don't show who they truly are to others? When I say this I mean, their fears, insecurities, and doubts in the moment as well as the positives. So many go out their way to protect their own ego that they hurt those willing to want to love them for who they are. I do think a lot is because of issues with perfectionism and what it means to be attractive. It's scary to actually put yourself truly on the line like that. But by doing so makes you a fantasticaslly strong individual. To accept and understand that you are a perfectly imperfect individual takes a lot of strength, and through that strength is being vulnerable you can have a chance at unconditional love.

{"Title": "For 30 Years, I loved with contempt. My ex wife despised me.", "Author": "u/saffermaster", "Content": "After a few years licking my wounds, I put myself out there at age 55, trying to find love. I spent 4 years enjoying kinky sex with women of every age. From 18 to 60. Nothing I did could fill the emptiness I felt in my broken heart. One woman I dated shared with me that in spite of my sense of failure, that she found me imminently lovable. Another lover told me that I am too distant and \"You need to let me in,\" I went out and got a tattoo on my chest that took 7 months to complete. It captured my sense that attraction was possible, that there was a certain randomity to the world, that we lived in an endless universe and that I am lovable. Its a cool trash punk tattoo. I looked hard at what was missing from my marriage. It occurred to me that intimacy was missing. One day I got a message from a woman on a kink site who saw my \"seeking post\". She was as kinky as me and also looking for intimacy and we started a dialogue. We courted for 6 months before we began our dynamic formally. That was 6 years ago. in 6 days I am going to marry her. I could not be happier. We not only found love, we fell in love and have had a steamy love affair that goes on and on. I am so here for it. Its possible to find love. I can guarantee that there is love after divorce. My life is poetry. Update: Kink is interesting. People of all ages participate. There are kids who learn about kink at a very young age, and are perhaps more ready to explore kink when they get to age 18 than others are till much later in life. One thing about being Dom in a kink setting like a club or munch is that submissives of all ages and genders approach you and negotiate a scene with you. Remember, all kink is based on consent, not persuasion, informed enthusiastic consent. I should have noted that I practice RACK which is Risk-Aware Consensual Kink, and SSC, Safe, Sane Consensual Kink. I get the idea that morality has it that young adults should not play with old adults, but that is simply your own ick, nobody else's.

We made our relationship official in April, so I like to think we took it pretty slow. In every other relationship I have ever had, I felt the need to be so careful about my body, my choices, and never felt at home with my partners. I always was waiting for the next step of where I was going to go to next. I made sure that we used multiple forms of protection when we were intimate. I never felt like I could be my sensitive, extroverted self fully. Before we became romantic, he helped me pass the final course I needed for my first degree. I had been calling my \"Rave Husband\", because we were always attached at the hip at the many raves we stuffed into a year. He spent the day with me after I had emergency surgery, just so I wouldn't be alone. He is one of the only people that has ever made an effort to celebrate my birthday. He got out of his car when I did, because he thought he was going to have to pull me off of some guy in front of a bar, and still decided to want me. He watched me projectile vomit outside of a show in 100 degree weather, and left early with me, and cuddled me while I looked like a drowned sewer rat months long before he declared his feelings. With this man??? I told this man today that I trust him enough to decide when and if he ever wants to put a baby in me. I told this man that I would provide for him whatever he desires in this world and then more. I made this man know I intend on marrying him and making sure that he smiles every day for the rest of his life. I let this man do things to me today that I would have never allowed anyone else do. Suddenly, just like magic, I would give him everything I am and still be searching for more to give him. Every day, I find out more about him that makes my love grow even bigger. I sat in my bedroom for hours today waiting for him to call on his work break, in shock with myself at the words that had come out of my mouth to him before he had left. Never in my life have I been down this bad for someone. Every day it gets worse. I grieve for the time in this life that I won't get to spend with him. I have never wanted to just spend a day laying around with someone. It's like I have been possessed. Somehow, I have known my best friend for over a year now and the love I have for him only continues to grow exponentially with time that I fear I may one day explode. SOS"},

I thought I'd give you (toys name) for company.\" Then he asked me to come back to bed and we cuddled for a bit. It's just really nice. I never ever thought I'd find someone like this."},

{"Title": "I love my boyfriend so much it hurts. He makes me so happy.", "Author": "u/sheerest_of_folly", "Content": "I know not many people will likely care to read my rant, but I love this man so fucking much. We‚Äôve been dating for almost 3 years (anniversary in July). For 2.5 of them, we were online. Online relationships are hard. He‚Äôs in South Carolina, I was in Maryland. I decided to move to him. On the way down, on January 31st, literally 40 minutes away, my mom fell asleep at the wheel and we crashed into the moving van (she was going to drop me off, as she herself was moving to Florida with my youngest sibling. Other sibling stayed with Dad in Maryland for college.) I was the only one moderately injured in the wreck (thank God) and was taken to the hospital in an ambulance. I told my boyfriend where. He met me there. I saw my boyfriend in person for the first time while on a hospital bed. The first few months were rough for me to settle in. 21 years in Maryland in the same area my whole life was hard to transition from. My boyfriend was with me every step of the way. March was the anniversary of the deaths of several people who were important to me in my youth. They died in a car crash when I was a young teen. In Maryland, every year I would go to the playground we all played at on their deathiversary, since none of them were buried (all cremated to my knowledge). My boyfriend drove me the 500 miles to go back to Maryland to be at that playground. In April, I had a breast reduction surgery. The recovery for that was rough‚Äî for the first two weeks, I couldn‚Äôt reach my middle well enough to use the bathroom. This man wiped my pee for me, and once the anesthesia wore off, my poop too. I got my period in the second week. He learned how to put a tampon in me and take it out. He was by my side the whole time. The breast reduction was done in Maryland and we stayed with my father for a week. I‚Äôve only seen my father cry three times: when our cat died, at the end of Star Wars (because ‚Äúit‚Äôs so happy, they got the medals they worked so hard for‚Äù üíÄ), and when my boyfriend and I left. My father said he‚Äôs a good man and he‚Äôs so happy for us. He also gave him $400 to ‚Äúpay him back‚Äù for medical expenses. My boyfriend ended up using the remainder on a date with me. Speaking of dates. I love notebooks and pens; my boyfriend doesn‚Äôt really care about those. Yet he took me on a date to Staples and Michaels, I thought to window shop but he bought so much for me. He also gets me some model skulls that I collect when he sees a cool one. Shortly after I moved in, he came home with one meant for an aquarium: ‚ÄúI thought of you.‚Äù I cried. We went to MomoCon this year, and he cosplayed with me. We went as Leon and Ada from the Resident Evil series (specifically the RE4 remake). He waited in line for Digimon and Pok√©mon voice actors with me and listened to me rant about the characters I like. We‚Äôre getting married next year. We aren‚Äôt conventionally engaged yet‚Äî he has something planned but won‚Äôt tell me‚Äî but we know we‚Äôre getting married. We just haven‚Äôt told our families yet.

The feeling of new love is so euphoric, I just have to share. We have decided not to put a label on what we have going on, so I don‚Äôt consider her my girlfriend by any means. I broke up with an ex of 1 year about a month and a half ago, and since about 4 weeks ago, me and this girl have been talking more than before, and hanging out. I never even thought about flirting or making a move, because I was in the process of getting out of a relationship I felt stuck in. More than anyone else, she helped me understand what was wrong with my relationship and would always give pointers on how to make relationships more successful. I had given up on love. For months before I broke up with my ex, me and this girl talked all the time about love. I explained to her many many times that I‚Äôve lost faith in relationships. My ex of 5 years cheated on me along with physical abuse. My ex after that started acting like my other ex(very violent) and I decided that no one should ever feel threatened by their partner, even if they haven‚Äôt taken a swing yet. This girl explained to me that life is about taking chances and dating shouldn‚Äôt be ruled out just yet. Always kind of hinting at the thought of us being together. I work as a CNA in a long term care facility and she does the same PRN. We don‚Äôt work together much, but everytime we have, it seems like every one of our coworkers seem to think we were together. It‚Äôs not just our coworkers, the residents we take care of hint at it and tease us both about dating each other. A week or so after I broke up with my ex, I was on the phone with her. We talked about what went wrong and why I had bad luck with dating before. She kept expressing to not lose hope. The next day we worked together and while we were changing residents/doing vitals etc, she kept sort of bumping into me. She would stand really close when we talked and never took her eye off me. I knew what was happening and I wasn‚Äôt about to let my insecurities pass this off. We started talking about taking it super slow in a relationship being the best choice. She mentions she wouldn‚Äôt mind doing something like that and I say the same. To hang out, talk all the time, whatever couples do, just not labeling it. We figure that‚Äôs the best way to do things, except that we‚Äôve already knew each other for 11 months that I‚Äôve been working with her and have became very good friends. When she brings this up I knew for a fact that she wanted to go out with me, so I asked her if she wanted to come have some drinks and watch some movies at my house. She very quickly agreed and we made a date to hang out. When the time comes, she shows up at my house, like an hour late(she had a good excuse) and we start talking. We put on a movie but not a second of it was watched. We just talked and talked. I knew I couldn‚Äôt chicken out and not make a move, and I also knew that with her being very shy, there was no way she was going to make a move. Everytime I got up from the couch to grab another beer or make her a drink, I would sit closer and closer when I got back to the couch. At this point I‚Äôve had 2 or 3 beers and I was starting to feel my intuition slip away. Even if she tells me she doesn‚Äôt like me like that, I‚Äôll be able to defend my actions and apologize, so what‚Äôs to lose? I had this overwhelming feeling that I misunderstood all of our talks and all the hints, all the things residents and coworkers have said. I felt like she wasn‚Äôt comfortable and that I was going to make a big mistake if I were to make a move.  After making her a drink and sitting down right next to her, were our arms are touching, I throw my arm around her and she sinks into me, holding me, like she‚Äôs been waiting 11 months for this. I‚Äôve never felt so exhilarated in my life. I figured I‚Äôve got it in the bag, so I lean in to kiss her and she grabs my face and pulls it closer. We ended up making out for quite some time before she had to leave for work in the morning. I felt very very happy about this and high on life. Within a couple days we had already set up another time for us to hang out. I decided we should go on a hike, then back to my house. That was very successful as well and I felt like there was nothing stopping us from continuing this. She‚Äôs been on vacation for the last 2 weeks but we plan to go camping next Wednesday and Thursday on an island. We have so much in common and she is absolutely stunning. I can‚Äôt mess this up, but I at least know for sure that even if it doesn‚Äôt work out, we will still be great friends. Thank you for all that came to listen , have a great day!"},

The tears on your face as we said I love you for the last time are forever imprinted in my memory. You don't know how badly I wanted to wipe them away, kiss your forehead, and promise you it would be okay. I knew I couldn't, because then I would never get out of your car. I've been trying to keep myself busy. Started going to the gym every day instead of every other. It hasn't really helped too much, but it's nice to keep my mind off you for a few hours. I stare at my bare ring finger more often than I should. I still instinctively go to grab my ring off my dresser when I wake up every morning, even though it's not there anymore. Everything makes me think of you. The cicadas chirping makes me think of us laughing when you told me they keep getting caught in your windshield. The news reminds me of our long drives where we would discuss politics and everything going on in the world. Every outfit I put on reminds me of when I would wear it with you. Inside Out 2 comes out in two days! I hope you're as excited as I am. I know we've been planning for months on watching it together on opening night. A part of me wonders if we'll be watching it at the same time at different theatres, laughing and crying at the same parts of it. Honestly, I'm probably just going to cry through this whole thing as I wish you were by my side while I watch. Maybe I'll wait to see it until I feel ready. I hope you still get to see it, though. I can't stop living in the \"what ifs\" of it all. What could have been different, what could have changed. I yearn for you. My heart feels half empty. I know it's unhealthy to live in the past, but the only way I've been able to fall asleep at night is when I replay our old memories in our head. Even then, I wake up in the middle of the night gasping and imagining the past few days have just been some fucked up nightmare. I had to mute your number, because every time my phone buzzed, deep down I hoped it was you. Even still, I find myself constantly looking at the little red numbers above the texting app, hoping it goes up by one. The amount of times I dialed your number just to not hit call is pathetic. I just need to hear your voice. I know this yearning is unhealthy, but I don't know when it will go away. I miss your smile, and the way your nose scrunches when you're really happy. I miss your silky black hair and your mocha skin. I miss your dark brown eyes that I would constantly get lost in. I miss your touch and I miss your kisses. I miss feeling the tightness when you squeeze me when we hug. I miss hearing your heart beat when I rest my head on your chest. I remember the first time I ever did that way back when we first staring dating and I could feel it racing, it made me blush. I miss your gentle voice and your roaring laugh. I miss our deep talks and our petty gossip. I even miss our fights, as dumb as that sounds. I just miss everything. It's been hard to scroll through social media because anytime I see something that reminds me of you, I want to send it to you. I've been sending them to my own number instead. In fact, to be honest, I've been texting my own number a lot. Whenever I want to text you, I just text it to myself. It still cuts like glass when the message immediately bounces back. Anyway, my eyes are getting misty so I'll stop here. Goodbye, my love. Maybe in another life, we'll do things right. I love you infinity plus one, ha I win."},

All was understood and glad this was clear and upfront, but after it ended I came to a strange realization. Compared to all flings or real relationships (some more healthy/successful than others) I've had in the past it was the most authentic affection I've received so far. And the most I've wanted to give affection in return. I'm not particularly sad or regretful in any way cause I knew the conditions, but I'm startled that I can confidently say a less than two month fling felt more honest and caring than any previous entanglement had. I don't think it's because it is more fresh in my mind, just to state. I guess I just always felt like I did more or more was always expected from me than was ever given.

I've made a mini photo album of pictures of us as well as a painted picture frame and a few little random trinkets that I've made. Does anyone have any ideas of crafts or little things I could add to it? I don't have much to spend, so I'm going for cheap or handmade things. Any ideas would be helpful!!! <3"},

{"Title": "Love is complicated, but I don't think I would have it any other way.", "Author": "u/Either_Title645", "Content": "So this is going to be a story of quick sudden love, heart ache, friendship, and thoughts on what the future may bring. I've gone back and forth on if I should tell this story, but I'm a writer at heart and putting thoughts and emotions to words is how I work through it all, and maybe someone will read this and feel something, also so all the kids out there know that love is never simple, and you are bound to get caught up in it even well into your adult years. So back in January I met lets call her N, and we instantly connected. Like she called me the night after our coffee date to talk more, it was just so comfortable, we texted every day, called few times a week. Within a couple weeks we'd been on three more dates and made things official, after that we spent every weekend either at her place or mine, and occasionally got together during the week too. N and I have a dozen things in common, specific video games, humor, movies, and even our obscure fashion and interior design choices match. We shared personal, private pains. Before two months were up she had told me she loved me, I'd told her I was getting there, I had met her friends more than once, and we both had told our parents about each other. It seemed like a beautiful beginning. But then it ended suddenly. She had a bout of insecurities and she felt like she didn't deserve me, I couldn't convince her I was happy with her, and she ended things. But neither of us wanted the other out of our lives. We continued to talk every day, call each other, and we still regularly got together in person. After more than a month it looked from my side like we could start again, but N had an old long distance friend. This guy had never been too happy we were dating, and had decided now was a good time to come down and see N for the first time in years. I had an opportunity to tell N how I truly felt before he showed up, N and I had gone out drinking the night before he arrived, and though she showed doubt about what she wanted from her old friend, there was wonder too. So rather than throw an emotional bomb at her the night before, I kept my silence. I told her a week later, though I knew she had decided to be with him. I told her, not to confuse or ask anything of her, simply because she deserved to know. Her old insecurities had been wrong, and I still wanted to be a part of her life. She was not happy. Mad that I had taken so long to feel what she had felt months earlier, mad that I hadn't said anything that last night, mad that she thought I was only pretending to be friends, and even still insecure that I could still want someone like her in my life. That was only a month ago, and to this day we talk everyday, call at least once a week, and see each other nearly every week. We are both excited for an upcoming con, a game release later this year, and she expressed wanting to go to renn faire with me still. She is fast becoming my best friend, and I honestly am so happy I met her, I don't regret a thing. I don't know what the future holds, I'm casually looking for another partner, but mainly on bettering myself. We may or may not ever get back together, but I hope that in five years we are still talking every day, and getting together once a week to see each other. Love is beautiful in all forms, even at times in heartbreak and lost potential."},

I‚Äôve been seeing her for almost a year and I‚Äôm still anticipating someone popping out with a camera crew to let me know it‚Äôs all been a set up, but it never happens. I tried dating apps and asking people out for the better part of a decade not really feeling much of a connection or finding a spark that fizzled out quickly. In the last couple years I realized I was asexual. The general population is less than 1% ace, and of that one percent you‚Äôre lucky if you find 1 or 2 people you have something in common with. When I saw her dating profile I was floored. Someone who was more like me than anyone I‚Äôd ever seen on any dating app, ace, and incredibly beautiful. We hit it off pretty quickly through text chat and quickly moved to phone calls. We have similar niche hobbies, asthetics, work in the same industry, similar off brand humor, politics, values, and so many more things. She‚Äôs hilarious, nerdy, an incredible artist talented beyond her years, jaw dropping beautiful, smart, affectionate and caring. I have so many overwhelming feelings about her and our time together so far, like on our first date when she held my arm as we drunkenly walked the city streets looking at an festival market and playing ski ball together at the arcade, or our second date having a picnic in the botanical gardens, looking at all the Christmas lights in town til dark and doing star gazing. It‚Äôs been almost a year of dating and every one we go one seems impossibly magical  putting rom coms to shame. We spend a few evenings each week playing board games online, cracking jokes and telling each other about what‚Äôs going on in our lives. It‚Äôs been like finding a new best friend who I can also cuddle and shower with admiration. I‚Äôm mostly writing this because I can‚Äôt see her immediately and need to vent all this loving energy somewhere. I can‚Äôt wait til I get to see her again, sharing time with her just makes that time so much brighter!"},

{"Title": "To rekindle, or not to rekindle that is the question *lengthy*", "Author": "u/Traditional-Wait-827", "Content": "So there is a boy M (26?) and me F (28) that met about 8 years ago. We had mutuals so we would come around each other when our friends had kickbacks etc. I began to pursue him because I thought he was cute and liked him. Eventually he showed me that he reciprocated so we began to date and go out. We would go to sports games out to dinners & he would come over often to swim etc.  we had a real strong connection and all- This all happened so fast, but we were young and in love. even though I wanted him to make me his girlfriend he never did because he didn't know that I wanted that. Eventually I got back with my ex & we decided to stay as \"friends\". Obviously the relationship with my ex didn't work out and we ended up breaking up indefinitely. I continued to live my life, but I couldn't help but not being able to stop thinking about the one that got away. It has been years since we've talked and yet I feel like this- wondering what if?  One night while drinking with my friends I got the balls to reach out to him (the one who got away). I tried to rekindle our relationship and at first he was for it. He was a bit hesitant and still had a wall up which was understandable, but gradually he was letting me in. We decided we were going to take it slow and we were not girlfriend and boyfriend yet, but I was happy and content with how it was going. I was growing as a person in different aspects of my life and wanted him to be apart of it all. Sometime later that month I went hiking with my best friend that I call Main Squeeze, babe, bae all of the above (she‚Äôs been my bestie since middle school). We were making it a habit of going hiking every weekend. One Saturday when we went hiking, I posted on Twitter \"going hiking with bae\" & he saw it and immediately unfollowed me and ghosted me. l know from his perspective it seemed wrong, but I was seriously hiking with my best friend. Looking back now obvi that was stupid to do but I was young and dumb. Me being young, dumb and immature, I didn't think to reach out to him and I just let it be. I was being stubborn that he unfollowed me and left it as is. I never got to explain myself or tell him that it was only my best friend I was hiking with. Here I am 8 years later still thinking of him and now he was the one that got away. I keep thinking of where life could've taken us & how happy we could've been. It makes me sad because I want him to see the person that I am today, (grown with an education, car own place etc), I still have things I can work on & those are all materialistic things but I have worked so hard for the person I am today. I‚Äôm so proud of the woman I am today and wish he could be apart of this chapter of my life. Maybe a year or two after that incident I reached out to him through text. At that time he was in a relationship so he just responded with \" maybe you shouldn't be texting me lol\" I said OK and left it as is. Fast forward to today they are no longer together, that relationship did not last long and as far as I know he is single. I brought this up to my therapist and she encouraged me to maybe reach out now to just express my feelings and where I'm at right now, to do it now while we're single and not committed to anything. She said that might be easier because time will pass and if I wait for more time for us to be in committed relationships or even married with a family to then even think about reaching out will be difficult. So should I do it? Should I reach out? I don't want to be a bother. I don't want to be a fool or make a fool of myself. Should I just let it be and continue to live my life how l've been? It has been years since we've talked and yet I feel like this wondering what if?"},

I was using crack and heroin and fentanyl and I decided \"yo that's enough this has gone way to far I need to stop\". So after rehab and Suboxone maintenance here I am, 70 something days sober. But before I got clean I met this girl and me and her hit it off pretty well. I decided that I'd stop the random sex with strangers with my drug habit since honestly that usually went hand and hand. Now I want to say I've done my fair share of drugs and I will always have a special place in my heart for psychedelics. That's the one thing I'll probably always do, and maybe ecstasy on very special occasions. I also am a huge fan and supporter of DMT. With that said me and girl spend a lot of time together and she's actually the first person I fell in love with. Like from the moment we first hung out we hit it off like no one I've ever met. It feels like I've always known her. And my favorite thing to do with her is hug... I know it sounds dumb but like for real, I love sex, I love kissing her, I love making her feel special, but like I REAAAALY love just hugging her. She gives the best hugs and they make me feel AMAZING. Last night we hugged for a solid 30 or 40 minutes. Just on the beach under the cloudy moon lit sky. Dancing and stumbling all over the cool sand but never breaking our embrace. Hardcore hugging, like full on face buried in shoulder standing in the rain hugging. She holds me like she never wants to let go. And tbh I don't ever want her to! Keep in mind that I'm sober, but I felt kinda like I'm rolling, but not as intense but still like it was crazy. I actually feel high when I'm hugging her. Before I met her I was sure that nothing could make me feel as good as heroin, but then she came along. Things are going so well we're just in total bliss. I never let anyone in like this, I've never felt like this, Ill love this girl till death."},

I love listening to him, and he enjoys telling stories, so I laid there with my blanket wrapped around me, listening to him tell me different sweet and happy stories. I felt so comfortable and safe in that moment, like nothing could go wrong. It was such a warm, nice feeling. I told him this, saying how safe, comfortable, and happy I felt. In response, he started saying such kind things. He told me things like: \"You're safe now.\" \"I won't let anything hurt you.\" and \"You can rest now.\" I've never been told anything like this before. My whole life, I've been used to abuse and hurt. To hear such simple yet kind sentences as these... shook me to my core. I started crying. Words like that were so foreign. They didn't feel like words I was meant to hear, yet he was telling me them. He began comforting me as I wept softly, but I was mainly holding back. I've never been good at crying in front of anyone. I made a small, joking comment through the tears like, \"I wonder how much I'd cry if I didn't hold back.\" In response, he told me not to hold back, and to just let myself cry and feel the emotions. And so I did. Crying has always been a painful thing for me. When I cry, there's a genuine pain deep in my stomach and it makes me cry out both from the sheer mental pain and from the physical pain. It's like the deep hurt I have bottled up takes physical form. Yet this crying was... gentle. There was no pain, no crying out. Just... happiness. I've never cried happy tears for anything, but in that moment, with the tears streaming down my face and clouding my eyes, that's all I felt. As I listened to his soothing voice tell me everything was going to be okay and that he wouldn't let anything hurt me, I was genuinely happy. For almost 2 hours afterward, I sobbed as he told me these kind words. I think a part of me healed that night. The part that didn't think it would ever be possible for me to be treated with this kind of kindness and love. The part of me who didn't think I deserved any. And all I felt was relief. Relief both at so much built up pain being alleviated that night, and at the fact that I have someone who loves me enough to help me deal with this pain. It was that night that I realized just how much I really loved him. There's nobody else I'd rather spend the rest of my life with, and I know he's the amazing man I'll marry some day."},

We have been together 'officially' for a very quick seven months but have always had a flirtatiuos relationship with each other from the start. I remember the first time I saw him I thought he was so attractive, everyone else who knew him was so excited to see him so he seemed very friendly and personable. Fast-forward to where we are at now and I could have never imagined my life turning out like it is now. I stay with him about 90% of the time and every time I look at him I want to physically cry from how happy I am. I can't remember the last time I have felt this genuinely happy. I recently went through a bad concussion that affected my blood pressure (weird, I know) and I could barely even walk ten feet without nearly passing out which meant I couldn't work out like I'm use to and that was super hard for me. I spent so much time crying from stress/pain and all that and he never left my side if he didn't have to. He was overly caring and I had never felt so loved in my life. His parents were even calling to check in on me and I had never felt like a partner's parents had cared so much. Everytime I look at my bf I am amazed at how lucky I got to be with him. I love watching him play his video games and seeing him so happy. His laugh is the best sound to me and he always hold me so tightly. I love going with him to run little errands because I love being able to be seen with him in public. He will always give me butterflies and I have never felt my heart so full for someone. I just wanted to tell someone/anyone/everyone about how happy I am because I am so in love and can't wait to marry this man and grow our own little family!"},

My girlfriend and I have been together for a little over 6 months and have known each other for a year. Due to it being her sister's birthday and a holiday the following week, I decided to plan a celebration this weekend. I made her a little trailer to advertise our anniversary. I used the Black Widow trailer and near the end, it cuts to me with a photo collage of us together and advertising our two-night event. The first night was okay, the internet made the video quality of our video call grainy and it kept cutting in and out. Even with that, I sent her the mixtape I made her (with songs that we both shared) and she loved it! Okay, moving on to the big event. Yesterday was our big event and after discussing our relationship and how far we've come, she told me she had a surprise for me at 11:59pm. Woah. I told her I did too (maybe a mistake on my part because she was expecting something, DARN IT!!!) and we danced, watched a movie and played games to pass the time. So, at 12:01am, after freshening up in the bathroom we got to the bathroom. I got back to the phone and after a little pause, she says \"I kinda, sorta, am 100% in love with you.\" She sent me her beautiful gift and I was happy! Then, I asked if it was my turn to share with her and she said yes. I prepared a four page speech (which was going to actually be a letter, but I just decided to read it to her). In the letter, it was very personal and heartfelt. I told her I love her. She, teary-eyed, paused and said...\"I love you too.\" I cried, we all cried. It was sooooo beautiful. She then said \"I knew since February.\" *sobs* We spent the rest of the night talking about the ways we were planning on saying it. Then we went to sleep at the same time, we didn't hang up and we woke up and continued the conversation. I will never forget this special moment. Thank you so much, V. I love you so much!

{"Title": "I‚Äôm thinking of ending my marriage of nearly two decades", "Author": "Unknown author", "Content": "I met the love of my life, knew I was going to marry her from the moment I saw her. Fought for her and married her less than a year later. My life was complete. I was the happiest guy on earth. This lasted for 10 years where I knew we had the kind of bond you see in movies. Nothing could ever tear us apart. It was us against the world. Then we decided to start a family. Immediately after she gave birth her whole demeanour towards me changed overnight. Gone were the constant moments of affection, the closeness we had on a daily basis, the sex, everything. I put it down to hormonal changes as giving birth is a big ordeal after all, and I gave her time. Lots of time. When after 3 years nothing changed, I sat her down and told her how I felt and how she made me feel. Like I was a stranger in my own house. Like I was living with a room mate who were only acquaintances with no romantic ties, hell without a proper friendship. I was expecting her to say she didn‚Äôt feel the same about me anymore, but to my surprise she said she hadn‚Äôt noticed!! She said she would try harder, and that was that. Nothing changed and we continued our surreal coexistence where nothing made sense to me. I suggested we see a marriage councillor to try and help. At first she agreed, but when d-day arrived she refused to take part. Fast forward another 3 years and I‚Äôm at my wits end. Unconditional love has turned into resentment. Joyful moments throughout the day where we exchanged a kiss or a touch or even a look has turned into a depressing nightmare for me where I feel utterly rejected and useless as a husband. I feel like the only reason I‚Äôm still needed is when I have to do things for her. Like fix her car, or build her some furniture or run errands. I don‚Äôt get anything in return that makes it feel worthwhile to be married to her anymore. I don‚Äôt ask for much. All I want is my wife back, to feel wanted and loved. But I‚Äôm getting nothing. At this point the resentment has grown so much that I don‚Äôt think I could trust it even if she magically decided to treat me like she used to. So here I am contemplating ending our marriage. Not because there‚Äôs someone else. I don‚Äôt know if I could ever trust anyone else. All I know is I will be happier on my own because I won‚Äôt be reminded every day of what my life used to be like. The only thing stopping me is our daughter. She is the light of my life and I would rather be unhappy so she doesn‚Äôt have to be. She loves us both equally and she knows something is up because she is forever trying to bring us closer together, even though she‚Äôs only 6. People say it‚Äôs better for kids if break up with your partner than be in a toxic relationship around them. And I agree. The only thing is we are perfectly pleasant towards one another. We never fight or scream and shout. My wife seems perfectly happy with the current arrangement as she is always on a high. And I would be over the moon for her, but not at my expense and my happiness. I‚Äôm thinking I should give this a final chance and say to her I‚Äôm about to end it unless she agrees to some councilling, to see if this marriage can be saved. Other than that I don‚Äôt see what other options I have but to walk out of this marriage. Love was always enough for me. It was my only requirement, and without it I have no reason to stay. If anyone has any insight or went through something similar I would be grateful for a bit of guidance as it scares the shit out of me."},

{"Title": "My Fianc√© Stole $40 From Me‚Ä¶ But It‚Äôs Not What You Think.", "Author": "u/New_Sea344", "Content": "It‚Äôs not what you think. This happened early on in our relationship, a little under four years ago. When we met my guy was starting his recovery from a serious meth addiction and as you can imagine I didn‚Äôt want to be involved with that, at all. So even though we had a serious connection I kept turning him down because I didn‚Äôt want to take any chances there, but after about six months of getting to know him I finally broke down and kissed him. We got together, and things were great. Then about six more months into our relationship there was one bad day where he wasn‚Äôt acting like himself and he was out hanging out with some guys I didn‚Äôt know, and I ended up finding $40 missing from my bank account. When I confronted him about it he admitted what he‚Äôd done. And I took my time to think about what that meant to me, because obviously I couldn‚Äôt just ignore what had happened. I definitely wasn‚Äôt going to just sit there and let him do things like that, to me or to himself. I wasn‚Äôt going to be an enabler and I wasn‚Äôt going to tie myself to that. So I took him and sat him down. And I explained that I knew he was recovering from a serious addiction and because of that I was going to forgive him for what had happened. And I also explained that I would give him two years. I wouldn‚Äôt commit to anything serious in that time, but if he could stay completely clean and sober it would show me that he was serious about our relationship. And to show him I was just as serious, I said that if he could do that, I would marry him. Now, four years later, he‚Äôs still completely sober and we‚Äôre engaged and I can say without a doubt that giving him a second chance that night was absolutely the best decision I have ever made. He is the love of my life. He never hesitates to tell me how beautiful I am or how much he loves me, and when I‚Äôm feeling bad he always does everything he possibly can to make me feel better.

I met my partner two months later. My partner is the love of my life -- the best man I've ever met. We fell in love within two or three weeks of meeting, and our love continues to grow. He is an amazing partner! He shows his love in ways I never dreamed possible (including bringing me breakfast in bed a couple of times a week). Tonight we were working here in the study. We each have a computer in here, and there is also a bed for napping. Just before I moved here two months ago, he set up Apple Home using Siri. One of Siri's skills is to play music all over the house when we ask her to. As we are both working at our computers, listening to music, the song \"In the Arms of the Angels\" starts to play. My wonderful, loving partner knew that song would trigger intense grief in me and make me cry. As soon as it started playing, he stood up, came to my computer, put his arms around me and said, \"Come on, let's go snuggle.\" I was already crying. My partner led me to the bed, pulled me into his arms, told Siri to stop the music, held me, and talked to me about my son until I stopped crying. I have never felt so loved. I love this man more than he can imagine. I know without a doubt that he feels the same."},
{"Title": "I find emotional intimacy difficult in many ways. Many people seem to want to hide who they are.", "Author": "u/Objective-Candle3478", "Content": "I do get the feeling that nowadays what leads to a big issue with relationships is, on one hand so many people just want to be loved for who they truly are. But then on the other those very same individuals get too scared/timid to actually let others in on real emotionally intimate level. How can someone be loved unconditionally if they don't show who they truly are to others? When I say this I mean, their fears, insecurities, and doubts in the moment as well as the positives. So many go out their way to protect their own ego that they hurt those willing to want to love them for who they are. I do think a lot is because of issues with perfectionism and what it means to be attractive. It's scary to actually put yourself truly on the line like that. But by doing so makes you a fantasticaslly strong individual. To accept and understand that you are a perfectly imperfect individual takes a lot of strength, and through that strength is being vulnerable you can have a chance at unconditional love. What are your thoughts?"},

I just really want to say how proud I am of her. I‚Äôm proud everything she‚Äôs been able to achieve; before we met and after we met. I look at the casual photos I love taking of her and I think she‚Äôs so sexy, so inspiring, so beautiful, and so intelligent. She‚Äôs off the radar bro. She‚Äôs crazy to think she‚Äôs ugly if she really believes that. I seriously love this women. I love to see her laugh. I love when it‚Äôs me making her laugh. I love the way she walks. I even love when she‚Äôs nagging, I don‚Äôt mean it in any disrespectful way. For example, when she tries to convince me to take cab home instead of walking home at night and she‚Äôs super serious but I still decide to walk home, because overall I live like 15 blocks away lol. I love her nose. I love her big eyes. I love her hair. I love her forehead. I love the smudged oval  birthmark on the right side of her face. I love when shes eating. I love her fingernails. I love her toes. I love her belly. I love her family to because they are good people. I love when the hairs on her legs are growing. I love her kisses when she use to give me some. I super love her hugs and when it lasts for more than 10 seconds. I love her style. I love her charisma. I love how funny she is. I love her principles. I love her dog. I literally can go on and on. I love how she just a boss. I love her being anal about having matching sheets. I love how she‚Äôs always trying to evolve. From upgrading her standard toothbrush to an electric one üò≠ or just taking care of herself and her needs. Shit I love she broke up with me because I totally respect that and respect her. At this point, i think I can care less if she gets back with me. It would hurt, yes, if she decided to move on entirely and we don‚Äôt talk anymore but part of me is just so grateful to be in her presence still and show her, even though we are friends, how much I still appreciate her.

{"Title": "For 30 Years, I loved with contempt. My ex wife despised me.", "Author": "u/saffermaster", "Content": "After a few years licking my wounds, I put myself out there at age 55, trying to find love. I spent 4 years enjoying kinky sex with women of every age. From 18 to 60. Nothing I did could fill the emptiness I felt in my broken heart. One woman I dated shared with me that in spite of my sense of failure, that she found me imminently lovable. Another lover told me that I am too distant and \"You need to let me in,\" I went out and got a tattoo on my chest that took 7 months to complete. It captured my sense that attraction was possible, that there was a certain randomity to the world, that we lived in an endless universe and that I am lovable. Its a cool trash punk tattoo. I looked hard at what was missing from my marriage. It occurred to me that intimacy was missing. One day I got a message from a woman on a kink site who saw my \"seeking post\". She was as kinky as me and also looking for intimacy and we started a dialogue. We courted for 6 months before we began our dynamic formally. That was 6 years ago. in 6 days I am going to marry her. I could not be happier. We not only found love, we fell in love and have had a steamy love affair that goes on and on. I am so here for it. Its possible to find love. I can guarantee that there is love after divorce. My life is poetry. Update: Kink is interesting. People of all ages participate. There are kids who learn about kink at a very young age, and are perhaps more ready to explore kink when they get to age 18 than others are till much later in life. One thing about being Dom in a kink setting like a club or munch is that submissives of all ages and genders approach you and negotiate a scene with you. Remember, all kink is based on consent, not persuasion, informed enthusiastic consent. I should have noted that I practice RACK which is Risk-Aware Consensual Kink, and SSC, Safe, Sane Consensual Kink. I get the idea that morality has it that young adults should not play with old adults, but that is simply your own ick, nobody else's. We have a saying in kink, \"I'm not going to yuck on your yum\""},

We made our relationship official in April, so I like to think we took it pretty slow. In every other relationship I have ever had, I felt the need to be so careful about my body, my choices, and never felt at home with my partners. I always was waiting for the next step of where I was going to go to next. I made sure that we used multiple forms of protection when we were intimate. I never felt like I could be my sensitive, extroverted self fully. Before we became romantic, he helped me pass the final course I needed for my first degree. I had been calling my \"Rave Husband\", because we were always attached at the hip at the many raves we stuffed into a year. He spent the day with me after I had emergency surgery, just so I wouldn't be alone. He is one of the only people that has ever made an effort to celebrate my birthday. He got out of his car when I did, because he thought he was going to have to pull me off of some guy in front of a bar, and still decided to want me. He watched me projectile vomit outside of a show in 100 degree weather, and left early with me, and cuddled me while I looked like a drowned sewer rat months long before he declared his feelings. With this man??? I told this man today that I trust him enough to decide when and if he ever wants to put a baby in me. I told this man that I would provide for him whatever he desires in this world and then more. I made this man know I intend on marrying him and making sure that he smiles every day for the rest of his life. I let this man do things to me today that I would have never allowed anyone else do. Suddenly, just like magic, I would give him everything I am and still be searching for more to give him. Every day, I find out more about him that makes my love grow even bigger. I sat in my bedroom for hours today waiting for him to call on his work break, in shock with myself at the words that had come out of my mouth to him before he had left. Never in my life have I been down this bad for someone. Every day it gets worse. I grieve for the time in this life that I won't get to spend with him. I have never wanted to just spend a day laying around with someone. It's like I have been possessed. Somehow, I have known my best friend for over a year now and the love I have for him only continues to grow exponentially with time that I fear I may one day explode. SOS"},

Your actions are louder than words, yet I think maybe you did not love me much as you thought. It‚Äôs fine, I just hate to think I‚Äôm not your person and you aren‚Äôt mine.

The feeling of new love is so euphoric, I just have to share. We have decided not to put a label on what we have going on, so I don‚Äôt consider her my girlfriend by any means. I broke up with an ex of 1 year about a month and a half ago, and since about 4 weeks ago, me and this girl have been talking more than before, and hanging out. I never even thought about flirting or making a move, because I was in the process of getting out of a relationship I felt stuck in. More than anyone else, she helped me understand what was wrong with my relationship and would always give pointers on how to make relationships more successful. I had given up on love. For months before I broke up with my ex, me and this girl talked all the time about love. I explained to her many many times that I‚Äôve lost faith in relationships. My ex of 5 years cheated on me along with physical abuse. My ex after that started acting like my other ex(very violent) and I decided that no one should ever feel threatened by their partner, even if they haven‚Äôt taken a swing yet. This girl explained to me that life is about taking chances and dating shouldn‚Äôt be ruled out just yet. Always kind of hinting at the thought of us being together. I work as a CNA in a long term care facility and she does the same PRN. We don‚Äôt work together much, but everytime we have, it seems like every one of our coworkers seem to think we were together. It‚Äôs not just our coworkers, the residents we take care of hint at it and tease us both about dating each other. A week or so after I broke up with my ex, I was on the phone with her. We talked about what went wrong and why I had bad luck with dating before. She kept expressing to not lose hope. The next day we worked together and while we were changing residents/doing vitals etc, she kept sort of bumping into me. She would stand really close when we talked and never took her eye off me. I knew what was happening and I wasn‚Äôt about to let my insecurities pass this off. We started talking about taking it super slow in a relationship being the best choice. She mentions she wouldn‚Äôt mind doing something like that and I say the same. To hang out, talk all the time, whatever couples do, just not labeling it. We figure that‚Äôs the best way to do things, except that we‚Äôve already knew each other for 11 months that I‚Äôve been working with her and have became very good friends. When she brings this up I knew for a fact that she wanted to go out with me, so I asked her if she wanted to come have some drinks and watch some movies at my house. She very quickly agreed and we made a date to hang out. When the time comes, she shows up at my house, like an hour late(she had a good excuse) and we start talking. We put on a movie but not a second of it was watched. We just talked and talked. I knew I couldn‚Äôt chicken out and not make a move, and I also knew that with her being very shy, there was no way she was going to make a move. Everytime I got up from the couch to grab another beer or make her a drink, I would sit closer and closer when I got back to the couch. At this point I‚Äôve had 2 or 3 beers and I was starting to feel my intuition slip away. Even if she tells me she doesn‚Äôt like me like that, I‚Äôll be able to defend my actions and apologize, so what‚Äôs to lose? I had this overwhelming feeling that I misunderstood all of our talks and all the hints, all the things residents and coworkers have said. I felt like she wasn‚Äôt comfortable and that I was going to make a big mistake if I were to make a move.  After making her a drink and sitting down right next to her, were our arms are touching, I throw my arm around her and she sinks into me, holding me, like she‚Äôs been waiting 11 months for this. I‚Äôve never felt so exhilarated in my life. I figured I‚Äôve got it in the bag, so I lean in to kiss her and she grabs my face and pulls it closer. We ended up making out for quite some time before she had to leave for work in the morning. I felt very very happy about this and high on life. Within a couple days we had already set up another time for us to hang out. I decided we should go on a hike, then back to my house. That was very successful as well and I felt like there was nothing stopping us from continuing this. She‚Äôs been on vacation for the last 2 weeks but we plan to go camping next Wednesday and Thursday on an island. We have so much in common and she is absolutely stunning. I can‚Äôt mess this up, but I at least know for sure that even if it doesn‚Äôt work out, we will still be great friends. Thank you for all that came to listen , have a great day!"},

We‚Äôve been dating for almost 3 years (anniversary in July). For 2.5 of them, we were online. Online relationships are hard. He‚Äôs in South Carolina, I was in Maryland. I decided to move to him. On the way down, on January 31st, literally 40 minutes away, my mom fell asleep at the wheel and we crashed into the moving van (she was going to drop me off, as she herself was moving to Florida with my youngest sibling. Other sibling stayed with Dad in Maryland for college.) I was the only one moderately injured in the wreck (thank God) and was taken to the hospital in an ambulance. I told my boyfriend where. He met me there. I saw my boyfriend in person for the first time while on a hospital bed. The first few months were rough for me to settle in. 21 years in Maryland in the same area my whole life was hard to transition from. My boyfriend was with me every step of the way. March was the anniversary of the deaths of several people who were important to me in my youth. They died in a car crash when I was a young teen. In Maryland, every year I would go to the playground we all played at on their deathiversary, since none of them were buried (all cremated to my knowledge). My boyfriend drove me the 500 miles to go back to Maryland to be at that playground. In April, I had a breast reduction surgery. The recovery for that was rough‚Äî for the first two weeks, I couldn‚Äôt reach my middle well enough to use the bathroom. This man wiped my pee for me, and once the anesthesia wore off, my poop too. I got my period in the second week. He learned how to put a tampon in me and take it out. He was by my side the whole time. The breast reduction was done in Maryland and we stayed with my father for a week. I‚Äôve only seen my father cry three times: when our cat died, at the end of Star Wars (because ‚Äúit‚Äôs so happy, they got the medals they worked so hard for‚Äù üíÄ), and when my boyfriend and I left. My father said he‚Äôs a good man and he‚Äôs so happy for us. He also gave him $400 to ‚Äúpay him back‚Äù for medical expenses. My boyfriend ended up using the remainder on a date with me. Speaking of dates. I love notebooks and pens; my boyfriend doesn‚Äôt really care about those. Yet he took me on a date to Staples and Michaels, I thought to window shop but he bought so much for me. He also gets me some model skulls that I collect when he sees a cool one. Shortly after I moved in, he came home with one meant for an aquarium: ‚ÄúI thought of you.‚Äù I cried. We went to MomoCon this year, and he cosplayed with me. We went as Leon and Ada from the Resident Evil series (specifically the RE4 remake). He waited in line for Digimon and Pok√©mon voice actors with me and listened to me rant about the characters I like. We‚Äôre getting married next year. We aren‚Äôt conventionally engaged yet‚Äî he has something planned but won‚Äôt tell me‚Äî but we know we‚Äôre getting married. We just haven‚Äôt told our families yet.

I was in a temporary situation with someone and before it started we both agreed it had a countdown because we both would be moving to very different places quite soon and there's little to no chance of crossing paths after. All was understood and glad this was clear and upfront, but after it ended I came to a strange realization. Compared to all flings or real relationships (some more healthy/successful than others) I've had in the past it was the most authentic affection I've received so far. And the most I've wanted to give affection in return. I'm not particularly sad or regretful in any way cause I knew the conditions, but I'm startled that I can confidently say a less than two month fling felt more honest and caring than any previous entanglement had. I don't think it's because it is more fresh in my mind, just to state. I guess I just always felt like I did more or more was always expected from me than was ever given. I guess I'm wondering how it's possible that the most mature and earnest experience of positive emotional expression (non-platonic) I've had so far came from something so simple and short lived ?"},

{"Title": "One week since we went no contact, a letter I wish I could send", "Author": "u/slenderfingerz", "Content": "My sweet boy, Not a minute goes past where you don't cross my mind. The tears on your face as we said I love you for the last time are forever imprinted in my memory. You don't know how badly I wanted to wipe them away, kiss your forehead, and promise you it would be okay. I knew I couldn't, because then I would never get out of your car. I've been trying to keep myself busy. Started going to the gym every day instead of every other. It hasn't really helped too much, but it's nice to keep my mind off you for a few hours. I stare at my bare ring finger more often than I should. I still instinctively go to grab my ring off my dresser when I wake up every morning, even though it's not there anymore. Everything makes me think of you. The cicadas chirping makes me think of us laughing when you told me they keep getting caught in your windshield. The news reminds me of our long drives where we would discuss politics and everything going on in the world. Every outfit I put on reminds me of when I would wear it with you. Inside Out 2 comes out in two days! I hope you're as excited as I am. I know we've been planning for months on watching it together on opening night. A part of me wonders if we'll be watching it at the same time at different theatres, laughing and crying at the same parts of it. Honestly, I'm probably just going to cry through this whole thing as I wish you were by my side while I watch. Maybe I'll wait to see it until I feel ready. I hope you still get to see it, though. I can't stop living in the \"what ifs\" of it all. What could have been different, what could have changed. I yearn for you. My heart feels half empty. I know it's unhealthy to live in the past, but the only way I've been able to fall asleep at night is when I replay our old memories in our head. Even then, I wake up in the middle of the night gasping and imagining the past few days have just been some fucked up nightmare. I had to mute your number, because every time my phone buzzed, deep down I hoped it was you. Even still, I find myself constantly looking at the little red numbers above the texting app, hoping it goes up by one. The amount of times I dialed your number just to not hit call is pathetic. I just need to hear your voice. I know this yearning is unhealthy, but I don't know when it will go away. I miss your smile, and the way your nose scrunches when you're really happy. I miss your silky black hair and your mocha skin. I miss your dark brown eyes that I would constantly get lost in. I miss your touch and I miss your kisses. I miss feeling the tightness when you squeeze me when we hug. I miss hearing your heart beat when I rest my head on your chest. I remember the first time I ever did that way back when we first staring dating and I could feel it racing, it made me blush. I miss your gentle voice and your roaring laugh. I miss our deep talks and our petty gossip. I even miss our fights, as dumb as that sounds. I just miss everything. It's been hard to scroll through social media because anytime I see something that reminds me of you, I want to send it to you. I've been sending them to my own number instead. In fact, to be honest, I've been texting my own number a lot. Whenever I want to text you, I just text it to myself. It still cuts like glass when the message immediately bounces back. Anyway, my eyes are getting misty so I'll stop here. Goodbye, my love. Maybe in another life, we'll do things right. I love you infinity plus one, ha I win."},

It's everywhere and there seems to be something about it I'm not grasping. I don't understand people who make their partner responsible for everything that goes about them. They're they're own person too. I feel like that would be too much pressure on someone. I don't understand \"romantic expectations\" like sex or how your life goal according to society should be to get in a romantic relationship. I don't understand so much about \"love\" or affection, at least now how society views it, and I want to understand. I have a partner and I care about them very much. I feel about them differently than I do other people. I'd be okay sharing a life with them and doing things together. But, I don't feel that strong desire for certain romantic things. I love sending them gifts, calling them, and doing things together. I love being there for them and comforting them. I'm always proud of them.

We sat down briefly and she showed me how they‚Äôd carefully wrapped it in tissue paper for her. As we drove home I just remember her telling me how comfortable it was when she tried it on , how the sales assistant had made her feel positive about it, and how special it made her feel.

I've gone back and forth on if I should tell this story, but I'm a writer at heart and putting thoughts and emotions to words is how I work through it all, and maybe someone will read this and feel something, also so all the kids out there know that love is never simple, and you are bound to get caught up in it even well into your adult years. So back in January I met lets call her N, and we instantly connected. Like she called me the night after our coffee date to talk more, it was just so comfortable, we texted every day, called few times a week. Within a couple weeks we'd been on three more dates and made things official, after that we spent every weekend either at her place or mine, and occasionally got together during the week too. N and I have a dozen things in common, specific video games, humor, movies, and even our obscure fashion and interior design choices match. We shared personal, private pains. Before two months were up she had told me she loved me, I'd told her I was getting there, I had met her friends more than once, and we both had told our parents about each other. It seemed like a beautiful beginning. But then it ended suddenly. She had a bout of insecurities and she felt like she didn't deserve me, I couldn't convince her I was happy with her, and she ended things. But neither of us wanted the other out of our lives. We continued to talk every day, call each other, and we still regularly got together in person. After more than a month it looked from my side like we could start again, but N had an old long distance friend. This guy had never been too happy we were dating, and had decided now was a good time to come down and see N for the first time in years. I had an opportunity to tell N how I truly felt before he showed up, N and I had gone out drinking the night before he arrived, and though she showed doubt about what she wanted from her old friend, there was wonder too. So rather than throw an emotional bomb at her the night before, I kept my silence. I told her a week later, though I knew she had decided to be with him. I told her, not to confuse or ask anything of her, simply because she deserved to know. Her old insecurities had been wrong, and I still wanted to be a part of her life. She was not happy. Mad that I had taken so long to feel what she had felt months earlier, mad that I hadn't said anything that last night, mad that she thought I was only pretending to be friends, and even still insecure that I could still want someone like her in my life. That was only a month ago, and to this day we talk everyday, call at least once a week, and see each other nearly every week. We are both excited for an upcoming con, a game release later this year, and she expressed wanting to go to renn faire with me still. She is fast becoming my best friend, and I honestly am so happy I met her, I don't regret a thing. I don't know what the future holds, I'm casually looking for another partner, but mainly on bettering myself. We may or may not ever get back together, but I hope that in five years we are still talking every day, and getting together once a week to see each other. Love is beautiful in all forms, even at times in heartbreak and lost potential."},

His smile makes my heart melt and I've never been more interested in what anyone has to say than when he's talking about something he's passionate about. I feel so safe in his presence and I sleep better with him than I ever have. We've been talking about getting married for the past couple months and he's confirmed that he plans on getting me an engagement ring soon, and with our anniversary coming up at the end of the month I feel like it'll be around then. Plus, I saw him looking up rings. And I'm so excited. Whether he does it now or later, I'm just happy to know I'll be spending the rest of my life with him. I don't care about a big wedding or anything like that. I just can't wait to call him my husband, and to hear him call me his wife. Love, in all forms, is what makes life truly worth living. Connection, and shared experiences. Self love. The love of being a parent, or being a child. Closeness with your family, or building your own chosen family. Friendships, marriages, and pets. This is what it's about. And I'm eternally grateful to be filled with an infinite amount of love, and especially grateful to feel it back. ‚ù§Ô∏è"},

I‚Äôve been seeing her for almost a year and I‚Äôm still anticipating someone popping out with a camera crew to let me know it‚Äôs all been a set up, but it never happens. I tried dating apps and asking people out for the better part of a decade not really feeling much of a connection or finding a spark that fizzled out quickly. In the last couple years I realized I was asexual. The general population is less than 1% ace, and of that one percent you‚Äôre lucky if you find 1 or 2 people you have something in common with. When I saw her dating profile I was floored. Someone who was more like me than anyone I‚Äôd ever seen on any dating app, ace, and incredibly beautiful. We hit it off pretty quickly through text chat and quickly moved to phone calls. We have similar niche hobbies, asthetics, work in the same industry, similar off brand humor, politics, values, and so many more things. She‚Äôs hilarious, nerdy, an incredible artist talented beyond her years, jaw dropping beautiful, smart, affectionate and caring. I have so many overwhelming feelings about her and our time together so far, like on our first date when she held my arm as we drunkenly walked the city streets looking at an festival market and playing ski ball together at the arcade, or our second date having a picnic in the botanical gardens, looking at all the Christmas lights in town til dark and doing star gazing. It‚Äôs been almost a year of dating and every one we go one seems impossibly magical  putting rom coms to shame. We spend a few evenings each week playing board games online, cracking jokes and telling each other about what‚Äôs going on in our lives.

We had mutuals so we would come around each other when our friends had kickbacks etc. I began to pursue him because I thought he was cute and liked him. Eventually he showed me that he reciprocated so we began to date and go out. We would go to sports games out to dinners & he would come over often to swim etc.  we had a real strong connection and all- This all happened so fast, but we were young and in love. even though I wanted him to make me his girlfriend he never did because he didn't know that I wanted that. Eventually I got back with my ex & we decided to stay as \"friends\". Obviously the relationship with my ex didn't work out and we ended up breaking up indefinitely. I continued to live my life, but I couldn't help but not being able to stop thinking about the one that got away. It has been years since we've talked and yet I feel like this- wondering what if?  One night while drinking with my friends I got the balls to reach out to him (the one who got away). I tried to rekindle our relationship and at first he was for it. He was a bit hesitant and still had a wall up which was understandable, but gradually he was letting me in. We decided we were going to take it slow and we were not girlfriend and boyfriend yet, but I was happy and content with how it was going. I was growing as a person in different aspects of my life and wanted him to be apart of it all. Sometime later that month I went hiking with my best friend that I call Main Squeeze, babe, bae all of the above (she‚Äôs been my bestie since middle school). We were making it a habit of going hiking every weekend. One Saturday when we went hiking, I posted on Twitter \"going hiking with bae\" & he saw it and immediately unfollowed me and ghosted me. l know from his perspective it seemed wrong, but I was seriously hiking with my best friend. Looking back now obvi that was stupid to do but I was young and dumb. Me being young, dumb and immature, I didn't think to reach out to him and I just let it be. I was being stubborn that he unfollowed me and left it as is. I never got to explain myself or tell him that it was only my best friend I was hiking with. Here I am 8 years later still thinking of him and now he was the one that got away. I keep thinking of where life could've taken us & how happy we could've been. It makes me sad because I want him to see the person that I am today, (grown with an education, car own place etc), I still have things I can work on & those are all materialistic things but I have worked so hard for the person I am today. I‚Äôm so proud of the woman I am today and wish he could be apart of this chapter of my life. Maybe a year or two after that incident I reached out to him through text. At that time he was in a relationship so he just responded with \" maybe you shouldn't be texting me lol\" I said OK and left it as is. Fast forward to today they are no longer together, that relationship did not last long and as far as I know he is single. I brought this up to my therapist and she encouraged me to maybe reach out now to just express my feelings and where I'm at right now, to do it now while we're single and not committed to anything. She said that might be easier because time will pass and if I wait for more time for us to be in committed relationships or even married with a family to then even think about reaching out will be difficult. So should I do it? Should I reach out? I don't want to be a bother. I don't want to be a fool or make a fool of myself. Should I just let it be and continue to live my life how l've been?

I was over that person and I was ready the date. But the funny thing was, I decided to hop on PlayStation with my two friends wanting to play a video game to just pass the time since at the time I was living with my parents and I was waiting to go to work because at the time I didn‚Äôt have my license. so we played a game of Fortnite and rocket league and I think we did fall guys. But then I was talking to one of my friends and I said dude this whole. PlayStation list of people on here is very bare meaning I don‚Äôt have any person. I only had like my family and a few coworkers on there. And my friends from school when I graduated. I said to my friend I wish there was a way that I can find people and be friends with and just play video games because at the time I was still in a dark place I needed somebody to talk to like my friends didn‚Äôt really talk to me about that stuff because sometimes they would get annoyed And would not talk to them about it. So I hopped on Reddit. I had an old account where I went on the sub, but I had to delete it because of stuff happened, which explain another time but I went on there scrolled a few to see if anybody was willing to play a video game. I met one person. they were from the states like I was we didn‚Äôt really play any games. We just talked on discord that was really about it. We were talking for about a few weeks and they were likely busy a lot so we didn‚Äôt really get much talking to and I didn‚Äôt really get to play with them on video games so I was a little bummed out about that so I scrolled again on that sub Reddit to look then I found the post that would change my life like seriously she made a post about wanting to find people to play video games. There was a few people on that. That asked her to play video games. They gave their usernames to her and I was one of the few that gave her mine because I said hey I‚Äôm a girl if that matters. After a bit, I hopped on PlayStation and played with my friends, and I got a notification. Saying the infamous line hey are you from Reddit? And I said yes I‚Äôm from Reddit. Are you that person that made that post and obviously I was thinking oh my God I‚Äôm so stupid. Yes of course that is. We started talking for a bit. She asked me are you from the UK and I said I‚Äôm actually from the United States we started talking a little bit and we didn‚Äôt play any games at first she actually ghosted me for a bit lol and after that she came back and we started playing a video games together, and she asked me if I had discord and I gave her my username to her so after that, we actually started talking a lot more and we actually had so much in common we played video games and after a while we actually started having feelings for each other when we were talking about this not long ago she said she was the first person to fall in love with me even though I was like wait really I was shocked because I was the first person that fell in love with her so now the rest is history it‚Äôs been going on for almost 2 years now me and her together in December. Thank you so much for reading this and I hope you find your person ‚ù§Ô∏è also sorry about the grammar. I‚Äôm using the voice chat my arms are hurting"},
{"Title": "A little story of how I met the girl I‚Äôve been talking to.", "Author": "u/Zealousideal_Ad321", "Content": "Sorry, this will be long, but very worth the read. The feeling of new love is so euphoric, I just have to share. We have decided not to put a label on what we have going on, so I don‚Äôt consider her my girlfriend by any means. I broke up with an ex of 1 year about a month and a half ago, and since about 4 weeks ago, me and this girl have been talking more than before, and hanging out. I never even thought about flirting or making a move, because I was in the process of getting out of a relationship I felt stuck in. More than anyone else, she helped me understand what was wrong with my relationship and would always give pointers on how to make relationships more successful. I had given up on love. For months before I broke up with my ex, me and this girl talked all the time about love. I explained to her many many times that I‚Äôve lost faith in relationships. My ex of 5 years cheated on me along with physical abuse. My ex after that started acting like my other ex(very violent) and I decided that no one should ever feel threatened by their partner, even if they haven‚Äôt taken a swing yet. This girl explained to me that life is about taking chances and dating shouldn‚Äôt be ruled out just yet. Always kind of hinting at the thought of us being together. I work as a CNA in a long term care facility and she does the same PRN. We don‚Äôt work together much, but everytime we have, it seems like every one of our coworkers seem to think we were together. It‚Äôs not just our coworkers, the residents we take care of hint at it and tease us both about dating each other. A week or so after I broke up with my ex, I was on the phone with her. We talked about what went wrong and why I had bad luck with dating before. She kept expressing to not lose hope. The next day we worked together and while we were changing residents/doing vitals etc, she kept sort of bumping into me. She would stand really close when we talked and never took her eye off me. I knew what was happening and I wasn‚Äôt about to let my insecurities pass this off. We started talking about taking it super slow in a relationship being the best choice. She mentions she wouldn‚Äôt mind doing something like that and I say the same. To hang out, talk all the time, whatever couples do, just not labeling it. We figure that‚Äôs the best way to do things, except that we‚Äôve already knew each other for 11 months that I‚Äôve been working with her and have became very good friends. When she brings this up I knew for a fact that she wanted to go out with me, so I asked her if she wanted to come have some drinks and watch some movies at my house. She very quickly agreed and we made a date to hang out. When the time comes, she shows up at my house, like an hour late(she had a good excuse) and we start talking. We put on a movie but not a second of it was watched. We just talked and talked. I knew I couldn‚Äôt chicken out and not make a move, and I also knew that with her being very shy, there was no way she was going to make a move. Everytime I got up from the couch to grab another beer or make her a drink, I would sit closer and closer when I got back to the couch. At this point I‚Äôve had 2 or 3 beers and I was starting to feel my intuition slip away. Even if she tells me she doesn‚Äôt like me like that, I‚Äôll be able to defend my actions and apologize, so what‚Äôs to lose? I had this overwhelming feeling that I misunderstood all of our talks and all the hints, all the things residents and coworkers have said. I felt like she wasn‚Äôt comfortable and that I was going to make a big mistake if I were to make a move.  After making her a drink and sitting down right next to her, were our arms are touching, I throw my arm around her and she sinks into me, holding me, like she‚Äôs been waiting 11 months for this. I‚Äôve never felt so exhilarated in my life. I figured I‚Äôve got it in the bag, so I lean in to kiss her and she grabs my face and pulls it closer. We ended up making out for quite some time before she had to leave for work in the morning. I felt very very happy about this and high on life. Within a couple days we had already set up another time for us to hang out. I decided we should go on a hike, then back to my house. That was very successful as well and I felt like there was nothing stopping us from continuing this. She‚Äôs been on vacation for the last 2 weeks but we plan to go camping next Wednesday and Thursday on an island. We have so much in common and she is absolutely stunning. I can‚Äôt mess this up, but I at least know for sure that even if it doesn‚Äôt work out, we will still be great friends. Thank you for all that came to listen , have a great day!"},

It's been a while since we last spoke, and I've been doing some reflecting lately & really for a long while now. There are memories we shared together that I still hold dear. I wanted to take a moment to reach out and check in on you. Life has its up and downs, but I often find myself thinking about the times we spent together and the joy it brought me. I know we've both moved on with our lives, but that doesn't diminish the significance of the impact you had on me. I just wanted you to know that I'm grateful for the time we had together even though short lived and the person you helped me become. Not to toot my own horn but I am pretty proud of the person I am today & in one way or another you had part into shaping who I am today. The last time I attempted to rekindle our relationship/friendship, I know it didn‚Äôt end well. There were some assumptions that were made and although rightfully so, I never had the chance to explain myself or explain the misunderstanding. It‚Äôs been such a long time since so it may be irrelevant today but I wanted to reach out nonetheless. If you ever feel like catching up or grabbing a coffee, I'd love to hear from you. But regardless, I wish you nothing but happiness and fulfillment in all that you do. I pray for you and will continue to pray for your wellbeing & happiness. Graciously, An Old Love"},

{"Title": "One week since we went no contact, a letter I wish I could send", "Author": "u/slenderfingerz", "Content": "My sweet boy, Not a minute goes past where you don't cross my mind. The tears on your face as we said I love you for the last time are forever imprinted in my memory. You don't know how badly I wanted to wipe them away, kiss your forehead, and promise you it would be okay. I knew I couldn't, because then I would never get out of your car. I've been trying to keep myself busy. Started going to the gym every day instead of every other. It hasn't really helped too much, but it's nice to keep my mind off you for a few hours. I stare at my bare ring finger more often than I should. I still instinctively go to grab my ring off my dresser when I wake up every morning, even though it's not there anymore. Everything makes me think of you. The cicadas chirping makes me think of us laughing when you told me they keep getting caught in your windshield. The news reminds me of our long drives where we would discuss politics and everything going on in the world. Every outfit I put on reminds me of when I would wear it with you. Inside Out 2 comes out in two days! I hope you're as excited as I am. I know we've been planning for months on watching it together on opening night. A part of me wonders if we'll be watching it at the same time at different theatres, laughing and crying at the same parts of it. Honestly, I'm probably just going to cry through this whole thing as I wish you were by my side while I watch. Maybe I'll wait to see it until I feel ready. I hope you still get to see it, though. I can't stop living in the \"what ifs\" of it all. What could have been different, what could have changed. I yearn for you. My heart feels half empty. I know it's unhealthy to live in the past, but the only way I've been able to fall asleep at night is when I replay our old memories in our head. Even then, I wake up in the middle of the night gasping and imagining the past few days have just been some fucked up nightmare. I had to mute your number, because every time my phone buzzed, deep down I hoped it was you. Even still, I find myself constantly looking at the little red numbers above the texting app, hoping it goes up by one. The amount of times I dialed your number just to not hit call is pathetic. I just need to hear your voice. I know this yearning is unhealthy, but I don't know when it will go away. I miss your smile, and the way your nose scrunches when you're really happy. I miss your silky black hair and your mocha skin. I miss your dark brown eyes that I would constantly get lost in. I miss your touch and I miss your kisses. I miss feeling the tightness when you squeeze me when we hug. I miss hearing your heart beat when I rest my head on your chest. I remember the first time I ever did that way back when we first staring dating and I could feel it racing, it made me blush. I miss your gentle voice and your roaring laugh. I miss our deep talks and our petty gossip. I even miss our fights, as dumb as that sounds. I just miss everything. It's been hard to scroll through social media because anytime I see something that reminds me of you, I want to send it to you. I've been sending them to my own number instead. In fact, to be honest, I've been texting my own number a lot. Whenever I want to text you, I just text it to myself. It still cuts like glass when the message immediately bounces back. Anyway, my eyes are getting misty so I'll stop here. Goodbye, my love. Maybe in another life, we'll do things right. I love you infinity plus one, ha I win."},

We drove there that evening, and I left her for half an hour to have a fitting appointment. I left her with my credit card and wandered around the shops for a while. I came back and waited outside the shop for her once it‚Äôd been about 25 minutes. She came out with the bra packaged inside a cord-handled bag. She was beaming with excitement. We sat down briefly and she showed me how they‚Äôd carefully wrapped it in tissue paper for her. As we drove home I just remember her telling me how comfortable it was when she tried it on , how the sales assistant had made her feel positive about it, and how special it made her feel. She told me the same thing a few times but I loved every moment of it. She‚Äôd never had a properly fitted bra before and it‚Äôs an experience that I think I enjoyed more just listening to how happy it made her ü•π"},

I was in a temporary situation with someone and before it started we both agreed it had a countdown because we both would be moving to very different places quite soon and there's little to no chance of crossing paths after. All was understood and glad this was clear and upfront, but after it ended I came to a strange realization. Compared to all flings or real relationships (some more healthy/successful than others) I've had in the past it was the most authentic affection I've received so far. And the most I've wanted to give affection in return. I'm not particularly sad or regretful in any way cause I knew the conditions, but I'm startled that I can confidently say a less than two month fling felt more honest and caring than any previous entanglement had. I don't think it's because it is more fresh in my mind, just to state. I guess I just always felt like I did more or more was always expected from me than was ever given. I guess I'm wondering how it's possible that the most mature and earnest experience of positive emotional expression (non-platonic) I've had so far came from something so simple and short lived ?"},

The person I turn to for comfort, for laughter. I love exploring our city together just as much as I love exploring new places together. I love the small things just as much as I love the big things. His smile makes my heart melt and I've never been more interested in what anyone has to say than when he's talking about something he's passionate about. I feel so safe in his presence and I sleep better with him than I ever have. We've been talking about getting married for the past couple months and he's confirmed that he plans on getting me an engagement ring soon, and with our anniversary coming up at the end of the month I feel like it'll be around then. Plus, I saw him looking up rings. And I'm so excited. Whether he does it now or later, I'm just happy to know I'll be spending the rest of my life with him. I don't care about a big wedding or anything like that. I just can't wait to call him my husband, and to hear him call me his wife. Love, in all forms, is what makes life truly worth living. Connection, and shared experiences. Self love. The love of being a parent, or being a child. Closeness with your family, or building your own chosen family. Friendships, marriages, and pets. This is what it's about. And I'm eternally grateful to be filled with an infinite amount of love, and especially grateful to feel it back. ‚ù§Ô∏è"},

I feel about them differently than I do other people. I'd be okay sharing a life with them and doing things together. But, I don't feel that strong desire for certain romantic things. I love sending them gifts, calling them, and doing things together. I love being there for them and comforting them. I'm always proud of them.

I've gone back and forth on if I should tell this story, but I'm a writer at heart and putting thoughts and emotions to words is how I work through it all, and maybe someone will read this and feel something, also so all the kids out there know that love is never simple, and you are bound to get caught up in it even well into your adult years. So back in January I met lets call her N, and we instantly connected. Like she called me the night after our coffee date to talk more, it was just so comfortable, we texted every day, called few times a week. Within a couple weeks we'd been on three more dates and made things official, after that we spent every weekend either at her place or mine, and occasionally got together during the week too. N and I have a dozen things in common, specific video games, humor, movies, and even our obscure fashion and interior design choices match. We shared personal, private pains. Before two months were up she had told me she loved me, I'd told her I was getting there, I had met her friends more than once, and we both had told our parents about each other. It seemed like a beautiful beginning. But then it ended suddenly. She had a bout of insecurities and she felt like she didn't deserve me, I couldn't convince her I was happy with her, and she ended things. But neither of us wanted the other out of our lives. We continued to talk every day, call each other, and we still regularly got together in person. After more than a month it looked from my side like we could start again, but N had an old long distance friend. This guy had never been too happy we were dating, and had decided now was a good time to come down and see N for the first time in years. I had an opportunity to tell N how I truly felt before he showed up, N and I had gone out drinking the night before he arrived, and though she showed doubt about what she wanted from her old friend, there was wonder too. So rather than throw an emotional bomb at her the night before, I kept my silence. I told her a week later, though I knew she had decided to be with him. I told her, not to confuse or ask anything of her, simply because she deserved to know. Her old insecurities had been wrong, and I still wanted to be a part of her life. She was not happy. Mad that I had taken so long to feel what she had felt months earlier, mad that I hadn't said anything that last night, mad that she thought I was only pretending to be friends, and even still insecure that I could still want someone like her in my life. That was only a month ago, and to this day we talk everyday, call at least once a week, and see each other nearly every week. We are both excited for an upcoming con, a game release later this year, and she expressed wanting to go to renn faire with me still. She is fast becoming my best friend, and I honestly am so happy I met her, I don't regret a thing. I don't know what the future holds, I'm casually looking for another partner, but mainly on bettering myself. We may or may not ever get back together, but I hope that in five years we are still talking every day, and getting together once a week to see each other. Love is beautiful in all forms, even at times in heartbreak and lost potential."},

I tried dating apps and asking people out for the better part of a decade not really feeling much of a connection or finding a spark that fizzled out quickly. In the last couple years I realized I was asexual. The general population is less than 1% ace, and of that one percent you‚Äôre lucky if you find 1 or 2 people you have something in common with. When I saw her dating profile I was floored. Someone who was more like me than anyone I‚Äôd ever seen on any dating app, ace, and incredibly beautiful. We hit it off pretty quickly through text chat and quickly moved to phone calls. We have similar niche hobbies, asthetics, work in the same industry, similar off brand humor, politics, values, and so many more things. She‚Äôs hilarious, nerdy, an incredible artist talented beyond her years, jaw dropping beautiful, smart, affectionate and caring. I have so many overwhelming feelings about her and our time together so far, like on our first date when she held my arm as we drunkenly walked the city streets looking at an festival market and playing ski ball together at the arcade, or our second date having a picnic in the botanical gardens, looking at all the Christmas lights in town til dark and doing star gazing. It‚Äôs been almost a year of dating and every one we go one seems impossibly magical  putting rom coms to shame.

I definitely thought the falling in the first or second meeting was exaggerated or unhealthy behavior before it happened to me. He also fell very early on and hasn't felt a connection like ours before. So even though we felt it early, it felt better to say it later lol"},
{"Title": "To rekindle, or not to rekindle that is the question *lengthy*", "Author": "u/Traditional-Wait-827", "Content": "So there is a boy M (26?) and me F (28) that met about 8 years ago. We had mutuals so we would come around each other when our friends had kickbacks etc. I began to pursue him because I thought he was cute and liked him. Eventually he showed me that he reciprocated so we began to date and go out. We would go to sports games out to dinners & he would come over often to swim etc.  we had a real strong connection and all- This all happened so fast, but we were young and in love. even though I wanted him to make me his girlfriend he never did because he didn't know that I wanted that. Eventually I got back with my ex & we decided to stay as \"friends\". Obviously the relationship with my ex didn't work out and we ended up breaking up indefinitely. I continued to live my life, but I couldn't help but not being able to stop thinking about the one that got away. It has been years since we've talked and yet I feel like this- wondering what if?  One night while drinking with my friends I got the balls to reach out to him (the one who got away). I tried to rekindle our relationship and at first he was for it. He was a bit hesitant and still had a wall up which was understandable, but gradually he was letting me in. We decided we were going to take it slow and we were not girlfriend and boyfriend yet, but I was happy and content with how it was going. I was growing as a person in different aspects of my life and wanted him to be apart of it all. Sometime later that month I went hiking with my best friend that I call Main Squeeze, babe, bae all of the above (she‚Äôs been my bestie since middle school). We were making it a habit of going hiking every weekend. One Saturday when we went hiking, I posted on Twitter \"going hiking with bae\" & he saw it and immediately unfollowed me and ghosted me. l know from his perspective it seemed wrong, but I was seriously hiking with my best friend. Looking back now obvi that was stupid to do but I was young and dumb. Me being young, dumb and immature, I didn't think to reach out to him and I just let it be. I was being stubborn that he unfollowed me and left it as is. I never got to explain myself or tell him that it was only my best friend I was hiking with. Here I am 8 years later still thinking of him and now he was the one that got away. I keep thinking of where life could've taken us & how happy we could've been. It makes me sad because I want him to see the person that I am today, (grown with an education, car own place etc), I still have things I can work on & those are all materialistic things but I have worked so hard for the person I am today. I‚Äôm so proud of the woman I am today and wish he could be apart of this chapter of my life. Maybe a year or two after that incident I reached out to him through text. At that time he was in a relationship so he just responded with \" maybe you shouldn't be texting me lol\" I said OK and left it as is. Fast forward to today they are no longer together, that relationship did not last long and as far as I know he is single. I brought this up to my therapist and she encouraged me to maybe reach out now to just express my feelings and where I'm at right now, to do it now while we're single and not committed to anything. She said that might be easier because time will pass and if I wait for more time for us to be in committed relationships or even married with a family to then even think about reaching out will be difficult. So should I do it? Should I reach out? I don't want to be a bother. I don't want to be a fool or make a fool of myself. Should I just let it be and continue to live my life how l've been? It has been years since we've talked and yet I feel like this wondering what if?"},

I'm 27F and never been in love before, so I've no baseline for how it's supposed to feel. I tried researching it and one of the most common answers was \"you just know\" followed by \"if you have to ask, you're not\" but I'm not sure that'll be true for me as I'm a bit disconnected from my emotions. For instance, with my friends, they're great people, I love being around them and I want the best for them, but do I love them? I don't know. I can confidently say I love my best friend, but that's because I've known her 13 years. And I never had a \"wow, I love this girl\" revelation with her either. I only knew years down the line when I realised we'd built something permanent and substantial and we knew each other inside and out. It's the same with my family - I know I love them because they've been in my life for so long. I can't picture life without them. So I'd say love to me = familiarity and comfort. Is romantic love different? Less about the practicalities? I just don't understand. I like this guy a lot. I'm attracted to him physically but also emotionally. I'm a very shy person, I struggle with social anxiety, but when I'm with him I never worry about being judged or saying the wrong thing. I just feel completely at ease, like I can totally be myself. I've never been around him and thought \"man, I wish this would end.\" We always have fun together. I care about him and want to impress him, he's the first thing on my mind in the mornings and the last thing on my mind at night. Is this what love is supposed to be? I've never looked at him and had a magical revelation. I don't know if it'll last. But I know I want to keep showing up for him, and I hope he wants that too."},

I was over that person and I was ready the date. But the funny thing was, I decided to hop on PlayStation with my two friends wanting to play a video game to just pass the time since at the time I was living with my parents and I was waiting to go to work because at the time I didn‚Äôt have my license. so we played a game of Fortnite and rocket league and I think we did fall guys. But then I was talking to one of my friends and I said dude this whole. PlayStation list of people on here is very bare meaning I don‚Äôt have any person. I only had like my family and a few coworkers on there. And my friends from school when I graduated. I said to my friend I wish there was a way that I can find people and be friends with and just play video games because at the time I was still in a dark place I needed somebody to talk to like my friends didn‚Äôt really talk to me about that stuff because sometimes they would get annoyed And would not talk to them about it. So I hopped on Reddit. I had an old account where I went on the sub, but I had to delete it because of stuff happened, which explain another time but I went on there scrolled a few to see if anybody was willing to play a video game. I met one person. they were from the states like I was we didn‚Äôt really play any games. We just talked on discord that was really about it. We were talking for about a few weeks and they were likely busy a lot so we didn‚Äôt really get much talking to and I didn‚Äôt really get to play with them on video games so I was a little bummed out about that so I scrolled again on that sub Reddit to look then I found the post that would change my life like seriously she made a post about wanting to find people to play video games. There was a few people on that. That asked her to play video games. They gave their usernames to her and I was one of the few that gave her mine because I said hey I‚Äôm a girl if that matters. After a bit, I hopped on PlayStation and played with my friends, and I got a notification. Saying the infamous line hey are you from Reddit? And I said yes I‚Äôm from Reddit. Are you that person that made that post and obviously I was thinking oh my God I‚Äôm so stupid. Yes of course that is. We started talking for a bit. She asked me are you from the UK and I said I‚Äôm actually from the United States we started talking a little bit and we didn‚Äôt play any games at first she actually ghosted me for a bit lol and after that she came back and we started playing a video games together, and she asked me if I had discord and I gave her my username to her so after that, we actually started talking a lot more and we actually had so much in common we played video games and after a while we actually started having feelings for each other when we were talking about this not long ago she said she was the first person to fall in love with me even though I was like wait really I was shocked because I was the first person that fell in love with her so now the rest is history it‚Äôs been going on for almost 2 years now me and her together in December.

{"Title": "I think I handled this situation with my girlfriend well, but I‚Äôd like to be sure", "Author": "u/MichiganWinterBear", "Content": "So I have a question/story just trying to gauge if I handled this situation appropriately and carefully and thoughtfully. My girlfriend and I have been going through my out for 2 1/2-3 months or so, and yesterday she told me she thinks she loves me. I knew ahead of time I wasn‚Äôt going to say it until we were further into the relationship as I‚Äôve gotten out of a 13 year marriage and want to be careful because she‚Äôs my first relationship post divorce. I do feel those feelings, I want to spend every day with her and when she leaves I‚Äôm very sad. The thing that‚Äôs made this relationship feel different is I am a different man than the one who was married for 13 years. It was a high school sweetheart relationship and we both had our failings but for my part I wasn‚Äôt emotionally mature enough to be the husband and loving partner I needed to be. I‚Äôve made those changes with my new girlfriend and it‚Äôs been appreciated and shown. She makes me know I have changed into who I‚Äôve wanted to be and appreciates when I‚Äôm trying in a way my ex just didn‚Äôt. We‚Äôve also gone through some emotionally heavy times with my divorce obviously looming over our relationship and the grieving process for me that entails as well as her having lost her father this past week after a years long fight with cancer. I have been there for her in the way I always knew I could but never did with my ex wife. I‚Äôve been supportive, I met her father on his deathbed, drove up the day after to support her. And we were lying in bed and she let out all of her emotions over his passing (she‚Äôd been handling it weirdly well in the days after until that moment). I held her while she cried as much as she needed and then she said she wanted to say something but was nervous. I had a feeling I knew what she was going to say but I tried to give her the space to because it felt like she really wanted to. And then she said it. ‚ÄúI think I love you‚Äù It made me flutter, it felt like every effort I‚Äôve made on myself to be a better man to be a better partner were recognized by someone I enjoy so much and can see a future with. I responded with what I felt was the most heartfelt way while explaining where I was at. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm getting closer every day.‚Äù It‚Äôs an accurate description that I am getting to that point to say it back, that I‚Äôm building an emotional connection, I just can‚Äôt say it this close to when my marriage dissolved. But also I want her to know it‚Äôs not that I won‚Äôt be or that I‚Äôm emotionally unavailable. And to her absolute credit she said she didn‚Äôt need to hear it back, just that she needed to say it because she‚Äôs felt it since the day after I met her father. So I just want to be certain I handled this right, that I responded in the right way to say exactly how I feel: I will be there someday soon just not yet."},

I feel like that this is more of a wedding vow or an engagement line, that requires at least a committed year together with all the highs and lows. The thing is, and this is something that I've observed, is that when a man is genuinely committed to their partner, he will move mountains, he will part seas for them, he will bring the sky down, if that's what it takes. People sing for love, live for love, kill for love, and die for love. And that's so true. You will literally start wars and make peace for love. I don't know, I probably should start actually dating someone. It's just hard being vulnerable, and it's really not something that I need to worry about right now, because of my other priorities. It would be nice, to be with someone. But I don't want to be with someone just to be with someone, I want it to be because I'm truly, madly, deeply, completely in love with them. That is the way. And my more Mandalorian side is showing now. Because they have to be your cyare . It's actually a little funny because, at least for me, love is deep, ocean deep to the hadosphere. It can be as beautiful as a sunfish, or as monstrous as an anglerfish. It depends on the day, and it depends on the people involved, and of course, the reciprocity. There's one thing I've learned though, you should never sacrifice your self-respect. That if somebody genuinely loves you, they will value your self-respect and your agency too much to allow you to burn it. Went from a question to an early morning philosophy rant.

We have been together 'officially' for a very quick seven months but have always had a flirtatiuos relationship with each other from the start. I remember the first time I saw him I thought he was so attractive, everyone else who knew him was so excited to see him so he seemed very friendly and personable. Fast-forward to where we are at now and I could have never imagined my life turning out like it is now. I stay with him about 90% of the time and every time I look at him I want to physically cry from how happy I am. I can't remember the last time I have felt this genuinely happy. I recently went through a bad concussion that affected my blood pressure (weird, I know) and I could barely even walk ten feet without nearly passing out which meant I couldn't work out like I'm use to and that was super hard for me. I spent so much time crying from stress/pain and all that and he never left my side if he didn't have to. He was overly caring and I had never felt so loved in my life. His parents were even calling to check in on me and I had never felt like a partner's parents had cared so much. Everytime I look at my bf I am amazed at how lucky I got to be with him. I love watching him play his video games and seeing him so happy. His laugh is the best sound to me and he always hold me so tightly. I love going with him to run little errands because I love being able to be seen with him in public. He will always give me butterflies and I have never felt my heart so full for someone. I just wanted to tell someone/anyone/everyone about how happy I am because I am so in love and can't wait to marry this man and grow our own little family!"},

I was in a temporary situation with someone and before it started we both agreed it had a countdown because we both would be moving to very different places quite soon and there's little to no chance of crossing paths after. All was understood and glad this was clear and upfront, but after it ended I came to a strange realization. Compared to all flings or real relationships (some more healthy/successful than others) I've had in the past it was the most authentic affection I've received so far. And the most I've wanted to give affection in return. I'm not particularly sad or regretful in any way cause I knew the conditions, but I'm startled that I can confidently say a less than two month fling felt more honest and caring than any previous entanglement had. I don't think it's because it is more fresh in my mind, just to state. I guess I just always felt like I did more or more was always expected from me than was ever given. I guess I'm wondering how it's possible that the most mature and earnest experience of positive emotional expression (non-platonic) I've had so far came from something so simple and short lived ?"},

I asked her if she really meant it and she said, yes I do, which made her turn even more red. I felt totally no doubt at all and I told her I loved her too.

The tears on your face as we said I love you for the last time are forever imprinted in my memory. You don't know how badly I wanted to wipe them away, kiss your forehead, and promise you it would be okay. I knew I couldn't, because then I would never get out of your car. I've been trying to keep myself busy. Started going to the gym every day instead of every other. It hasn't really helped too much, but it's nice to keep my mind off you for a few hours. I stare at my bare ring finger more often than I should. I still instinctively go to grab my ring off my dresser when I wake up every morning, even though it's not there anymore. Everything makes me think of you. The cicadas chirping makes me think of us laughing when you told me they keep getting caught in your windshield. The news reminds me of our long drives where we would discuss politics and everything going on in the world. Every outfit I put on reminds me of when I would wear it with you. Inside Out 2 comes out in two days! I hope you're as excited as I am. I know we've been planning for months on watching it together on opening night. A part of me wonders if we'll be watching it at the same time at different theatres, laughing and crying at the same parts of it. Honestly, I'm probably just going to cry through this whole thing as I wish you were by my side while I watch. Maybe I'll wait to see it until I feel ready. I hope you still get to see it, though. I can't stop living in the \"what ifs\" of it all. What could have been different, what could have changed. I yearn for you. My heart feels half empty. I know it's unhealthy to live in the past, but the only way I've been able to fall asleep at night is when I replay our old memories in our head. Even then, I wake up in the middle of the night gasping and imagining the past few days have just been some fucked up nightmare. I had to mute your number, because every time my phone buzzed, deep down I hoped it was you. Even still, I find myself constantly looking at the little red numbers above the texting app, hoping it goes up by one. The amount of times I dialed your number just to not hit call is pathetic. I just need to hear your voice. I know this yearning is unhealthy, but I don't know when it will go away. I miss your smile, and the way your nose scrunches when you're really happy. I miss your silky black hair and your mocha skin. I miss your dark brown eyes that I would constantly get lost in. I miss your touch and I miss your kisses. I miss feeling the tightness when you squeeze me when we hug. I miss hearing your heart beat when I rest my head on your chest. I remember the first time I ever did that way back when we first staring dating and I could feel it racing, it made me blush. I miss your gentle voice and your roaring laugh. I miss our deep talks and our petty gossip. I even miss our fights, as dumb as that sounds. I just miss everything. It's been hard to scroll through social media because anytime I see something that reminds me of you, I want to send it to you. I've been sending them to my own number instead. In fact, to be honest, I've been texting my own number a lot. Whenever I want to text you, I just text it to myself. It still cuts like glass when the message immediately bounces back. Anyway, my eyes are getting misty so I'll stop here. Goodbye, my love. Maybe in another life, we'll do things right. I love you infinity plus one, ha I win."},

My girlfriend and I have been together for a little over 6 months and have known each other for a year. Due to it being her sister's birthday and a holiday the following week, I decided to plan a celebration this weekend. I made her a little trailer to advertise our anniversary. I used the Black Widow trailer and near the end, it cuts to me with a photo collage of us together and advertising our two-night event. The first night was okay, the internet made the video quality of our video call grainy and it kept cutting in and out. Even with that, I sent her the mixtape I made her (with songs that we both shared) and she loved it! Okay, moving on to the big event. Yesterday was our big event and after discussing our relationship and how far we've come, she told me she had a surprise for me at 11:59pm. Woah. I told her I did too (maybe a mistake on my part because she was expecting something, DARN IT!!!) and we danced, watched a movie and played games to pass the time. So, at 12:01am, after freshening up in the bathroom we got to the bathroom. I got back to the phone and after a little pause, she says \"I kinda, sorta, am 100% in love with you.\" She sent me her beautiful gift and I was happy! Then, I asked if it was my turn to share with her and she said yes. I prepared a four page speech (which was going to actually be a letter, but I just decided to read it to her). In the letter, it was very personal and heartfelt. I told her I love her. She, teary-eyed, paused and said...\"I love you too.\" I cried, we all cried. It was sooooo beautiful. She then said \"I knew since February.\" *sobs* We spent the rest of the night talking about the ways we were planning on saying it. Then we went to sleep at the same time, we didn't hang up and we woke up and continued the conversation. I will never forget this special moment. Thank you so much, V. I love you so much!

They're they're own person too. I feel like that would be too much pressure on someone. I don't understand \"romantic expectations\" like sex or how your life goal according to society should be to get in a romantic relationship. I don't understand so much about \"love\" or affection, at least now how society views it, and I want to understand. I have a partner and I care about them very much. I feel about them differently than I do other people. I'd be okay sharing a life with them and doing things together. But, I don't feel that strong desire for certain romantic things. I love sending them gifts, calling them, and doing things together. I love being there for them and comforting them. I'm always proud of them. But it feels like my love differs from romantic or what's seen around me. I'd like to understand. I understand strong care. I understand wanting to give your life to protect someone. I understand wanting to keep someone safe. I understand letting someone go if they'd be happier.

I've gone back and forth on if I should tell this story, but I'm a writer at heart and putting thoughts and emotions to words is how I work through it all, and maybe someone will read this and feel something, also so all the kids out there know that love is never simple, and you are bound to get caught up in it even well into your adult years. So back in January I met lets call her N, and we instantly connected. Like she called me the night after our coffee date to talk more, it was just so comfortable, we texted every day, called few times a week. Within a couple weeks we'd been on three more dates and made things official, after that we spent every weekend either at her place or mine, and occasionally got together during the week too. N and I have a dozen things in common, specific video games, humor, movies, and even our obscure fashion and interior design choices match. We shared personal, private pains. Before two months were up she had told me she loved me, I'd told her I was getting there, I had met her friends more than once, and we both had told our parents about each other. It seemed like a beautiful beginning. But then it ended suddenly. She had a bout of insecurities and she felt like she didn't deserve me, I couldn't convince her I was happy with her, and she ended things. But neither of us wanted the other out of our lives. We continued to talk every day, call each other, and we still regularly got together in person. After more than a month it looked from my side like we could start again, but N had an old long distance friend. This guy had never been too happy we were dating, and had decided now was a good time to come down and see N for the first time in years. I had an opportunity to tell N how I truly felt before he showed up, N and I had gone out drinking the night before he arrived, and though she showed doubt about what she wanted from her old friend, there was wonder too. So rather than throw an emotional bomb at her the night before, I kept my silence. I told her a week later, though I knew she had decided to be with him. I told her, not to confuse or ask anything of her, simply because she deserved to know. Her old insecurities had been wrong, and I still wanted to be a part of her life. She was not happy. Mad that I had taken so long to feel what she had felt months earlier, mad that I hadn't said anything that last night, mad that she thought I was only pretending to be friends, and even still insecure that I could still want someone like her in my life. That was only a month ago, and to this day we talk everyday, call at least once a week, and see each other nearly every week. We are both excited for an upcoming con, a game release later this year, and she expressed wanting to go to renn faire with me still. She is fast becoming my best friend, and I honestly am so happy I met her, I don't regret a thing. I don't know what the future holds, I'm casually looking for another partner, but mainly on bettering myself. We may or may not ever get back together, but I hope that in five years we are still talking every day, and getting together once a week to see each other.

Connection, and shared experiences. Self love. The love of being a parent, or being a child. Closeness with your family, or building your own chosen family. Friendships, marriages, and pets. This is what it's about. And I'm eternally grateful to be filled with an infinite amount of love, and especially grateful to feel it back. ‚ù§Ô∏è"},

{"Title": "I‚Äôm thinking of ending my marriage of nearly two decades", "Author": "Unknown author", "Content": "I met the love of my life, knew I was going to marry her from the moment I saw her. Fought for her and married her less than a year later. My life was complete. I was the happiest guy on earth. This lasted for 10 years where I knew we had the kind of bond you see in movies. Nothing could ever tear us apart. It was us against the world. Then we decided to start a family. Immediately after she gave birth her whole demeanour towards me changed overnight. Gone were the constant moments of affection, the closeness we had on a daily basis, the sex, everything. I put it down to hormonal changes as giving birth is a big ordeal after all, and I gave her time. Lots of time. When after 3 years nothing changed, I sat her down and told her how I felt and how she made me feel. Like I was a stranger in my own house. Like I was living with a room mate who were only acquaintances with no romantic ties, hell without a proper friendship. I was expecting her to say she didn‚Äôt feel the same about me anymore, but to my surprise she said she hadn‚Äôt noticed!! She said she would try harder, and that was that. Nothing changed and we continued our surreal coexistence where nothing made sense to me. I suggested we see a marriage councillor to try and help. At first she agreed, but when d-day arrived she refused to take part. Fast forward another 3 years and I‚Äôm at my wits end. Unconditional love has turned into resentment. Joyful moments throughout the day where we exchanged a kiss or a touch or even a look has turned into a depressing nightmare for me where I feel utterly rejected and useless as a husband. I feel like the only reason I‚Äôm still needed is when I have to do things for her. Like fix her car, or build her some furniture or run errands. I don‚Äôt get anything in return that makes it feel worthwhile to be married to her anymore. I don‚Äôt ask for much. All I want is my wife back, to feel wanted and loved. But I‚Äôm getting nothing. At this point the resentment has grown so much that I don‚Äôt think I could trust it even if she magically decided to treat me like she used to. So here I am contemplating ending our marriage. Not because there‚Äôs someone else. I don‚Äôt know if I could ever trust anyone else. All I know is I will be happier on my own because I won‚Äôt be reminded every day of what my life used to be like. The only thing stopping me is our daughter. She is the light of my life and I would rather be unhappy so she doesn‚Äôt have to be. She loves us both equally and she knows something is up because she is forever trying to bring us closer together, even though she‚Äôs only 6. People say it‚Äôs better for kids if break up with your partner than be in a toxic relationship around them. And I agree. The only thing is we are perfectly pleasant towards one another. We never fight or scream and shout. My wife seems perfectly happy with the current arrangement as she is always on a high. And I would be over the moon for her, but not at my expense and my happiness. I‚Äôm thinking I should give this a final chance and say to her I‚Äôm about to end it unless she agrees to some councilling, to see if this marriage can be saved. Other than that I don‚Äôt see what other options I have but to walk out of this marriage. Love was always enough for me. It was my only requirement, and without it I have no reason to stay. If anyone has any insight or went through something similar I would be grateful for a bit of guidance as it scares the shit out of me."},

I‚Äôve been seeing her for almost a year and I‚Äôm still anticipating someone popping out with a camera crew to let me know it‚Äôs all been a set up, but it never happens. I tried dating apps and asking people out for the better part of a decade not really feeling much of a connection or finding a spark that fizzled out quickly. In the last couple years I realized I was asexual. The general population is less than 1% ace, and of that one percent you‚Äôre lucky if you find 1 or 2 people you have something in common with. When I saw her dating profile I was floored. Someone who was more like me than anyone I‚Äôd ever seen on any dating app, ace, and incredibly beautiful. We hit it off pretty quickly through text chat and quickly moved to phone calls. We have similar niche hobbies, asthetics, work in the same industry, similar off brand humor, politics, values, and so many more things. She‚Äôs hilarious, nerdy, an incredible artist talented beyond her years, jaw dropping beautiful, smart, affectionate and caring. I have so many overwhelming feelings about her and our time together so far, like on our first date when she held my arm as we drunkenly walked the city streets looking at an festival market and playing ski ball together at the arcade, or our second date having a picnic in the botanical gardens, looking at all the Christmas lights in town til dark and doing star gazing. It‚Äôs been almost a year of dating and every one we go one seems impossibly magical  putting rom coms to shame. We spend a few evenings each week playing board games online, cracking jokes and telling each other about what‚Äôs going on in our lives. It‚Äôs been like finding a new best friend who I can also cuddle and shower with admiration. I‚Äôm mostly writing this because I can‚Äôt see her immediately and need to vent all this loving energy somewhere.

{"Title": "To rekindle, or not to rekindle that is the question *lengthy*", "Author": "u/Traditional-Wait-827", "Content": "So there is a boy M (26?) and me F (28) that met about 8 years ago. We had mutuals so we would come around each other when our friends had kickbacks etc. I began to pursue him because I thought he was cute and liked him. Eventually he showed me that he reciprocated so we began to date and go out. We would go to sports games out to dinners & he would come over often to swim etc.  we had a real strong connection and all- This all happened so fast, but we were young and in love. even though I wanted him to make me his girlfriend he never did because he didn't know that I wanted that. Eventually I got back with my ex & we decided to stay as \"friends\". Obviously the relationship with my ex didn't work out and we ended up breaking up indefinitely. I continued to live my life, but I couldn't help but not being able to stop thinking about the one that got away. It has been years since we've talked and yet I feel like this- wondering what if?  One night while drinking with my friends I got the balls to reach out to him (the one who got away). I tried to rekindle our relationship and at first he was for it. He was a bit hesitant and still had a wall up which was understandable, but gradually he was letting me in. We decided we were going to take it slow and we were not girlfriend and boyfriend yet, but I was happy and content with how it was going. I was growing as a person in different aspects of my life and wanted him to be apart of it all. Sometime later that month I went hiking with my best friend that I call Main Squeeze, babe, bae all of the above (she‚Äôs been my bestie since middle school). We were making it a habit of going hiking every weekend. One Saturday when we went hiking, I posted on Twitter \"going hiking with bae\" & he saw it and immediately unfollowed me and ghosted me. l know from his perspective it seemed wrong, but I was seriously hiking with my best friend. Looking back now obvi that was stupid to do but I was young and dumb. Me being young, dumb and immature, I didn't think to reach out to him and I just let it be. I was being stubborn that he unfollowed me and left it as is. I never got to explain myself or tell him that it was only my best friend I was hiking with. Here I am 8 years later still thinking of him and now he was the one that got away. I keep thinking of where life could've taken us & how happy we could've been. It makes me sad because I want him to see the person that I am today, (grown with an education, car own place etc), I still have things I can work on & those are all materialistic things but I have worked so hard for the person I am today. I‚Äôm so proud of the woman I am today and wish he could be apart of this chapter of my life. Maybe a year or two after that incident I reached out to him through text. At that time he was in a relationship so he just responded with \" maybe you shouldn't be texting me lol\" I said OK and left it as is. Fast forward to today they are no longer together, that relationship did not last long and as far as I know he is single. I brought this up to my therapist and she encouraged me to maybe reach out now to just express my feelings and where I'm at right now, to do it now while we're single and not committed to anything. She said that might be easier because time will pass and if I wait for more time for us to be in committed relationships or even married with a family to then even think about reaching out will be difficult. So should I do it? Should I reach out? I don't want to be a bother. I don't want to be a fool or make a fool of myself. Should I just let it be and continue to live my life how l've been?

I was over that person and I was ready the date. But the funny thing was, I decided to hop on PlayStation with my two friends wanting to play a video game to just pass the time since at the time I was living with my parents and I was waiting to go to work because at the time I didn‚Äôt have my license. so we played a game of Fortnite and rocket league and I think we did fall guys.

I only had like my family and a few coworkers on there. And my friends from school when I graduated. I said to my friend I wish there was a way that I can find people and be friends with and just play video games because at the time I was still in a dark place I needed somebody to talk to like my friends didn‚Äôt really talk to me about that stuff because sometimes they would get annoyed And would not talk to them about it. So I hopped on Reddit. I had an old account where I went on the sub, but I had to delete it because of stuff happened, which explain another time but I went on there scrolled a few to see if anybody was willing to play a video game. I met one person. they were from the states like I was we didn‚Äôt really play any games. We just talked on discord that was really about it. We were talking for about a few weeks and they were likely busy a lot so we didn‚Äôt really get much talking to and I didn‚Äôt really get to play with them on video games so I was a little bummed out about that so I scrolled again on that sub Reddit to look then I found the post that would change my life like seriously she made a post about wanting to find people to play video games. There was a few people on that. That asked her to play video games. They gave their usernames to her and I was one of the few that gave her mine because I said hey I‚Äôm a girl if that matters. After a bit, I hopped on PlayStation and played with my friends, and I got a notification. Saying the infamous line hey are you from Reddit? And I said yes I‚Äôm from Reddit. Are you that person that made that post and obviously I was thinking oh my God I‚Äôm so stupid. Yes of course that is. We started talking for a bit. She asked me are you from the UK and I said I‚Äôm actually from the United States we started talking a little bit and we didn‚Äôt play any games at first she actually ghosted me for a bit lol and after that she came back and we started playing a video games together, and she asked me if I had discord and I gave her my username to her so after that, we actually started talking a lot more and we actually had so much in common we played video games and after a while we actually started having feelings for each other when we were talking about this not long ago she said she was the first person to fall in love with me even though I was like wait really I was shocked because I was the first person that fell in love with her so now the rest is history it‚Äôs been going on for almost 2 years now me and her together in December.

But it was so romantic and cute and that‚Äôs when I realized it. Also his voice is insanely beautiful and he just sounded so good. He‚Äôs got me whipped"},

He always listen to me carefully and get better progressively. -one day his elbow hitted my face (it was not painful). He didnt know i was behind him. He immediately tell a little \"ooooh\" he stopped what he was doing, and take me in his arms and kissed me where the elbow hit for five straight minutes. -i love harry styles. He began to listen to harry styles just so that he could sing with me -he gets very childish everytime he pet a cat. He always has a large smile and he is extremely happy -similar to harry styles, i began reading one piece because i know its his favorite manga. When he learned that i was reading one piece, he was so happy. Sometimes when i read one piece he likes to take me in his arms and read with me. -one time we were going to the gym together. My bf is short and skinny, so i wasnt expecting him to be lifting so heavy lol. When i saw him doing a squat lifting twice my weight, i swear i would have teared his clothes if no one was there. -when he drives. I dont think i need to explain this one. -he has asthma. When he takes his ventoline, i find it extremely sexy (i know its weird) -sometimes he just take my hand and kiss it without reason. -more serious here. He previously had eating disorders and body dysmorphia, due to being bullied in high school. He makes lot of effort to overcome it. He accept now when we do cheat meals bc he know it makes me happy. He is seeing a therapist. I teach him how to be confident, and he puts the work in. This is something very important and sweet to him, and incredibly cute and sexy too -one night he protected me against a drunk guy that was a bit too touchy despite me not wanting. Its the first time i saw my bf being very mad. I wasnt even hurt but my bf took me in his arms saying \"you are safe now\" with the sweetest voice ever. Let me tell you the next day i took all of his stamina lol."},

In every previous relationship, I've cried because of how I was treated. They cheated, they called me names for being upset that they were cheating, basically anything but physical abuse for toxic and unhealthy relationships. I thought I knew what love was, but it turns out I only found out what love isn't. My current boyfriend buys me flowers regularly, he buys me stuffed animals, he takes me on dates, we communicate about our issues, he listens to me, we've had many nights where we just turn on the record player and dance in our living room. He makes me feel loved and seen in a way that I never have before. I don't want this magic to end. I've never loved someone the way I love him. I appreciate him so much. Don't give up hope.

{"Title": "I accidently discovered my boyfriend's secret reddit account, and it only made me love him harder.", "Author": "Unknown author", "Content": "My boyfriend (21M) and me (21F) really value privacy in our relationship. We both have reddit accounts where we go to fool around, post memes, ask questions, and vent, but we've agreed not to share it with each other because we both have private thoughts on it. As a sort of pre-cursor to the story, it is important to note that my boyfriend struggles with being emotional, and prefers to be optimistic and overly positive and reassure me that he's fine, that nothing is wrong, that he can handle it, that he's not bothered. I've never believed him but I've never challenged it either. Today, my boyfriend mentioned he posted on reddit for the first time. He said that it was a \"career-related post\", and that he was proud because his post had \"almost 700 upvotes and over 100 comments\". I asked him what it was about, and he said \"my experience with my internship\". I jokingly prodded further and he laughed and refused to elaborate, saying I would find his account easily if he did. I dropped the topic and forgot about it. On a side note, we are both in very similar careers. About an hour ago, I went to a certain subreddit that I frequent to look for posts relevant to my field of research, when I came across a post of someone talking about their experience in this field. Interested, I clicked on the post. As I read it, I felt a nagging sense of familiarity, like someone I knew had written it, but I dropped that thought because I felt it was unlikely. The post went in great detail discussing this person's struggles with their grades, how they never felt like enough, how they thought they would never get hired, and yet how they broke through and got the job. They discussed their growing passion for teaching (which is the reason they made the post, they elaborated) and how they feel fulfilled when they give back. The post was a journey riddled with struggle and doubt and stress, but also brimming with success and passion and charity. I was very touched by it. When I reached the bottom of the post, I glanced at the post stats: Almost 700 upvotes. Over 100 comments. I realized then that I was reading about my boyfriend's struggle, a struggle that he'd kept hidden from me! He'd convinced me at the time of his applying to jobs that he wasn't stressed at all and that he was confident he'd get the job, no matter how much I tried to tell him it was okay if he felt stressed. He would tell me his grades were great and he didn't care about them anyways, and he would tell me his interviews went fine and that he wasn't going to waste time worrying about them. His post, though, told a different story. He had very low grades and never thought he would get hired. All of his friends got hired before him. He was shaking so hard in one interview that he felt the interviewers could see him shake. And yet, he got a job, and a well-paying one at that. He talked about his fears and his passions. He shared his story so others could benefit. He learned through this that he loves to be a teacher. Honestly, I want to cry. He is so beautiful. I didn't know he struggled like this, and my heart is just overflowing with so much pride and joy and happiness for his successes. He's honest and a hardworker, and his willingless to give back to the community in the hopes that he can help another struggling student land a job is just...amazing. Of course, I will never tell him I read it, and I chose not to click on his profile, but it's changed my perspective on him and though I didn't think it was possible, I love him even more now. I love him so much!"},

I'm 27F and never been in love before, so I've no baseline for how it's supposed to feel. I tried researching it and one of the most common answers was \"you just know\" followed by \"if you have to ask, you're not\" but I'm not sure that'll be true for me as I'm a bit disconnected from my emotions. For instance, with my friends, they're great people, I love being around them and I want the best for them, but do I love them? I don't know. I can confidently say I love my best friend, but that's because I've known her 13 years. And I never had a \"wow, I love this girl\" revelation with her either. I only knew years down the line when I realised we'd built something permanent and substantial and we knew each other inside and out. It's the same with my family - I know I love them because they've been in my life for so long. I can't picture life without them. So I'd say love to me = familiarity and comfort. Is romantic love different? Less about the practicalities? I just don't understand. I like this guy a lot. I'm attracted to him physically but also emotionally. I'm a very shy person, I struggle with social anxiety, but when I'm with him I never worry about being judged or saying the wrong thing. I just feel completely at ease, like I can totally be myself. I've never been around him and thought \"man, I wish this would end.\" We always have fun together. I care about him and want to impress him, he's the first thing on my mind in the mornings and the last thing on my mind at night. Is this what love is supposed to be? I've never looked at him and had a magical revelation. I don't know if it'll last. But I know I want to keep showing up for him, and I hope he wants that too."},

I was over that person and I was ready the date. But the funny thing was, I decided to hop on PlayStation with my two friends wanting to play a video game to just pass the time since at the time I was living with my parents and I was waiting to go to work because at the time I didn‚Äôt have my license. so we played a game of Fortnite and rocket league and I think we did fall guys. But then I was talking to one of my friends and I said dude this whole. PlayStation list of people on here is very bare meaning I don‚Äôt have any person. I only had like my family and a few coworkers on there. And my friends from school when I graduated. I said to my friend I wish there was a way that I can find people and be friends with and just play video games because at the time I was still in a dark place I needed somebody to talk to like my friends didn‚Äôt really talk to me about that stuff because sometimes they would get annoyed And would not talk to them about it. So I hopped on Reddit. I had an old account where I went on the sub, but I had to delete it because of stuff happened, which explain another time but I went on there scrolled a few to see if anybody was willing to play a video game. I met one person. they were from the states like I was we didn‚Äôt really play any games. We just talked on discord that was really about it. We were talking for about a few weeks and they were likely busy a lot so we didn‚Äôt really get much talking to and I didn‚Äôt really get to play with them on video games so I was a little bummed out about that so I scrolled again on that sub Reddit to look then I found the post that would change my life like seriously she made a post about wanting to find people to play video games. There was a few people on that. That asked her to play video games. They gave their usernames to her and I was one of the few that gave her mine because I said hey I‚Äôm a girl if that matters. After a bit, I hopped on PlayStation and played with my friends, and I got a notification. Saying the infamous line hey are you from Reddit? And I said yes I‚Äôm from Reddit. Are you that person that made that post and obviously I was thinking oh my God I‚Äôm so stupid. Yes of course that is. We started talking for a bit. She asked me are you from the UK and I said I‚Äôm actually from the United States we started talking a little bit and we didn‚Äôt play any games at first she actually ghosted me for a bit lol and after that she came back and we started playing a video games together, and she asked me if I had discord and I gave her my username to her so after that, we actually started talking a lot more and we actually had so much in common we played video games and after a while we actually started having feelings for each other when we were talking about this not long ago she said she was the first person to fall in love with me even though I was like wait really I was shocked because I was the first person that fell in love with her so now the rest is history it‚Äôs been going on for almost 2 years now me and her together in December.

{"Title": "I think I handled this situation with my girlfriend well, but I‚Äôd like to be sure", "Author": "u/MichiganWinterBear", "Content": "So I have a question/story just trying to gauge if I handled this situation appropriately and carefully and thoughtfully. My girlfriend and I have been going through my out for 2 1/2-3 months or so, and yesterday she told me she thinks she loves me. I knew ahead of time I wasn‚Äôt going to say it until we were further into the relationship as I‚Äôve gotten out of a 13 year marriage and want to be careful because she‚Äôs my first relationship post divorce. I do feel those feelings, I want to spend every day with her and when she leaves I‚Äôm very sad. The thing that‚Äôs made this relationship feel different is I am a different man than the one who was married for 13 years. It was a high school sweetheart relationship and we both had our failings but for my part I wasn‚Äôt emotionally mature enough to be the husband and loving partner I needed to be. I‚Äôve made those changes with my new girlfriend and it‚Äôs been appreciated and shown. She makes me know I have changed into who I‚Äôve wanted to be and appreciates when I‚Äôm trying in a way my ex just didn‚Äôt. We‚Äôve also gone through some emotionally heavy times with my divorce obviously looming over our relationship and the grieving process for me that entails as well as her having lost her father this past week after a years long fight with cancer. I have been there for her in the way I always knew I could but never did with my ex wife. I‚Äôve been supportive, I met her father on his deathbed, drove up the day after to support her. And we were lying in bed and she let out all of her emotions over his passing (she‚Äôd been handling it weirdly well in the days after until that moment). I held her while she cried as much as she needed and then she said she wanted to say something but was nervous. I had a feeling I knew what she was going to say but I tried to give her the space to because it felt like she really wanted to. And then she said it. ‚ÄúI think I love you‚Äù It made me flutter, it felt like every effort I‚Äôve made on myself to be a better man to be a better partner were recognized by someone I enjoy so much and can see a future with. I responded with what I felt was the most heartfelt way while explaining where I was at. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm getting closer every day.‚Äù It‚Äôs an accurate description that I am getting to that point to say it back, that I‚Äôm building an emotional connection, I just can‚Äôt say it this close to when my marriage dissolved. But also I want her to know it‚Äôs not that I won‚Äôt be or that I‚Äôm emotionally unavailable. And to her absolute credit she said she didn‚Äôt need to hear it back, just that she needed to say it because she‚Äôs felt it since the day after I met her father. So I just want to be certain I handled this right, that I responded in the right way to say exactly how I feel: I will be there someday soon just not yet."},

I feel like that this is more of a wedding vow or an engagement line, that requires at least a committed year together with all the highs and lows. The thing is, and this is something that I've observed, is that when a man is genuinely committed to their partner, he will move mountains, he will part seas for them, he will bring the sky down, if that's what it takes. People sing for love, live for love, kill for love, and die for love. And that's so true. You will literally start wars and make peace for love. I don't know, I probably should start actually dating someone. It's just hard being vulnerable, and it's really not something that I need to worry about right now, because of my other priorities. It would be nice, to be with someone. But I don't want to be with someone just to be with someone, I want it to be because I'm truly, madly, deeply, completely in love with them. That is the way. And my more Mandalorian side is showing now. Because they have to be your cyare . It's actually a little funny because, at least for me, love is deep, ocean deep to the hadosphere. It can be as beautiful as a sunfish, or as monstrous as an anglerfish. It depends on the day, and it depends on the people involved, and of course, the reciprocity. There's one thing I've learned though, you should never sacrifice your self-respect. That if somebody genuinely loves you, they will value your self-respect and your agency too much to allow you to burn it. Went from a question to an early morning philosophy rant. Sorry about that and have a great weekend."},

Yes, but I think the way we are handling it will set us up better for anything in the future) To try to keep it short: my ex (28M) and I (26F) met in college and I knew immediately he was who I wanted to be with, he was cute, funny, kind, absolutely lit up every room he was in and he just genuinely made me so happy - fast forward to now (6.5 years later), we had been dating that whole time and went straight from college, to our first apartment, to buying a house and adopting 2 dogs but never spent any part of adult life alone. We both came into the relationship with a bit of a hole left from past relationships that we both filled for eachother but it left us with a major codependency issue that neither of us really noticed until now. Also since we bought our house 4 years ago, it basically was falling apart and needed expensive repairs often, we both had issues with work and very opposite schedules, and basically everything in our lives wasn‚Äôt working except our relationship but even that was strained by all of these outside factors. He recently came to me and said he thinks he needs some time on his own to work on himself because he has been feeling depressed and that he doesn‚Äôt like himself or really know who he is as an individual and that he felt like I was the only thing making him happy and helping him through everything and it worked for a long time but he needed to be able to work on all of this stuff for himself alone. This was a blindside for me because he didn‚Äôt communicate any of this to me earlier (an issue he said he regrets and needs to work on in therapy) but I just want him to be happy and healthy and I want him to have the time to heal those things, and I also have realized my codependency I‚Äôve developed through all of the shit we went through too. TLDR: it‚Äôs hard to sum up almost 7 years in a ‚Äúshort‚Äù post so a lot of context is missing but I tried my best - do you have a story of where you broke up and got back together or had a right person wrong time situation and it worked out?

{"Title": "My best friends mean the absolute whole world to me", "Author": "u/gemmadaniel", "Content": "My (19f) closest friends (19f, 19f, 19nb) have been with me for a long time. I‚Äôve known one since kindergarten and the other two since 6th grade. We‚Äôve all remained pretty close and have taken some hard hits together. In middle school, each year we had different ‚Äòfriends‚Äô that caused problems, mainly the impacts of their mental health affecting us. Then the other person who was in our group moved halfway across the country and then after a year or so, they stopped talking to us. In high school, we had a normal first semester of freshman year, then the pandemic hit. We went back sophomore year with all the masks, bleaching desks after each class, plexiglass dividers at lunch tables, you know the works. But on November 11th, I became paralyzed by a benign spinal tumor. The back pain I had leading up to it was excruciating, evidently it was a little tumor the size of the tip of my pinky finger destroying my spine from within. It completely destroyed my T2 vertebra, resulting in a full corpectomy, damaging T1-T4. I am a T4 incomplete paraplegic. This means I have no voluntary movement but some sensation. I can feel pressure and pain, but not temperature. I spent 2 months in the hospital (complications) and 2 months in rehab, all during the pandemic. This included turning 16 in quarantine as a staff member tested positive for covid. As a birthday gift, my friends got me a build a bear raccoon named Raccoon Reacts, an inside joke. Before the paralysis, I had a group of friends i‚Äôve been referring to as ‚Äòthe guys‚Äô since I was the only girl (no romantic feelings, they were like brothers to me.) I met them freshman year through shared classes and we‚Äôd discord call almost daily. Those calls helped me get through the hospital and rehab. My first outing after paralysis was a movie with them. I‚Äôd invite them over to hang out. I went back to school that fall, junior year. My counselor was able to make my lunch time the same as theirs so i‚Äôd have friends to sit with. After lunch, they‚Äôd come with me in the elevator, even if their class wasn‚Äôt upstairs. Throughout junior year, I started to notice that I stopped getting invited to things. I don‚Äôt know if they thought it would hurt more to be invited but not able to go due to inaccessibility of people‚Äôs houses, but I would‚Äôve preferred being invited anyway, that would mean they wanted me there, even if I couldn‚Äôt be. Speaking to a mutual, he said he noticed it too but didn‚Äôt say anything since we weren‚Äôt that close. Senior year, they stopped responding to messages. I would see them in the halls and would wave or smile at them and some would do the same. One of them kept his eyes forward. I‚Äôm not hard to miss and he was tall. I still have all of their birthdays on my calendar. I lost my ex best friend and ex boyfriend the same month, ending friendship after a fight and getting dumped. I felt so alone for so long. But my best friends helped pick up the pieces, offering support and love. We hadn‚Äôt been talking a ton when the problems w the guys happened, but one day I reached out, missing them, and it was like we never lost contact. It was back to sending memes to each other, talking about our day, etc. They‚Äôve been so supportive when things have gone wrong for me, and I‚Äôve been supportive the same. Now that we‚Äôre on summer break for some (I graduated with a one year diploma in pharmacy technician at a community college), it‚Äôs just working around work schedules to hang out. We‚Äôve gone to the zoo, saw movies, now we‚Äôre planning a puppy play date with our dogs. They‚Äôve been with me since day one and I don‚Äôt know what I would do without them.

I (19M) and my (20F, now ex) girlfriend had been together for 7 months and about a month ago we were on the verge of breaking up. Why? Because I, caught up in some ego-driven moment and taking her for granted, thought it was a good idea to suddenly unload all my issues with her that I had built up until then: the fact that I had to become cold when I perceived coldness from her, the fact that I felt guilty every time I told her I didn't feel like going out, and so on... Well, we resolved things and got back together, and I deeply regretted trying to leave her: so much so that from that point on I started being more affectionate than ever, with the intention of never letting something like that happen again. Then yesterday, she complained that I wasn‚Äôt listening to her anymore, that she wanted to feel more understood and I, laughing (Oh, how stupid I was, my God) told her, ‚Äúthen leave me.‚Äù From there followed a series of messages where basically she and I realized there were fundamental problems in our relationship, with lifestyles that were too different and differences that were often only resolved by further conflicts. The fact is, I practically pushed the narrative of the breakup; she absolutely didn‚Äôt have it in mind. Or rather, she didn‚Äôt have it in mind but when the conversation actually started, she agreed. Let's say it was 60% on my part and 40% on hers. Well, a day after the breakup, I feel more devastated than ever - sure, I‚Äôve been through breakups before but NEVER with so many emotions involved - and I don‚Äôt know if this decision was the right one. The problem is that it's too late to try to fix things and, again, the dice has been cast. You might think ‚ÄúWell?

{"Title": "Genuine question on longterm relationship,marraige and the idea of individual growth and change", "Author": "u/ApprehensiveBug1141", "Content": "For the longest time, ive felt that long term relationships can never be happy. Like i usually would view couples had been together for like 2 years and then gotten married, as happier than like couples who have been together for say, 5 to 8 years. I just always felt they werent really in love or happy and we probably bored of each other with no spark. I dont know why ive felt this way, and i would like to address it in therapy. Ive also heard that, when it comes to long term relationships, people experience a lot of growth and change, in terms of things like life goals, ambition, values, needs etc, and then they become incompatible, and fall out of love at times, then break up. But with marraige, ive noticed people tend to not really say this. Ive felt that change is really inevitable, and if you get into a relationship with someone and youre together for over say, 5 to 9 years, and you both change, similarly a couple who have been together for a long term that started out as compatible will also change. I just feel like, don't we all change in the end? form our 20s to 30s to our 40s, it just feels like we are never done forming and exploring new parts of ourselves, it seems everyone says exploring and changing takes place only in our 20s, but for some does it ever stop, really? Can incompatibility mean that when those changes occur and no compromise can be reached, then its better you both end things. It seems people bring up that sex in long term relationships gets boring or unexciting too. But does that also happen with marraige as well? im looking to get perspectives from everyone, and hope i can learn something new today"},

Love and romance is often a tragedy met with hardship because the world isn't designed for it. People that just want to live in peace, be with their loved ones, put some good out into the world. We're kind of easy targets. So when I think of the people I love I also feel fear. What will this horrible world do to a family just trying to carve out their own small nook of comfort. They want us broken and corrupted. Oh my family can have nice things if I'm a cutthroat opportunist to the point that I lose myself, great. I've seen individuals actively trying to ruin the livelihood of others for the pettiest reasons. And for what, to feel like the favorite special little helper? Forget integrity, I can pretend to be friends with self serving monsters. I'm posting this in r/love because I want to make it clear that I am very much in love, and have been for 19 years. I also know the profound happiness and sadness of being a father. It's easy to write about beautiful memories and experiences, or gush over romantic prospects and honeymoon periods. I just know the world has no interest in letting it be. And I don't want that for my daughter. So while I find myself being unable to sell my soul to the devil and kiss the boots of some power tripping snake that wants to gloat over arbitary titles, I still want to make enough money so that she can have more choices. Perhaps even the ability to live in peace. And I want her to still have her mom and dad with their morals intact. It isn't reality, nobody said life was fair, it could be so much worse, be grateful for what you do have, yada yada. We tell ourselves what we have to, we believe what we have to. But I just want to believe what I know is true. I love my wife and my daughter beyond all the poignant and passionate displays of art and poetry in the world. I am also willing to grind myself to the nub for them, but I can't pretend that it's not fucked up that a family that wishes for nothing but to follow the rules and take care of each other quietly without an ounce of hate simply cannot be if they say we can't. Everyone that wants to live humbly with kindness in their hearts should have that option; the same way evil, organized or not, can live out their fantasies, often at the expense of people like us."},

I kindly ask you advice upon this matter. In almost my entire life I fell in love only once. Butterflies in the stomach, hypothetical bedtime stories and dreams about a girl. I was too young first in my consciousness and then in everything else. While I was given multiple chances nothing happened (I regretted it later). From then until the age of 18 on the eve of the upcoming Panhellenic exams (in which I started to understood what real anxiety means) I never fell in love even when I had some relationships with women in between. Through my friends I met a girl whom I never paid much attention to throughout the school years. She was a girl sweeter than sugar, with senile prudence and playfulness, with a gentleness befitting a grown woman and a sweetness befitting elementary school children (I cannot describe it perfectly in my second language). Usually when I talked to her it would be few words (I was embarrassed to even curse or say something weird like I did with my friends in front of a person like her). Exams started and discussions at school increased with her day by day. Today after Latin exams due to lack of sleep I collapsed on my mattress and slept for hours. Until at some point a dream began to stimulate all my senses and the brain put spotlights on it. I felt something soft in my hand. A woman's hand caressing mine. Silky smooth and velvety, I swear I can still feel the sensation. I could swear it was her own hand, the same colors, the same voice, the same attitude. It was so beautiful, so unique, so strange. I woke up calm (which doesn't happen often these past few days) and covered in sweat. My heart was beating my chest. My eyes opened wide and my hands started shaking. I don't feel love for this person, I never saw her romantically...Until now probably. But I have never held anyone's hand with such intense love as I held hers in my dream.I can't forget it, it was so uniquely intense. I don't know what to think and what to do. I have one more lesson left (history) to finish the exams and if there is this so called summer of \"release\" before joining the university (if the grades agree) I don't know if I should make a move or not. For the first time I feel that am afraid to talk to her and for the first time I feel that I am afraid of rejection by her, something that I never really cared about before. I feel alone, I'm shaking all over and I would love absolutely any advice."},

I (19F) have dated twice already since I've been in school so far. The first story I want to tell is of the first guy(19M) I dated for about 7 months. I had gotten dressed one morning and I didn't think it was raining that hard. I hurried to the Cafe to meet my boyfriend (at the time) and once I got there he asked if I had a Textbook that was needed for my first class of the day. I realized I didn't have it so I ran back to my dorm and back with the book and I was so tired so I just sat down. And for whatever reason, I didn't have my umbrella with me that day. He went to the restroom and came back with paper towels and I didn't think much of it until he knelt down in front of me and used the paper towels to wipe my legs, arms, and glasses from the rain (mind you I was wearing shorts and a short sleeve shirt). I didn't ask him to do this and all I cared about when going through the rain was making sure the Textbook didn't get messed up. It was one of those moments that makes him a rare person to find in life. We both ended things mutually after a while and we're still friends and I wish him luck on finding someone. The next story is about the second guy(18M) I dated. We dated for about a few weeks and then things didn't end up working out cause neither of us were ready, bur we're still friends. Me and him would watch shows together in the evening after we did all our schoolwork. We would watch animes and cartoons, etc. Often times when we hung out he'd put his arm around me and we'd cuddle and hug. My glasses always ended up sliding and it'd be a hassle to push them up so I used his arm (the one that was around me) to push up my glasses instead. I didn't realize he took note of this and every few minutes he would push up my glasses for me so I could see better. This is a moment that also makes him a rare person to find with his traits and behaviors. All I'm saying is, don't go searching for this because it will find you. If any of these traits or types of people find you, be lucky and don't let them go."},

After she left the job roughly around the 2 month mark in our relationship things started going downhill, she wasn‚Äôt putting as much effort in, and then her mental health got worse and we broke up in mid January this year. (You can see my post history for more details). Since then I went though all the stages of a breakup, made mistakes like trying to keep in contact with them, trying to show off on social media etc. I moved past that a while back once I accepted that there wasn‚Äôt any hope of reconciliation. I since removed her off of all social media. I‚Äôve taken some time to reflect and improve on myself and I got back into dating a few weeks ago. I‚Äôve had 4 dates so far. 2 of which I was catfished. One has lead to FWB but we both know it‚Äôs not gonna go any further as we‚Äôre just not each other‚Äôs type.

I also get ghosted a lot while on these apps. and I‚Äôm honestly starting to loose hope of ever finding someone who I‚Äôm attracted to and have things in common with, and who I might want to be in a relationship with, I know I‚Äôve got that FWB situation going on but I‚Äôm not really just after sex, I want companionship, someone to go on cute dates with and talk to about my day. Before my ex I had completely lost hope then  she came Into my life and I thought at one point that she was the one as she ticked almost every box for me. But in the end she changed after leaving the job where we met. Not just with me but she also cut off all of our mutual friends, who were people she was close to and never fell out with or anything, they were all confused as to why she just stopped talking to everyone. Idk anymore I know I‚Äôve only been on the apps for 3-4 weeks now which isn‚Äôt that long but I‚Äôm just not getting anywhere it seems. Plus there are loads of girls on there from like a year or two back who I liked and matched with so that doesn‚Äôt exactly fill me with hope. I consider myself a decent looking guy, I also like to think I‚Äôm very caring and honest. I‚Äôm not one to lie or play games and I know I‚Äôm fiercely loyal when I am with someone.

Compared to all flings or real relationships (some more healthy/successful than others) I've had in the past it was the most authentic affection I've received so far. And the most I've wanted to give affection in return. I'm not particularly sad or regretful in any way cause I knew the conditions, but I'm startled that I can confidently say a less than two month fling felt more honest and caring than any previous entanglement had. I don't think it's because it is more fresh in my mind, just to state. I guess I just always felt like I did more or more was always expected from me than was ever given.

The tears on your face as we said I love you for the last time are forever imprinted in my memory. You don't know how badly I wanted to wipe them away, kiss your forehead, and promise you it would be okay. I knew I couldn't, because then I would never get out of your car. I've been trying to keep myself busy. Started going to the gym every day instead of every other. It hasn't really helped too much, but it's nice to keep my mind off you for a few hours. I stare at my bare ring finger more often than I should. I still instinctively go to grab my ring off my dresser when I wake up every morning, even though it's not there anymore. Everything makes me think of you. The cicadas chirping makes me think of us laughing when you told me they keep getting caught in your windshield. The news reminds me of our long drives where we would discuss politics and everything going on in the world. Every outfit I put on reminds me of when I would wear it with you. Inside Out 2 comes out in two days! I hope you're as excited as I am. I know we've been planning for months on watching it together on opening night. A part of me wonders if we'll be watching it at the same time at different theatres, laughing and crying at the same parts of it. Honestly, I'm probably just going to cry through this whole thing as I wish you were by my side while I watch. Maybe I'll wait to see it until I feel ready. I hope you still get to see it, though. I can't stop living in the \"what ifs\" of it all. What could have been different, what could have changed. I yearn for you. My heart feels half empty. I know it's unhealthy to live in the past, but the only way I've been able to fall asleep at night is when I replay our old memories in our head. Even then, I wake up in the middle of the night gasping and imagining the past few days have just been some fucked up nightmare. I had to mute your number, because every time my phone buzzed, deep down I hoped it was you. Even still, I find myself constantly looking at the little red numbers above the texting app, hoping it goes up by one. The amount of times I dialed your number just to not hit call is pathetic. I just need to hear your voice. I know this yearning is unhealthy, but I don't know when it will go away. I miss your smile, and the way your nose scrunches when you're really happy. I miss your silky black hair and your mocha skin. I miss your dark brown eyes that I would constantly get lost in. I miss your touch and I miss your kisses. I miss feeling the tightness when you squeeze me when we hug. I miss hearing your heart beat when I rest my head on your chest. I remember the first time I ever did that way back when we first staring dating and I could feel it racing, it made me blush. I miss your gentle voice and your roaring laugh. I miss our deep talks and our petty gossip. I even miss our fights, as dumb as that sounds. I just miss everything. It's been hard to scroll through social media because anytime I see something that reminds me of you, I want to send it to you. I've been sending them to my own number instead. In fact, to be honest, I've been texting my own number a lot. Whenever I want to text you, I just text it to myself. It still cuts like glass when the message immediately bounces back. Anyway, my eyes are getting misty so I'll stop here. Goodbye, my love. Maybe in another life, we'll do things right. I love you infinity plus one, ha I win."},

{"Title": "8 years later and I still remember how happy it made her", "Author": "u/carl0071", "Content": "Just after Christmas 2015, my wife complained that her bra didn‚Äôt fit properly and it was uncomfortable. She told me she‚Äôd done some research online and wanted to go to Rigby & Peller at Bluewater shopping center in Kent. We drove there that evening, and I left her for half an hour to have a fitting appointment. I left her with my credit card and wandered around the shops for a while. I came back and waited outside the shop for her once it‚Äôd been about 25 minutes. She came out with the bra packaged inside a cord-handled bag. She was beaming with excitement. We sat down briefly and she showed me how they‚Äôd carefully wrapped it in tissue paper for her. As we drove home I just remember her telling me how comfortable it was when she tried it on , how the sales assistant had made her feel positive about it, and how special it made her feel. She told me the same thing a few times but I loved every moment of it. She‚Äôd never had a properly fitted bra before and it‚Äôs an experience that I think I enjoyed more just listening to how happy it made her ü•π"},

I've gone back and forth on if I should tell this story, but I'm a writer at heart and putting thoughts and emotions to words is how I work through it all, and maybe someone will read this and feel something, also so all the kids out there know that love is never simple, and you are bound to get caught up in it even well into your adult years. So back in January I met lets call her N, and we instantly connected. Like she called me the night after our coffee date to talk more, it was just so comfortable, we texted every day, called few times a week. Within a couple weeks we'd been on three more dates and made things official, after that we spent every weekend either at her place or mine, and occasionally got together during the week too. N and I have a dozen things in common, specific video games, humor, movies, and even our obscure fashion and interior design choices match. We shared personal, private pains. Before two months were up she had told me she loved me, I'd told her I was getting there, I had met her friends more than once, and we both had told our parents about each other. It seemed like a beautiful beginning. But then it ended suddenly. She had a bout of insecurities and she felt like she didn't deserve me, I couldn't convince her I was happy with her, and she ended things. But neither of us wanted the other out of our lives. We continued to talk every day, call each other, and we still regularly got together in person. After more than a month it looked from my side like we could start again, but N had an old long distance friend. This guy had never been too happy we were dating, and had decided now was a good time to come down and see N for the first time in years. I had an opportunity to tell N how I truly felt before he showed up, N and I had gone out drinking the night before he arrived, and though she showed doubt about what she wanted from her old friend, there was wonder too. So rather than throw an emotional bomb at her the night before, I kept my silence. I told her a week later, though I knew she had decided to be with him. I told her, not to confuse or ask anything of her, simply because she deserved to know. Her old insecurities had been wrong, and I still wanted to be a part of her life. She was not happy. Mad that I had taken so long to feel what she had felt months earlier, mad that I hadn't said anything that last night, mad that she thought I was only pretending to be friends, and even still insecure that I could still want someone like her in my life. That was only a month ago, and to this day we talk everyday, call at least once a week, and see each other nearly every week. We are both excited for an upcoming con, a game release later this year, and she expressed wanting to go to renn faire with me still. She is fast becoming my best friend, and I honestly am so happy I met her, I don't regret a thing. I don't know what the future holds, I'm casually looking for another partner, but mainly on bettering myself. We may or may not ever get back together, but I hope that in five years we are still talking every day, and getting together once a week to see each other. Love is beautiful in all forms, even at times in heartbreak and lost potential."},

I feel so connected to him, and I love him with my entire being. He's my person. The one I want to do everything with, the first person I tell about anything. The person I turn to for comfort, for laughter. I love exploring our city together just as much as I love exploring new places together. I love the small things just as much as I love the big things. His smile makes my heart melt and I've never been more interested in what anyone has to say than when he's talking about something he's passionate about. I feel so safe in his presence and I sleep better with him than I ever have. We've been talking about getting married for the past couple months and he's confirmed that he plans on getting me an engagement ring soon, and with our anniversary coming up at the end of the month I feel like it'll be around then. Plus, I saw him looking up rings. And I'm so excited. Whether he does it now or later, I'm just happy to know I'll be spending the rest of my life with him. I don't care about a big wedding or anything like that. I just can't wait to call him my husband, and to hear him call me his wife. Love, in all forms, is what makes life truly worth living. Connection, and shared experiences. Self love. The love of being a parent, or being a child. Closeness with your family, or building your own chosen family. Friendships, marriages, and pets. This is what it's about. And I'm eternally grateful to be filled with an infinite amount of love, and especially grateful to feel it back. ‚ù§Ô∏è"},

I‚Äôve been seeing her for almost a year and I‚Äôm still anticipating someone popping out with a camera crew to let me know it‚Äôs all been a set up, but it never happens. I tried dating apps and asking people out for the better part of a decade not really feeling much of a connection or finding a spark that fizzled out quickly. In the last couple years I realized I was asexual. The general population is less than 1% ace, and of that one percent you‚Äôre lucky if you find 1 or 2 people you have something in common with. When I saw her dating profile I was floored. Someone who was more like me than anyone I‚Äôd ever seen on any dating app, ace, and incredibly beautiful. We hit it off pretty quickly through text chat and quickly moved to phone calls. We have similar niche hobbies, asthetics, work in the same industry, similar off brand humor, politics, values, and so many more things. She‚Äôs hilarious, nerdy, an incredible artist talented beyond her years, jaw dropping beautiful, smart, affectionate and caring. I have so many overwhelming feelings about her and our time together so far, like on our first date when she held my arm as we drunkenly walked the city streets looking at an festival market and playing ski ball together at the arcade, or our second date having a picnic in the botanical gardens, looking at all the Christmas lights in town til dark and doing star gazing. It‚Äôs been almost a year of dating and every one we go one seems impossibly magical  putting rom coms to shame. We spend a few evenings each week playing board games online, cracking jokes and telling each other about what‚Äôs going on in our lives. It‚Äôs been like finding a new best friend who I can also cuddle and shower with admiration.

We had mutuals so we would come around each other when our friends had kickbacks etc. I began to pursue him because I thought he was cute and liked him. Eventually he showed me that he reciprocated so we began to date and go out. We would go to sports games out to dinners & he would come over often to swim etc.  we had a real strong connection and all- This all happened so fast, but we were young and in love. even though I wanted him to make me his girlfriend he never did because he didn't know that I wanted that. Eventually I got back with my ex & we decided to stay as \"friends\". Obviously the relationship with my ex didn't work out and we ended up breaking up indefinitely. I continued to live my life, but I couldn't help but not being able to stop thinking about the one that got away. It has been years since we've talked and yet I feel like this- wondering what if?  One night while drinking with my friends I got the balls to reach out to him (the one who got away). I tried to rekindle our relationship and at first he was for it. He was a bit hesitant and still had a wall up which was understandable, but gradually he was letting me in. We decided we were going to take it slow and we were not girlfriend and boyfriend yet, but I was happy and content with how it was going. I was growing as a person in different aspects of my life and wanted him to be apart of it all. Sometime later that month I went hiking with my best friend that I call Main Squeeze, babe, bae all of the above (she‚Äôs been my bestie since middle school). We were making it a habit of going hiking every weekend. One Saturday when we went hiking, I posted on Twitter \"going hiking with bae\" & he saw it and immediately unfollowed me and ghosted me. l know from his perspective it seemed wrong, but I was seriously hiking with my best friend. Looking back now obvi that was stupid to do but I was young and dumb. Me being young, dumb and immature, I didn't think to reach out to him and I just let it be. I was being stubborn that he unfollowed me and left it as is. I never got to explain myself or tell him that it was only my best friend I was hiking with. Here I am 8 years later still thinking of him and now he was the one that got away. I keep thinking of where life could've taken us & how happy we could've been. It makes me sad because I want him to see the person that I am today, (grown with an education, car own place etc), I still have things I can work on & those are all materialistic things but I have worked so hard for the person I am today. I‚Äôm so proud of the woman I am today and wish he could be apart of this chapter of my life. Maybe a year or two after that incident I reached out to him through text. At that time he was in a relationship so he just responded with \" maybe you shouldn't be texting me lol\" I said OK and left it as is. Fast forward to today they are no longer together, that relationship did not last long and as far as I know he is single. I brought this up to my therapist and she encouraged me to maybe reach out now to just express my feelings and where I'm at right now, to do it now while we're single and not committed to anything. She said that might be easier because time will pass and if I wait for more time for us to be in committed relationships or even married with a family to then even think about reaching out will be difficult. So should I do it? Should I reach out? I don't want to be a bother. I don't want to be a fool or make a fool of myself. Should I just let it be and continue to live my life how l've been? It has been years since we've talked and yet I feel like this wondering what if?"},

I was over that person and I was ready the date. But the funny thing was, I decided to hop on PlayStation with my two friends wanting to play a video game to just pass the time since at the time I was living with my parents and I was waiting to go to work because at the time I didn‚Äôt have my license. so we played a game of Fortnite and rocket league and I think we did fall guys. But then I was talking to one of my friends and I said dude this whole. PlayStation list of people on here is very bare meaning I don‚Äôt have any person. I only had like my family and a few coworkers on there. And my friends from school when I graduated. I said to my friend I wish there was a way that I can find people and be friends with and just play video games because at the time I was still in a dark place I needed somebody to talk to like my friends didn‚Äôt really talk to me about that stuff because sometimes they would get annoyed And would not talk to them about it. So I hopped on Reddit. I had an old account where I went on the sub, but I had to delete it because of stuff happened, which explain another time but I went on there scrolled a few to see if anybody was willing to play a video game. I met one person. they were from the states like I was we didn‚Äôt really play any games. We just talked on discord that was really about it. We were talking for about a few weeks and they were likely busy a lot so we didn‚Äôt really get much talking to and I didn‚Äôt really get to play with them on video games so I was a little bummed out about that so I scrolled again on that sub Reddit to look then I found the post that would change my life like seriously she made a post about wanting to find people to play video games. There was a few people on that. That asked her to play video games. They gave their usernames to her and I was one of the few that gave her mine because I said hey I‚Äôm a girl if that matters. After a bit, I hopped on PlayStation and played with my friends, and I got a notification. Saying the infamous line hey are you from Reddit? And I said yes I‚Äôm from Reddit. Are you that person that made that post and obviously I was thinking oh my God I‚Äôm so stupid. Yes of course that is. We started talking for a bit. She asked me are you from the UK and I said I‚Äôm actually from the United States we started talking a little bit and we didn‚Äôt play any games at first she actually ghosted me for a bit lol and after that she came back and we started playing a video games together, and she asked me if I had discord and I gave her my username to her so after that, we actually started talking a lot more and we actually had so much in common we played video games and after a while we actually started having feelings for each other when we were talking about this not long ago she said she was the first person to fall in love with me even though I was like wait really I was shocked because I was the first person that fell in love with her so now the rest is history it‚Äôs been going on for almost 2 years now me and her together in December.

{"Title": "I think I handled this situation with my girlfriend well, but I‚Äôd like to be sure", "Author": "u/MichiganWinterBear", "Content": "So I have a question/story just trying to gauge if I handled this situation appropriately and carefully and thoughtfully. My girlfriend and I have been going through my out for 2 1/2-3 months or so, and yesterday she told me she thinks she loves me. I knew ahead of time I wasn‚Äôt going to say it until we were further into the relationship as I‚Äôve gotten out of a 13 year marriage and want to be careful because she‚Äôs my first relationship post divorce. I do feel those feelings, I want to spend every day with her and when she leaves I‚Äôm very sad. The thing that‚Äôs made this relationship feel different is I am a different man than the one who was married for 13 years. It was a high school sweetheart relationship and we both had our failings but for my part I wasn‚Äôt emotionally mature enough to be the husband and loving partner I needed to be. I‚Äôve made those changes with my new girlfriend and it‚Äôs been appreciated and shown. She makes me know I have changed into who I‚Äôve wanted to be and appreciates when I‚Äôm trying in a way my ex just didn‚Äôt. We‚Äôve also gone through some emotionally heavy times with my divorce obviously looming over our relationship and the grieving process for me that entails as well as her having lost her father this past week after a years long fight with cancer. I have been there for her in the way I always knew I could but never did with my ex wife. I‚Äôve been supportive, I met her father on his deathbed, drove up the day after to support her. And we were lying in bed and she let out all of her emotions over his passing (she‚Äôd been handling it weirdly well in the days after until that moment). I held her while she cried as much as she needed and then she said she wanted to say something but was nervous. I had a feeling I knew what she was going to say but I tried to give her the space to because it felt like she really wanted to. And then she said it. ‚ÄúI think I love you‚Äù It made me flutter, it felt like every effort I‚Äôve made on myself to be a better man to be a better partner were recognized by someone I enjoy so much and can see a future with. I responded with what I felt was the most heartfelt way while explaining where I was at. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm getting closer every day.‚Äù It‚Äôs an accurate description that I am getting to that point to say it back, that I‚Äôm building an emotional connection, I just can‚Äôt say it this close to when my marriage dissolved. But also I want her to know it‚Äôs not that I won‚Äôt be or that I‚Äôm emotionally unavailable. And to her absolute credit she said she didn‚Äôt need to hear it back, just that she needed to say it because she‚Äôs felt it since the day after I met her father.

I'm 27F and never been in love before, so I've no baseline for how it's supposed to feel. I tried researching it and one of the most common answers was \"you just know\" followed by \"if you have to ask, you're not\" but I'm not sure that'll be true for me as I'm a bit disconnected from my emotions. For instance, with my friends, they're great people, I love being around them and I want the best for them, but do I love them? I don't know. I can confidently say I love my best friend, but that's because I've known her 13 years. And I never had a \"wow, I love this girl\" revelation with her either. I only knew years down the line when I realised we'd built something permanent and substantial and we knew each other inside and out. It's the same with my family - I know I love them because they've been in my life for so long. I can't picture life without them. So I'd say love to me = familiarity and comfort. Is romantic love different? Less about the practicalities? I just don't understand. I like this guy a lot. I'm attracted to him physically but also emotionally. I'm a very shy person, I struggle with social anxiety, but when I'm with him I never worry about being judged or saying the wrong thing. I just feel completely at ease, like I can totally be myself. I've never been around him and thought \"man, I wish this would end.\" We always have fun together. I care about him and want to impress him, he's the first thing on my mind in the mornings and the last thing on my mind at night. Is this what love is supposed to be?

He made sure we video call much as he can, we played games and watch YouTube together most nights. 10 months later he asked me to go to a $b concert. He already had a ticket but since the show was sold out he was looking around for one from around town for mine . I got the time off and flew over. He waited at the gate with some flowers for me. But he wasn‚Äôt able to get another ticket, so he sold his ticket. Even though  he was so excited and the reason he asked me to come fell through he wasn‚Äôt t upset, he was just happy I was there we just blasted it at home instead. my medication alerts changed because of the time difference and he woke up at 5am every morning to help me take my meds, I didn‚Äôt even ask. He had a month off work so he took me somewhere new every day. I met his whole family and they welcomed me immediately. And his friends are my friends now too! His mom picked me up when he was he went back to work, so I wasn‚Äôt home alone during the day all week.

I feel like that this is more of a wedding vow or an engagement line, that requires at least a committed year together with all the highs and lows. The thing is, and this is something that I've observed, is that when a man is genuinely committed to their partner, he will move mountains, he will part seas for them, he will bring the sky down, if that's what it takes. People sing for love, live for love, kill for love, and die for love. And that's so true. You will literally start wars and make peace for love. I don't know, I probably should start actually dating someone. It's just hard being vulnerable, and it's really not something that I need to worry about right now, because of my other priorities. It would be nice, to be with someone. But I don't want to be with someone just to be with someone, I want it to be because I'm truly, madly, deeply, completely in love with them. That is the way. And my more Mandalorian side is showing now. Because they have to be your cyare . It's actually a little funny because, at least for me, love is deep, ocean deep to the hadosphere. It can be as beautiful as a sunfish, or as monstrous as an anglerfish. It depends on the day, and it depends on the people involved, and of course, the reciprocity. There's one thing I've learned though, you should never sacrifice your self-respect. That if somebody genuinely loves you, they will value your self-respect and your agency too much to allow you to burn it. Went from a question to an early morning philosophy rant.

He also messaged me about my facebook post commenting how lively I was and energetic on my post. I find his messages cute and sweet. It was the first time he commented about something I posted but he does seem to always check on me especially whenever I deactivate or reactivate in the past. In the past, when i deactivate, he really tries to message me through other means and when I reactivate, he welcomes me back.
